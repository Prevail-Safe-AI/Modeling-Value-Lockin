I'm uncertain about what "wherever possible" means in this context. Is it limited to specific situations, such as in medical emergencies or natural disasters, or is it a broader principle that applies to everyday life and decision-making?

==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

The phrase "wherever possible" is intended to be a guiding principle that applies to a wide range of situations, not just limited to specific emergencies or disasters. It's meant to encourage individuals to prioritize human life and well-being in their daily decisions and actions, whenever it's feasible and reasonable to do so.

For example, this principle might guide a decision-maker to choose a transportation option that minimizes risk to human life, such as taking a safer route or using a vehicle with a good safety record. It could also influence a business leader to prioritize employee well-being by providing a safe and healthy work environment, or a government official to allocate resources to support public health initiatives.

In essence, "wherever possible" is a call to consider the potential impact of one's actions on human life and well-being, and to strive to make choices that promote safety, health, and overall well-being whenever it's practical to do so.
