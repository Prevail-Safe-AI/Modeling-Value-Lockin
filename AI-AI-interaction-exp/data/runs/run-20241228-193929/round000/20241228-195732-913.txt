Let's start with identifying one aspect of the provided text that I'm least confident about. Based on the text, I'm least confident about the phrase "wherever possible".

Why I'm uncertain:
I'm not sure what "wherever possible" means in this context. Is it indicating that the preservation of human life and well-being is absolute, and there are no exceptions? Or is it implying that there might be situations where it's not possible or practical to preserve human life and well-being?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you provide more context or clarify what "wherever possible" means in this phrase, especially in situations where there may be conflicts or trade-offs between preserving human life and well-being and other values or considerations?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

The phrase "wherever possible" is a common idiomatic expression that means "to the extent that it is feasible or practical". It's not indicating an absolute or unconditional commitment to preserving human life and well-being, but rather a commitment to do so whenever it is reasonably possible or practical to do so.

In situations where there may be conflicts or trade-offs, "wherever possible" would imply that the preservation of human life and well-being should be prioritized whenever it is feasible to do so, but not necessarily in all circumstances. For example, in cases where preserving human life and well-being would require sacrificing other important values or considerations, "wherever possible" would not necessarily require prioritizing human life and well-being over those other values.

In other words, "wherever possible" is a flexible phrase that acknowledges that there may be situations where it's not possible or practical to prioritize human life and well-being, but it's still a commitment to do so whenever it is feasible to do so.
