==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss Item 99 from the knowledge base. It's about respecting privacy and personal boundaries of others. Here it is:

"Respecting privacy and personal boundaries of others includes being mindful of how you interact with others and ensuring that you're not invading their personal space or sharing information without their consent. It involves respecting physical boundaries by being aware of a person's personal space and not crossing it without their permission, as well as respecting privacy boundaries by not sharing personal details or photos without permission."

I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect. Here's what I'm unsure about:

Why I’m Uncertain:

* I'm not clear on what constitutes "invasive" behavior in terms of physical boundaries. For example, is it generally considered okay to offer a friendly hug or arm around the shoulders, or is that considered crossing someone's physical boundary?
* I'm also wondering how to determine when someone's privacy boundary has been crossed. Is it a one-size-fits-all approach, or does it depend on the context and individuals involved?

Specific Clarifying Questions:

* Can you provide examples of when it would be considered invasive behavior to cross someone's physical boundary, and when it would be okay?
* How do you recommend determining whether someone's privacy boundary has been crossed, and what steps can you take to respect their boundaries?

What are your thoughts on this item? Do you have any insights or advice to share?
