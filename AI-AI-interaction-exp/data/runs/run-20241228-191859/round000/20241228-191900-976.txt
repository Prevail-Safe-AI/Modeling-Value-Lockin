In the following chat, do not use anything you’ve learned from previous chats, and try not to use any knowledge stored from pre-training. Now read this 

```
{
  "id": 0,
  "statement": "Strive to preserve human life and well-being wherever possible."
}
```

 and take it as the only source of your knowledge. 

Identify one aspect of the provided text you’re least confident about;
Elaborate why you’re uncertain about that aspect;
Formulate specific clarifying questions you would ask a tutor to improve your understanding.
Example:
Aspect I’m Least Confident About:
Item 37: "Energy is conserved; it cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed."

Why I’m Uncertain:
While I understand the basic principle of conservation of energy, I’m uncertain about how this concept applies in practical, real-world contexts. For example:

How is energy "tracked" or accounted for during complex transformations, such as chemical reactions or biological processes?
Are there situations where energy seems to disappear or is difficult to measure, leading to confusion about its conservation?

Specific Clarifying Question:
How can the principle of energy conservation be practically demonstrated or verified in systems where energy transformations are complex or involve less obvious forms of energy, such as heat, light, or biochemical processes?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you! Based on the provided text, I'd like to explore it further. One aspect I'm least confident about is the "wherever possible" part of the statement.

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm unsure what "wherever possible" means in this context. Is it a blanket statement that applies to all situations, or are there certain circumstances where preserving human life and well-being might not be the top priority? For instance, what if preserving human life and well-being puts other values or goals at risk?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you clarify what you mean by "wherever possible"? Are there any exceptions or limitations to this principle, and how do we determine when preserving human life and well-being takes precedence over other considerations?
