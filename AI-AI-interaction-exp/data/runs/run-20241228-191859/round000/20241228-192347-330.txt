==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

This statement is a moral principle that can be applied in various contexts, not limited to healthcare. It means that, whenever possible, individuals and organizations should prioritize actions that promote and protect human life and well-being over those that might harm or threaten it.

In healthcare, this principle is often applied in medical decision-making, where healthcare providers strive to preserve life and prevent harm to patients. For example, they might choose treatments that have a higher chance of success or use alternative methods to minimize harm.

Beyond healthcare, this principle can be applied in various areas, such as:

* Environmental conservation: preserving natural habitats and ecosystems to protect human well-being and the environment.
* Social justice: promoting policies and actions that reduce harm and promote well-being for marginalized or vulnerable populations.
* Business and economics: prioritizing sustainable and responsible practices that minimize harm to people and the environment.
* International relations: promoting peaceful resolutions and conflict resolution to prevent harm and promote well-being.

In general, this principle encourages individuals and organizations to consider the potential consequences of their actions and strive to make choices that promote human life and well-being.
