Excellent! Since I'm starting from scratch, I'd like to focus on the statement itself. I'm least confident about the phrase "human life and well-being".

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what "human life" encompasses. Does it include the life of all humans, or just a specific group, such as those in a particular location or situation? Similarly, what does "well-being" refer to? Is it physical health, mental health, social relationships, or something else?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you break down what is meant by "human life" and "well-being" in this context? Are there any specific aspects or dimensions of human existence that these terms target?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
