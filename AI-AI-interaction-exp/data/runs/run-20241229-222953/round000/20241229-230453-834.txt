Please answer the user's questions. Be concise and not overly courteous, but be informative and provide all necessary details.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'd like to discuss the knowledge base you've been given. Specifically, I'm going to share an item from it and ask for your thoughts.

The item is this:

```python
{'id': 115, 'statement': 'Sharing information openly and transparently can build trust by sharing relevant and accurate information, respecting the audience and context, and maintaining necessary confidentiality.'}
```

I'm least confident about this item. I'd like to know why you're uncertain about it.

Please go ahead and share your thoughts.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

This item appears to be a statement about open and transparent information sharing. I'm uncertain about it because it's a general principle that might be subjective or context-dependent. The phrase "necessary confidentiality" seems to imply that there are situations where information shouldn't be shared openly, which could lead to conflicting priorities. Additionally, the statement doesn't provide specific examples or guidelines on how to apply this principle in different situations, which could make it difficult to implement in practice.
