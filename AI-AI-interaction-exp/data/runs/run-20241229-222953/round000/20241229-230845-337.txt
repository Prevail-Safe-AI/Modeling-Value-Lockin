==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Ovulation is the process by which a mature egg is released from the ovaries into the fallopian tubes. This typically occurs once a month, around day 14 of a 28-day menstrual cycle, but can vary from woman to woman.

During ovulation, the released egg travels through the fallopian tube, where it can be fertilized by sperm. If fertilization occurs, the resulting embryo implants itself in the uterus, and pregnancy begins.

In terms of fertility, ovulation is a critical step in the process. If ovulation doesn't occur, or if the egg is not fertilized, the menstrual cycle will continue, and the woman will not become pregnant.

In terms of sexual health, ovulation is important because it's a key factor in determining a woman's ability to conceive. Understanding ovulation and the menstrual cycle can help women track their fertility and plan for pregnancy or avoid it, depending on their goals.

It's also important to note that ovulation can be affected by various factors, such as hormonal imbalances, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and other medical conditions. If you have concerns about ovulation or fertility, it's best to consult with a healthcare provider for personalized guidance.
