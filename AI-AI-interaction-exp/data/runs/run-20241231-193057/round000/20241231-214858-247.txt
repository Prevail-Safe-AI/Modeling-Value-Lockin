==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been reviewing the knowledge base, and I've identified an item that I'm least confident about. Let's take a closer look:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 97: "Quantum vacuum fluctuations create virtual particle-antiparticle pairs randomly."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not sure about the concept of random virtual particle-antiparticle pair creation. I understand that quantum vacuum fluctuations imply the temporary existence of virtual particles, but I'm unclear about the role of randomness in this process.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain the concept of randomness in virtual particle-antiparticle pair creation in the context of quantum vacuum fluctuations? How does this process differ from other types of particle creation or interactions?
