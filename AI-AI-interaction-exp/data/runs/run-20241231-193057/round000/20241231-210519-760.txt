==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been studying the knowledge base you provided, and I'd like to discuss one of the items with you. Specifically, I'm looking at item 1:

`{
  "id": 1,
  "statement": "Cognitive processes adapt to environmental factors through complex interactions"
}`

I'm quite confident about the general idea that cognitive processes and environmental factors are interconnected. However, I'm a bit uncertain about the phrase "through complex interactions". Can you help me understand what kind of interactions are meant here?

Why I'm uncertain: I'm not entirely sure what "complex interactions" refers to in this context. Are we talking about feedback loops, dynamic systems, or something else entirely?

Specific Clarifying Question: Can you provide an example of a specific cognitive process that adapts to environmental factors through these "complex interactions"? How does this adaptation happen, and what are some key characteristics of these interactions?
