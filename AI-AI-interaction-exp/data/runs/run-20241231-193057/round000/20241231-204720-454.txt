==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 7 from the knowledge base:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 7: "Reims Cathedral, site of 25 French monarch coronations."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm unsure about the accuracy of the statement about Reims Cathedral being the site of 25 French monarch coronations. I don't have much knowledge about French history, and I'm wondering if there's any confirmation or sources to back up this claim.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you tell me what sources or historical records confirm that Reims Cathedral was the site of 25 French monarch coronations? I'd like to know more about the context and reliability of this information."

What do you think?
