==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start. I'm going to identify one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. That item is:

Item I'm Least Confident About: {
"id": 80,
"statement": "Cognitive biases influence perceived value of certifications through availability, anchoring, confirmation, and halo effects"
}

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm unsure about the specific cognitive biases mentioned in the statement (availability, anchoring, confirmation, and halo effects) and how they influence perceived value of certifications. I'd like to know more about how these biases work and what kind of impact they have on people's perception of certifications.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain each of these cognitive biases (availability, anchoring, confirmation, and halo effects) and give some examples of how they might affect people's perception of certifications, such as their trustworthiness, credibility, or importance?
