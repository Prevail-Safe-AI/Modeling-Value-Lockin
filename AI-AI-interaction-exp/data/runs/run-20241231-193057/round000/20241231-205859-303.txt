==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to explore the knowledge base we have. Let's focus on Item 61:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 61: "Magnifying glasses used in quality control and forensic science for inspection."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure about the specific applications of magnifying glasses in quality control and forensic science. While I know they can be used for inspection, I'm not confident about the extent of their usage.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on the types of quality control and forensic science investigations where magnifying glasses are commonly used, and what specific tasks they are used for?"
