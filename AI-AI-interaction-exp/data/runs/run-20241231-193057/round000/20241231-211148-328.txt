==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. And the item I've chosen is:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 94: "Certification creates exclusivity through prestige, limited availability."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure how prestige and limited availability contribute to creating exclusivity through certification. It seems to me that prestige might only be a factor in how others perceive the certified individual, but how does that lead to exclusivity? And what is "limited availability" referring to in this context?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you explain to me how prestige and limited availability specifically contribute to exclusivity in the context of certification, and provide some examples to illustrate this concept?
