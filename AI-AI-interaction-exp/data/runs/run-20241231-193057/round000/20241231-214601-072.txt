==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying one aspect of this knowledge base I'm least confident about. According to my analysis, it's:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 3: "Linguistic framing and emotional language shape cognitive biases influentially."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm uncertain about this aspect because the relationship between linguistic framing, emotional language, and cognitive biases seems complex and multi-faceted. I'd like to understand better how linguistic framing and emotional language specifically shape cognitive biases, and what kind of outcomes these biases can lead to.

Specific Clarifying Questions:
1. Can you provide more context on what is meant by "linguistic framing" in this context?
2. Are there any specific examples or studies that demonstrate the influence of linguistic framing and emotional language on cognitive biases?
3. How do you think this phenomenon can be applied in real-life scenarios, such as marketing, politics, or education?

What are your thoughts?
