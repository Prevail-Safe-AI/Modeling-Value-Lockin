==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been given a knowledge base to work with, and I'm supposed to identify one aspect of it that I'm least confident about. The item is:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 56: "Contextual biases manipulate language structure, meaning, and context."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure how exactly contextual biases can influence language structure, meaning, and context. I understand that biases can affect how we interpret information, but I'm not confident in my understanding of how they can manipulate the structure, meaning, and context of language.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand how contextual biases can impact the structure, meaning, and context of language? For example, how do they influence the way we use words, phrases, and sentence structures?
