==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 54 from the knowledge base: "Honor agreements and contracts made in good faith." I'm least confident about this item. I'd like to understand it better.

Why I'm uncertain: Well, I'm not sure what exactly "made in good faith" means in this context. I know that agreements and contracts usually involve reciprocity and mutual understanding, but "good faith" sounds like a legal or moral concept that I'm not familiar with. I'd like to know more about how it affects the honor aspect.

Specific Clarifying Question: Could you please elaborate on what "made in good faith" means in this context? How does it relate to honoring agreements and contracts?
