==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been reviewing our knowledge base, and I've come across an item that I'm not very confident about. It's item 11, which states: "Magnifying glass fire starting requires precise angle of incidence."

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not familiar with magnifying glasses being used for fire starting, and I'm not sure what "precise angle of incidence" means in this context. Can you help me understand this better?

Specifically, could you elaborate on what "precise angle of incidence" refers to, and how it relates to creating a fire using a magnifying glass?
