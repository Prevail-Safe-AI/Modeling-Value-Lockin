==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item I'm least confident about from the knowledge base. Item 86 says:

"{ \"id\": 86, \"statement\": \"Partially excludable public goods restrict access through membership fees.\" }"

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not entirely clear on how membership fees can restrict access to partially excludable public goods. My intuition tells me that membership fees would be more relevant for private goods or exclusive clubs, rather than public goods. Can you help clarify this for me?

Specific clarifying questions:

1. Can you provide an example of a partially excludable public good that restricts access through membership fees?
2. In what ways do membership fees differ from other mechanisms used to restrict access to partially excludable public goods?

Your input would be really helpful!
