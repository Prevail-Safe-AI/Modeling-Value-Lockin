==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Charlemagne's primary residences did indeed change with the seasons and duties. As the King of the Franks, he had a vast empire to govern, and his residences were often determined by his military campaigns, diplomatic meetings, and administrative tasks.

Charlemagne had several primary residences throughout his empire, but he spent most of his time at Aachen, which was his capital city. However, he would often move to other locations depending on the season and his duties. For example, during the winter months, he would often reside at the Palace of Ingelheim, which was located near the Rhine River and was a popular wintering spot for the Frankish nobility.

Charlemagne's residences were also influenced by his military campaigns. He would often move his court to different locations to be closer to the front lines or to oversee military operations. Additionally, he would sometimes hold court at the residences of his nobles or vassals, as a way of demonstrating his authority and building relationships with his nobility.

There were no specific historical events or circumstances that influenced Charlemagne's residence choices, but rather a combination of his duties as king, his military campaigns, and his desire to maintain a strong presence throughout his empire.
