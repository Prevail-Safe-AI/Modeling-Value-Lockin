==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been given a knowledge base, and I'd like to reflect on one item that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the items, I've chosen item 65, which says:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 65: "Linguistic factors influence contextual biases through tone, vocabulary, syntax.""

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure how linguistic factors, such as tone, vocabulary, and syntax, can specifically influence contextual biases. Is it that these linguistic elements can shape people's attitudes, opinions, or behaviors in certain contexts? Or is there a more nuanced relationship between language and context? I'm intrigued by this concept but feel like I'm missing something crucial.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you help me understand how tone, vocabulary, and syntax can, in fact, influence contextual biases? What are some concrete examples or research studies that demonstrate this relationship?
