==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd love to explore this knowledge base with you. Let's start with this item:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 19: "Modifying soil for crops requires adapting techniques and methods."

Why I'm Uncertain:
Honestly, I don't have direct experience with farming or modifying soil, so I'm uncertain about the specifics of how it works. I'd love to learn more about what kind of techniques and methods are involved.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain how exactly do farmers or agricultural experts adapt techniques and methods when modifying soil for crops? Are there any specific tools or practices they use?

What are your thoughts on this?
