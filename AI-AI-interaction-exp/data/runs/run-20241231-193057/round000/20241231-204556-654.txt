==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. Based on what I've read, I'm going to identify one aspect that I'm least confident about. Here it is:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 53: "Reims was ceremonial center for French monarch coronations, not capital."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure why Reims was considered a ceremonial center for French monarch coronations. Was it because of its historical significance, its physical location, or something else? Additionally, I'm unsure what constitutes a "ceremonial center" versus a capital.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what made Reims a significant ceremonial center for French monarch coronations, and how does this differ from being the capital of France?
