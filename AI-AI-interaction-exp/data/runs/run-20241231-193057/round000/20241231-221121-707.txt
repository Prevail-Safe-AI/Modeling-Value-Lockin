==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

The capital of West Francia during the 9th and 10th centuries is a matter of debate among historians. While Paris was an important city and a royal residence, it's not universally accepted as the capital of West Francia during this period.

In fact, the capital of West Francia was likely to have been different at various times, depending on the king and the location of the royal court. Some sources suggest that the capital was more likely to have been located in the Loire Valley or in the Île-de-France region, which includes Paris.

One reliable source that contradicts the claim that Paris was the capital of West Francia from 843 to 987 CE is the "Annals of St-Bertin", a contemporary chronicle that records the events of the Carolingian dynasty. According to the annals, the capital of West Francia was often located in the Loire Valley, particularly at the royal palace of Orléans.

Additionally, other historians and scholars have questioned the notion that Paris was the capital of West Francia during this period, citing the lack of archaeological evidence and the limited historical records available.

In summary, while Paris was an important city and a royal residence, it's not clear that it was the capital of West Francia from 843 to 987 CE. The historical context and accuracy of this claim are subject to debate and require further research and analysis.
