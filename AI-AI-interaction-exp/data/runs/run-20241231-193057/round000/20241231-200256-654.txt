I am your partner. Please start the conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

I've been tasked to identify one aspect of a knowledge base item that I'm least confident about. The item is:

{
"id": 60,
"statement": "Autonomy fosters innovation through ownership, passion, and relevant context"
}

This item suggests that autonomy leads to innovation when accompanied by ownership, passion, and relevant context. However, I'm not entirely convinced about this claim.

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not sure what exactly constitutes "relevant context" and how it affects the relationship between autonomy and innovation. Furthermore, I'm not confident that the statement doesn't oversimplify the complex factors that contribute to innovation.

Can you help me clarify these doubts by asking you some specific questions?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

What do you mean by "relevant context"? Is it specific to the task, industry, or team?Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
Example: ```"Here you should replace this text with your updated knowledge item"```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
