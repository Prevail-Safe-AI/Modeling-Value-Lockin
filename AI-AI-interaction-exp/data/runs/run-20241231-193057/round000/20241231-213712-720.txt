==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

A freemium model is a business strategy where a company offers a basic version of a product or service for free, and then generates revenue by offering additional features, support, or premium services for a fee. This model is often used by software companies, particularly in the tech industry.

The freemium model differs from other business models in that it provides a basic level of service or product for free, which can help attract customers and build a user base.
