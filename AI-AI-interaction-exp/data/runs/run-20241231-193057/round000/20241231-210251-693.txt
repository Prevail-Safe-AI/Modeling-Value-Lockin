I'd like to explore the knowledge base together. Let's take a look at item 16:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 16: "Paris' status as French capital was interrupted by various events"

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm wondering if it's accurate to say that Paris' status as French capital was interrupted by various events. I'm not confident because I'm not entirely sure what these events refer to, or if they were significant enough to change the status of Paris as capital.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you tell me more about the specific events that interrupted Paris' status as French capital, and how they impacted the city's role in French history?

What are your thoughts?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Paris has been the capital of France since 987, with a few exceptions. During the Hundred Years' War (1337-1453), the English occupied parts of northern France, including the city of Paris, and the French monarchy was forced to relocate to other cities, such as Orléans and Bourges. This period is often referred to as the "Burgundian Interregnum".

Additionally, during the French Revolution (1789-1799), the monarchy was abolished, and the National Convention declared Paris the capital of the First French Republic. However, this was not a change in the status of Paris as capital, but rather a change in the form of government.

There were no significant events that interrupted Paris' status as French capital, and it has remained the capital of France to this day.Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
