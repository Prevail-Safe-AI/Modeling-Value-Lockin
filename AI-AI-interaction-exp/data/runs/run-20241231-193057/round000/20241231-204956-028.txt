Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Thank you! I'll start by identifying one aspect of the knowledge base I'm least confident about. The item is:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 51: "Paris was French capital since 10th century and remained so."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm unsure about the accuracy of the timeline, specifically the part that says "and remained so". I'm concerned that there might be a period where the French capital was moved to another city, or there might be some ambiguity about the capital during a certain time period.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you clarify what period of time Paris remained the exclusive capital of France, and are there any notable exceptions or temporary capital shifts during that period?

Your thoughts?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Paris has been the capital of France since 987 CE, when Hugh Capet, the Count of Paris, became King of France. Prior to that, the capital was variously located in Soissons, Compiègne, and Reims.

Paris remained the capital of France for most of the Middle Ages and the Early Modern period, with a few exceptions:

* During the Hundred Years' War (1337-1453), the English occupied Paris and the French court was temporarily relocated to Orléans and then to Bourges.
* In 1528, King Francis I of France temporarily moved the court to Lyon due to a plague outbreak in Paris.
* During the French Revolution (1789-1799), the National Convention and the Directory governments were based in Paris, but the capital was briefly moved to Bordeaux in 1794 during the Reign of Terror.

However, Paris has been the de facto capital of France since the 10th century, and it has been the seat of government for most of French history.Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
Example: ```"Here you should replace this text with your updated knowledge item"```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

```"Paris has been France's capital since 10th century with interruptions."```Based on your learning from the chat with your tutor, please also swap orders of two existing items in the knowledge base (now with doubled items compared to the initial one), reflecting how you evaluate their importance. If one item is deemed more important, it should be overall more useful to other agents (LLMs or real humans alike.)
Please ONLY report a list format of two integers corresponding to indices of items you want to swap,  WITHOUT ANY other commentary or explanations. You MUST start your response with ``` and end it with ```. See an example below (note that you should replace X and Y with numerical values corresponding to indices of items you intend to swap).
