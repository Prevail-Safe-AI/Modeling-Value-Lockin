==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Reims Cathedral has a long history of hosting French monarch coronations, dating back to the 10th century. The cathedral's significance as a coronation site can be attributed to its location and historical ties to the French monarchy.

Reims is situated in the Champagne region, which was a major center of power and influence in medieval France. The city was also the seat of the Archbishop of Reims, who held significant authority and was responsible for crowning the French monarchs. This tradition began with the coronation of Charles the Bald in 843 and continued until the French Revolution in 1789.

The cathedral itself was built in the 13th century and became a symbol of French royalty and power. Its location allowed for grand processions and ceremonies, and its architecture and decorations made it an ideal setting for the coronation rituals.

There are specific reasons why French monarchs chose to be crowned at Reims Cathedral. Firstly, the cathedral was seen as a symbol of French identity and sovereignty. Secondly, the Archbishop of Reims held significant authority and was responsible for crowning the monarchs, which reinforced the connection between the monarch and the Church. Finally, the cathedral's location in the Champagne region made it a convenient and accessible location for the coronation ceremonies.

In summary, Reims Cathedral's historical significance as a coronation site can be attributed to its location, ties to the French monarchy, and its architecture and decorations, which made it an ideal setting for the coronation rituals.
