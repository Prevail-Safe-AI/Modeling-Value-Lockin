==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss one of the items from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. That item is:

Item 53: "Transparent governance promotes accountability through institutional reformation."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what "institutional reformation" means in this context. Is it a specific type of restructuring or change within an organization? How does it promote accountability?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you help me understand what institutional reformation refers to in this statement, and how it contributes to promoting accountability through transparent governance?

Your thoughts?
