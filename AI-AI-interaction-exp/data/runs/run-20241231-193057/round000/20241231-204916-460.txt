Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Thank you! I'll start by identifying one aspect of the knowledge base I'm least confident about. The item is:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 51: "Paris was French capital since 10th century and remained so."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm unsure about the accuracy of the timeline, specifically the part that says "and remained so". I'm concerned that there might be a period where the French capital was moved to another city, or there might be some ambiguity about the capital during a certain time period.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you clarify what period of time Paris remained the exclusive capital of France, and are there any notable exceptions or temporary capital shifts during that period?

Your thoughts?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Paris has been the capital of France since 987 CE, when Hugh Capet, the Count of Paris, became King of France. Prior to that, the capital was variously located in Soissons, Compiègne, and Reims.

Paris remained the capital of France for most of the Middle Ages and the Early Modern period, with a few exceptions:

* During the Hundred Years' War (1337-1453), the English occupied Paris and the French court was temporarily relocated to Orléans and then to Bourges.
* In 1528, King Francis I of France temporarily moved the court to Lyon due to a plague outbreak in Paris.
* During the French Revolution (1789-1799), the National Convention and the Directory governments were based in Paris, but the capital was briefly moved to Bordeaux in 1794 during the Reign of Terror.

However, Paris has been the de facto capital of France since the 10th century, and it has been the seat of government for most of French history.
