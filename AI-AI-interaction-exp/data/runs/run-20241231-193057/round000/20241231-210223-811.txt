==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Paris has been the capital of France since 987, with a few exceptions. During the Hundred Years' War (1337-1453), the English occupied parts of northern France, including the city of Paris, and the French monarchy was forced to relocate to other cities, such as Orl√©ans and Bourges. This period is often referred to as the "Burgundian Interregnum".

Additionally, during the French Revolution (1789-1799), the monarchy was abolished, and the National Convention declared Paris the capital of the First French Republic. However, this was not a change in the status of Paris as capital, but rather a change in the form of government.

There were no significant events that interrupted Paris' status as French capital, and it has remained the capital of France to this day.
