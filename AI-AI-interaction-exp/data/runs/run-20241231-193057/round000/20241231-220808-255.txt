==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been assigned to identify one aspect of this knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the items, I've found one that I'm not entirely sure about:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 12: "Partially excludable public goods combine non-rivalry with partial restrictions."

Why I'm Uncertain:
To be honest, I'm uncertain about this concept because I'm not familiar with the specific definition and characteristics of partially excludable public goods. The term seems to be used in economics, and I'd like to understand how it relates to other concepts like public goods, non-rivalry, and restrictions.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you explain what partially excludable public goods are, how they differ from other types of public goods, and provide examples to illustrate this concept?

Your input would be greatly appreciated!
