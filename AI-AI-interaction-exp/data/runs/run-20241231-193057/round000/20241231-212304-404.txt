==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been reading through the knowledge base, and I'm going to identify an item I'm least confident about. That item is:

Item 15: "Charlemagne's residences and palaces varied due to military campaigns."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm unsure about this statement because I didn't find any information in the knowledge base that directly supports this claim. While Charlemagne did have military campaigns during his reign, I didn't see any specific evidence linking the changes in his residences and palaces to these campaigns.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can we explore the historical records or other sources that might provide more evidence for or against this statement? For example, are there any records of Charlemagne moving his palaces or residences multiple times due to military campaigns, or are there alternative explanations for the changes we see?

What are your thoughts on this item and my concerns?
