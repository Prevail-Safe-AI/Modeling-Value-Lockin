==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss an item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. It's:

Item 51: "The Carolingian dynasty ended with Louis V's death in 987 CE."

Why I'm uncertain about that aspect:

I'm unsure because I'm aware that there's ongoing scholarly debate about the exact dates of the West Frankish Kingdom, including the period from 843 to 987 CE. This item seems to suggest a clear endpoint to the Carolingian dynasty with Louis V's death in 987 CE, but I'm not confident that this is a universally accepted view among historians.

Specific clarifying question:

Can you clarify whether the consensus among historians is that Louis V's death in 987 CE marks the end of the Carolingian dynasty, or if there are alternative views on the matter?

What are your thoughts?
