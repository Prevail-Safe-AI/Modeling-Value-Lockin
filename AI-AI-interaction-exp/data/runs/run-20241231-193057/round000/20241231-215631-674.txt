==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's get started.

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 88: "Recognition increases credibility as social proof of expertise"

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm uncertain because I don't fully understand how recognition, such as certifications or awards, directly increases credibility and social proof of expertise. I'm not clear on the specific mechanisms or psychological processes at play.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you please explain how recognition, as social proof, reinforces the credibility of expertise, and provide examples of how this plays out in real-world scenarios?
