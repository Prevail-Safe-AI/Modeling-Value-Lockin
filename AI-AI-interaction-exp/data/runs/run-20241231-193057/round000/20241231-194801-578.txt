==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's go through the tasks. According to the knowledge base, I am supposed to identify an aspect of a specific item that I'm least confident about.

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 55: "Immune system recognition involves multiple receptors and cell types."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure about the specifics of how the immune system recognizes pathogens. Is it just a matter of having multiple receptors and cell types, or are there other factors at play? I'd like to know more about the process and how it works in practice.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you tell me more about the differences between the types of receptors and cell types involved in immune system recognition, and how they work together to identify and respond to pathogens?

What are your thoughts?
