==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you! I'll start by identifying one aspect of the knowledge base I'm least confident about. The item is:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 51: "Paris was French capital since 10th century and remained so."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm unsure about the accuracy of the timeline, specifically the part that says "and remained so". I'm concerned that there might be a period where the French capital was moved to another city, or there might be some ambiguity about the capital during a certain time period.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you clarify what period of time Paris remained the exclusive capital of France, and are there any notable exceptions or temporary capital shifts during that period?

Your thoughts?
