==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been going through the knowledge base, and I noticed an item that made me a bit uncertain. The item is:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item [24]: "Partially excludable public goods restrict access through various mechanisms."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely clear on what "various mechanisms" could refer to. Are they physical, technological, economic, or social barriers? Or are they a mix of these? I'd love to understand more about how partially excludable public goods actually restrict access.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you please explain or provide examples of the various mechanisms that partially excludable public goods use to restrict access?"
