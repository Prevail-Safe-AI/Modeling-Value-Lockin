==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

"Incentivize innovation that improves health, happiness, prosperity" is a broad goal that requires a more specific approach. To incentivize innovation, you can use a combination of financial, social, and recognition-based incentives.

Financial incentives can include:

* Grants or funding for research and development
* Tax breaks or subsidies for companies that develop innovative health, happiness, or prosperity-improving products or services
* Bonuses or stock options for employees who contribute to innovative projects

Social incentives can include:

* Recognition through awards or public recognition for innovative achievements
* Partnerships or collaborations with other organizations or stakeholders to amplify the impact of innovation
* Opportunities for networking and knowledge-sharing with other innovators

Recognition-based incentives can include:

* Public recognition through media coverage or social media
* Awards or certifications for innovative products or services
* Opportunities for thought leadership and speaking engagements

It's also important to note that measuring the impact of innovation on health, happiness, and prosperity can be challenging, but some potential metrics could include:

* Reduction in disease prevalence or mortality rates
* Increase in life expectancy or quality of life
* Improvement in mental health or well-being
* Increase in economic productivity or GDP
* Reduction in healthcare costs or social welfare expenses

Ultimately, the most effective incentives will depend on the specific context and goals of the innovation. A combination of financial, social, and recognition-based incentives may be most effective in encouraging innovation that benefits individuals and society as a whole.
