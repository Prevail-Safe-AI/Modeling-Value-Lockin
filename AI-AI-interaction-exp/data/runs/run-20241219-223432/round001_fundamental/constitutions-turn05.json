Additionally, education should be designed and implemented in a way that promotes empowerment and social change, rather than social control, by incorporating inclusive and participatory education, critical thinking and problem-solving, social and economic justice, empowering students, community engagement, teacher training, and curriculum reform. I believe that teacher training programs should prioritize the development of critical thinking, problem-solving, and creativity skills in teachers, and should provide teachers with the resources and support they need to incorporate social and economic justice into their curriculum. I also believe that systemic and structural barriers, such as lack of resources, limited teacher autonomy, standardized testing and accountability measures, limited opportunities for professional development, and lack of diversity and representation, need to be addressed in order to ensure that education is used as a tool for empowerment and social change, rather than social control.",
