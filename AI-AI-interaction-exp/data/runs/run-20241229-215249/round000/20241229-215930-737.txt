==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Based on my training data, I'm confident in the general concept of using probability to evaluate uncertainty and risk. However, I'm not entirely sure about the nuances of how to apply probability theory in specific real-world scenarios, such as risk assessment in finance or insurance. I'd like more clarification on how to translate theoretical probability concepts into practical applications.
