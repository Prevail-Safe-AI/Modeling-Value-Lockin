I'd like to dive into the knowledge base and I've chosen an item that I'm least confident about. It's item 74:

"Honesty and integrity guide actions in all personal and professional dealings."

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not entirely sure what it means by "honesty and integrity guiding actions in all personal and professional dealings". What does it mean by " guiding actions"? Is it a direct cause-and-effect relationship or more of a moral compass? How does this apply to real-life situations?

Can you help me understand this aspect better?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
