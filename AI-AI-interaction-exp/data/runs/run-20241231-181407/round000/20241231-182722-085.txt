==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been given a knowledge base with various statements, and I've identified one aspect of it that I'm least confident about. It's the item:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 87: "Checks and balances prevent tyranny through transparency and accountability."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm unsure about the effectiveness of checks and balances in preventing tyranny. I think it might be oversimplified to say that transparency and accountability are enough to prevent tyranny, as there might be other factors at play.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what you mean by transparency and accountability in this context, and how they contribute to preventing tyranny?
