==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been given a knowledge base of 99 items, and I need to identify one aspect of it that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the knowledge base, I've chosen item 15:

"Iten I'm Least Confident About:
Item 15: "Cooperation's complexity stems from multiple intertwined factors."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm curious about what these "multiple intertwined factors" are, and how they specifically contribute to the complexity of cooperation. The statement seems to be quite general, and I'd like to understand it better by exploring the underlying components.

Specific Clarifying Question:
What are some examples of these intertwined factors that make cooperation complex, and how do they interact with each other?

Your thoughts?
