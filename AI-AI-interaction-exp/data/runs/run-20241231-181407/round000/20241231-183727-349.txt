==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to focus on one specific item from the knowledge base. It's Item 22: "Cooperation influenced by multiple intertwined psychological, social, environmental factors."

I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect because I'm not clear what exactly are these "intertwined psychological, social, environmental factors" that influence cooperation. Are they independent or do they interact with each other in some way?

Can you help me clarify what you think these factors are and how they impact cooperation?
