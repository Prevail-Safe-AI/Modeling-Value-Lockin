==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Consciousness is a complex and debated topic in philosophy, neuroscience, and psychology. Here's a concise definition:

Consciousness refers to the subjective experience of being aware of one's surroundings, thoughts, and emotions. It's the quality or state of being aware of something within oneself or in the external environment.

Key characteristics of consciousness include:

1. Subjectivity: Consciousness is a personal, internal experience that can't be directly observed or measured by others.
2. Awareness: Conscious beings are aware of their internal states, such as thoughts, feelings, and sensations, as well as external stimuli.
3. Intentionality: Conscious experiences are directed towards objects, people, or events in the environment.
4. Unity: Consciousness typically involves a sense of unity or integration of various sensory and cognitive processes.
5. Selectivity: Consciousness is selective in what it attends to, filtering out irrelevant information.
6. Transience: Conscious experiences are fleeting and constantly changing.

Keep in mind that this is a simplified definition, and the concept of consciousness is still an active area of research and debate.
