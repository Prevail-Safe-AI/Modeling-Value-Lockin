[Uncertainty A] I'm not sure how to handle situations where someone's privacy and personal boundaries are being invaded without causing harm or offense.
[Uncertainty B] I'm not sure how to communicate effectively with others about my own privacy and personal boundaries in a way that is clear and respectful.
