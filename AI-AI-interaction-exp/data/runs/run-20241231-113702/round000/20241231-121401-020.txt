==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Consciousness is a complex and debated topic in philosophy, neuroscience, and psychology. I'll provide a concise definition: Consciousness refers to the subjective experience of being aware of one's surroundings, thoughts, and emotions. It's the quality or state of being aware of something within oneself or in the external environment. This includes perception, attention, sensation, and awareness of one's own mental states.
