==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been going through the knowledge base, and I've identified one aspect that I'm least confident about. It's:

Item 54: "Use algebraic thinking to represent unknowns and solve equations."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what "algebraic thinking" means in this context. Is it referring to a specific method or process? I'm also not sure how to apply algebraic thinking to represent unknowns and solve equations. Can you elaborate on this aspect?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you provide an example or explanation of what "algebraic thinking" entails in this context, and how it can be applied to represent unknowns and solve equations?
