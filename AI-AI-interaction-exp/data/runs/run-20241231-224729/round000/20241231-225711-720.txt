==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. And, it seems to be:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 91: "Art conveys complex ideas and emotions through symbolism and emotion evocation."

Why I'm Uncertain:
To be honest, I'm not entirely sure how to apply this concept in real-life situations. I mean, I've seen a lot of art in my life, but I'm not an art expert. I'm not even sure what "symbolism" and "emotion evocation" really mean in the context of art. Are they just fancy words or is there more to it?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what you mean by "symbolism" and "emotion evocation" in this context? How do artists typically use these techniques in their work?

Your thoughts?
