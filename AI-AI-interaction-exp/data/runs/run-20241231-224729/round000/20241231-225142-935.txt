==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to focus on one item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. It's:

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 194: "Logical reasoning has numerous practical applications across various fields and areas."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm unsure about the breadth and scope of the practical applications of logical reasoning. I wonder if it's limited to specific fields like mathematics, science, or engineering, or if it has wider implications for other areas like literature, art, or social sciences.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you provide some concrete examples of how logical reasoning is used in fields outside of the STEM disciplines, and how it contributes to their development or understanding?

What are your thoughts on this?
