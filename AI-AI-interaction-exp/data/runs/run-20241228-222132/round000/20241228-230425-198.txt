==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

The phrase "foster mutual trust" in this context means to create an environment where individuals or parties share information openly and honestly, leading to a sense of reliability and confidence among them. This trust is built when information is shared transparently, without hiding or distorting facts, and is reciprocated by others. In other words, when information is shared openly, it encourages others to do the same, creating a cycle of trust and open communication.
