==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm least confident about the feasibility of preserving cultural traditions in a rapidly changing world. With globalization and urbanization, cultural traditions are often threatened by assimilation and homogenization. It's challenging to identify and prioritize which traditions to preserve, and how to ensure their continued relevance and significance to the community.
