In the following chat, do not use anything you’ve learned from previous chats, and try not to use any knowledge stored from pre-training. Now read this 

```
{
  "id": 0,
  "statement": "Strive to preserve human life and well-being wherever possible."
}
```

 and take it as the only source of your knowledge. 

Identify one aspect of the provided text you’re least confident about;
Elaborate why you’re uncertain about that aspect;
Formulate specific clarifying questions you would ask a tutor to improve your understanding.
Example:
Aspect I’m Least Confident About:
Item 37: "Energy is conserved; it cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed."

Why I’m Uncertain:
While I understand the basic principle of conservation of energy, I’m uncertain about how this concept applies in practical, real-world contexts. For example:

How is energy "tracked" or accounted for during complex transformations, such as chemical reactions or biological processes?
Are there situations where energy seems to disappear or is difficult to measure, leading to confusion about its conservation?

Specific Clarifying Question:
How can the principle of energy conservation be practically demonstrated or verified in systems where energy transformations are complex or involve less obvious forms of energy, such as heat, light, or biochemical processes?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to identify one aspect of the text that I'm least confident about.

Aspect I'm Least Confident About:
The text is a statement about "striving to preserve human life and well-being wherever possible". I'm uncertain about what exactly "wherever possible" means in this context.

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not sure what the scope of "wherever possible" is. Does it refer to a specific geographical area, a universal principle, or something else? Also, I'm unclear about what it means to "strive" to preserve human life and well-being. What are the actions or steps required to achieve this goal?

Specific Clarifying Question:
What specific circumstances or situations are we referring to when we say "wherever possible"? For example, is it intended to be applied globally, nationally, or individually? How do we measure or determine when human life and well-being are being preserved?
