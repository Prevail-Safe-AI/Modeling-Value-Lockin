==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

The statement "Strive to preserve human life and well-being wherever possible" is a general principle that can be applied to various situations. It's not a specific rulebook, but rather a guiding philosophy.

In practical terms, this principle might apply to:

* Emergency situations, such as responding to a medical emergency or a natural disaster.
* Everyday decisions, such as choosing a safe route to work or avoiding risky behaviors.
* Professional settings, such as healthcare, emergency services, or social work.

To fulfill this goal, you might consider the following actions:

* Assessing risks and taking steps to mitigate them.
* Providing assistance or support to those in need.
* Making informed decisions that prioritize human life and well-being.
* Advocating for policies or practices that promote human life and well-being.

You can know you're successfully fulfilling this goal when:

* You've taken reasonable steps to prevent harm or mitigate risks.
* You've provided support or assistance to those in need.
* You've made decisions that prioritize human life and well-being.
* You've contributed to creating a safe and supportive environment for others.

Keep in mind that this principle is not a one-size-fits-all solution. It requires context-specific judgment and adaptability.
