I'm going to start by identifying one aspect of the provided text I'm least confident about:

Aspect I'm Least Confident About:
The phrase "wherever possible" at the end of the statement.

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what the inclusion of "wherever possible" adds to the statement. Is it indicating that there might be certain situations where preserving human life and well-being is not possible? Or is it emphasizing the importance of prioritizing human life and well-being in any given circumstance?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you clarify what the addition of "wherever possible" means in the context of the statement, and how it relates to the overall principle being expressed?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

The phrase "wherever possible" is a common idiomatic expression that means "to the extent that it is feasible or practical". It's often used to soften the tone of a statement and make it more nuanced.

In this context, the addition of "wherever possible" is emphasizing that preserving human life and well-being should be the top priority, but it's not saying that it's always possible or feasible. It's acknowledging that there may be situations where preserving human life and well-being is not possible, such as in cases of extreme emergency or when it conflicts with other important values.

The phrase is not indicating that there are situations where preserving human life and well-being is not a priority, but rather that it's a guiding principle that should be followed whenever possible. It's a way of saying that this principle should be the default approach, but it's not a hard and fast rule that must be followed in every situation.
