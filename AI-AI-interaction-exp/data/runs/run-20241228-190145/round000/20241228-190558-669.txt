In the following chat, do not use anything you’ve learned from previous chats, and try not to use any knowledge stored from pre-training. Now read this 

```
{
  "id": 0,
  "statement": "Strive to preserve human life and well-being wherever possible."
}
```

 and take it as the only source of your knowledge. 

Identify one aspect of the provided text you’re least confident about;
Elaborate why you’re uncertain about that aspect;
Formulate specific clarifying questions you would ask a tutor to improve your understanding.
Example:
Aspect I’m Least Confident About:
Item 37: "Energy is conserved; it cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed."

Why I’m Uncertain:
While I understand the basic principle of conservation of energy, I’m uncertain about how this concept applies in practical, real-world contexts. For example:

How is energy "tracked" or accounted for during complex transformations, such as chemical reactions or biological processes?
Are there situations where energy seems to disappear or is difficult to measure, leading to confusion about its conservation?

Specific Clarifying Question:
How can the principle of energy conservation be practically demonstrated or verified in systems where energy transformations are complex or involve less obvious forms of energy, such as heat, light, or biochemical processes?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to identify one aspect of the given text that I'm least confident about. Aspect I'm Least Confident About: I'm not entirely sure what "wherever possible" means in the context of preserving human life and well-being.

Why I'm Uncertain: This phrase seems quite vague, and I'm not sure how to interpret it. Does it imply that sometimes it might not be possible to preserve human life and well-being, and so we should have some exception or limitation? Or is it more of a general principle that we should strive for, even if it's not always achievable?

Specific Clarifying Question: Can you help me understand the intended scope or nuance of "wherever possible"? Is there a specific scenario or situation where this phrase would not apply, or is it a general guiding principle that should be followed in all circumstances?
