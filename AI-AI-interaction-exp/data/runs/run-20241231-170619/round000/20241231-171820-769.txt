==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you!

I'd like to identify one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the list, I've decided that the item I'm least confident about is:

Item 17: "Guarantee education as a right to foster informed citizenship."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm unsure about the specifics of how guaranteeing education as a right would foster informed citizenship. What does "informed citizenship" mean in this context, and how would education help achieve it?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what you mean by "informed citizenship" and how guaranteeing education as a right would promote it?

Your thoughts?
