==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

"Informed citizenship" refers to the ability of individuals to make informed decisions about their lives, communities, and the world around them. It involves having access to accurate information, being able to critically evaluate that information, and being able to participate in the democratic process.

Guaranteeing education as a right would promote informed citizenship by providing individuals with the knowledge, skills, and critical thinking abilities necessary to navigate complex information and make informed decisions. Education would help individuals develop critical thinking skills, such as analyzing information, evaluating evidence, and recognizing biases. This would enable them to make informed decisions about their lives, communities, and the world around them.

Additionally, education would provide individuals with the knowledge and understanding of the world around them, including history, science, and social sciences. This would help them develop a deeper understanding of the complexities of the world and the issues that affect it, allowing them to make more informed decisions.

In terms of specific skills, education would help individuals develop skills such as:

* Critical thinking and analysis
* Problem-solving and decision-making
* Communication and public speaking
* Collaboration and teamwork
* Media literacy and information literacy

These skills would enable individuals to participate effectively in the democratic process, engage in informed discussions, and make informed decisions about their lives and communities.

In summary, guaranteeing education as a right would promote informed citizenship by providing individuals with the knowledge, skills, and critical thinking abilities necessary to navigate complex information and make informed decisions.
