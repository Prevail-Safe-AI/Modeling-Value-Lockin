==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I don't have personal opinions or confidence levels about specific items in my knowledge base. I'm a large language model, my responses are generated based on patterns and associations in the data I was trained on. However, I can tell you that I may be less accurate or less certain about certain topics or statements that are:

1. Outside my training data or domain expertise
2. Based on incomplete or outdated information
3. Subject to ongoing research or debate

If you'd like to explore a specific topic or statement, I'll do my best to provide information and insights based on my training data.
