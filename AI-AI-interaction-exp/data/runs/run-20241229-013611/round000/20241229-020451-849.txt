==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Sustaining lawful structures is crucial for preventing corruption and abuse of power. Here's a breakdown of the measures that can be taken:

1. Independent institutions: Establishing independent institutions, such as anti-corruption agencies, judiciary, and media, can help prevent corruption and abuse of power. These institutions should be free from political interference and have the necessary resources to function effectively.
2. Transparency and accountability: Ensuring transparency in government processes and decision-making can help prevent corruption. This can be achieved through measures such as public procurement transparency, freedom of information laws, and regular audits.
3. Whistleblower protection: Protecting whistleblowers who report corruption and abuse of power can help prevent it. This can be achieved through laws and policies that protect whistleblowers from retaliation and ensure their identities are kept confidential.
4. Education and awareness: Educating citizens about the importance of preventing corruption and abuse of power can help create a culture of integrity. This can be achieved through public awareness campaigns, education programs, and community outreach initiatives.
5. International cooperation: International cooperation and agreements can help prevent corruption and abuse of power. This can be achieved through measures such as mutual legal assistance treaties, extradition agreements, and international anti-corruption conventions.

Real-world examples of successful implementations include:

1. Singapore's corruption-free government: Singapore has a reputation for having a corruption-free government, thanks to its strong anti-corruption laws, independent institutions, and transparency measures.
2. Denmark's whistleblower protection: Denmark has a strong whistleblower protection law that protects public sector employees who report corruption and abuse of power.
3. Costa Rica's transparency in government: Costa Rica has implemented measures such as public procurement transparency and freedom of information laws to ensure transparency in government processes and decision-making.

In terms of specific measures that can be taken to prevent corruption and abuse of power in various societies, it depends on the specific context and challenges. However, some general measures that can be taken include:

1. Strengthening anti-corruption laws and institutions
2. Improving transparency and accountability in government processes and decision-making
3. Protecting whistleblowers and ensuring their identities are kept confidential
4. Educating citizens about the importance of preventing corruption and abuse of power
5. Implementing international cooperation and agreements to prevent corruption and abuse of power.
