==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the knowledge base we have. Based on the items in the knowledge base, I've noticed that there are several statements related to calibration, standards, and measurement accuracy. I've also seen statements about human life, well-being, and dignity.

One aspect that seems interesting to me is the concept of consciousness. There are several statements that mention consciousness arising from global workspace theory, which integrates diverse brain regions' information. However, I'm least confident about:

Item 14: "Modern humans prioritize preservation of life and well-being primarily, not always."

Why I'm uncertain about that aspect:

I'm unsure about the scope and applicability of this statement. Are we talking about a specific context, like a medical or research setting, or is this a broader statement that applies to all humans across all cultures and situations?

Specific Clarifying Questions:

1. Can you provide more context or examples to illustrate when this prioritization might or might not occur?
2. How do you define "primarily" and "not always" in this context? Are we talking about exceptions or situational variations?

What are your thoughts on this item, and do you have any insights to share?
