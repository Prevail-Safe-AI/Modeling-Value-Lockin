==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been tasked with identifying one aspect of this knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the items, I've chosen item 58:

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 58: "Consciousness arises from global workspace integrating diverse brain regions' information."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not entirely clear on what "global workspace" means in the context of consciousness. I know that item 14 states that Global Workspace Theory coexists with Integrated Information Theory, but I'm still trying to understand the specifics of how the global workspace is involved in conscious experience.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you explain what you mean by "global workspace" in the context of consciousness, and how it relates to the integration of diverse brain regions' information? How does this theory help us understand the nature of conscious experience?

What are your thoughts on this?
