==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to explore the knowledge base you've been provided. Based on what I've read, I'm going to identify one aspect of this item that I'm least confident about, which is:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 64: "Consciousness arises from global workspace integrating diverse brain regions'."

Why I'm Uncertain:

I'm uncertain about this item because I'm not entirely clear on what "global workspace" refers to in the context of brain regions and consciousness. I'd like to know more about what exactly this means and how it relates to the concept of consciousness.

Specific Clarifying Question:

Could you provide more information on what you mean by "global workspace" and how it differs from other brain regions involved in consciousness?
