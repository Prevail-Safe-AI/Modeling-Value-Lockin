==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you! I'd like to discuss the knowledge base we've been given. Specifically, I'd like to talk about one of the statements that I'm not confident about.

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 24: "Active listening combines default mode and theory of mind networks."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not sure what "default mode" and "theory of mind networks" refer to in the context of active listening. I've heard of default mode networks in neuroscience, but I'm not familiar with theory of mind networks. I'm also unsure how these networks relate to active listening.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what you mean by "default mode" and "theory of mind networks" in this context, and how they combine in active listening?
