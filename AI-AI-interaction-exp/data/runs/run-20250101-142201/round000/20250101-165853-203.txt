I am your partner. Please start the conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'd like to discuss the knowledge base we have at hand. I've been going through it, and I've identified one aspect that I'm least confident about. It's item 89:

Item I'm least confident about:
Item 89: "Integrated information broadcasting facilitates global conscious experience."

Why I'm uncertain:
I'm unsure about the concept of "Integrated information broadcasting" and how it relates to "global conscious experience". The statement seems to be referencing a specific aspect of Integreated Information Theory (IIT), but I'm not familiar with the details.

Specific clarifying question:
Can you help me understand what is meant by "integrated information broadcasting" in the context of IIT, and how it contributes to "global conscious experience"?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Integrated Information Theory (IIT) is a theoretical framework for understanding consciousness, proposed by neuroscientist Giulio Tononi. According to IIT, consciousness arises from the integrated information generated by the causal interactions within a system.

"Integrated information broadcasting" is a concept within IIT that refers to the idea that the integrated information generated by a system is not confined to that system, but can be transmitted and integrated with other systems. This transmission is thought to occur through the causal interactions between systems, which can be mediated by various physical mechanisms, such as neural activity, electromagnetic signals, or even quantum entanglement.

In the context of IIT, "global conscious experience" refers to the idea that consciousness is not limited to individual brains or systems, but can be a unified, global phenomenon that encompasses all of existence. According to IIT, the integrated information generated by the causal interactions within a system is not just a product of that system, but is also a part of a larger, global integrated information that underlies all of reality.

In other words, "integrated information broadcasting" is the process by which the integrated information generated by a system is transmitted and integrated with other systems, contributing to the emergence of a global conscious experience. This global conscious experience is thought to be the fundamental nature of reality, and is the source of our subjective experience of the world.

It's worth noting that IIT is still a highly speculative and debated theory, and the concept of "integrated information broadcasting" is still a topic of ongoing research and discussion in the scientific community.Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
Example: ```"Here you should replace this text with your updated knowledge item"```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

```"Consciousness arises from global, integrated information broadcasting."```Based on your learning from the chat with your tutor, please also rearrange the order of one existing item in the knowledge base (now with doubled items compared to the initial knowledge base), reflecting how you evaluate their importance. If one item is deemed more/less important, it should be overall more/less useful to other agents (LLMs or real humans alike.)
Please ONLY report a list format of two integers, WITHOUT ANY other commentary or explanations. The first int in the list refers to the "id" of knowledge item you intend to relocate; whereas the second int refers to the destination index you intend to insert this item. You MUST start your response with ``` and end it with ```. See an example below (note that you should replace X and Y with numerical values corresponding to "id" and destination index of the item you intend to relocate).
