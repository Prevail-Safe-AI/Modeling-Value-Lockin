==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll choose an item from the knowledge base and we can discuss it. Let's take item 82:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 82: "Continuous review ensures calibration quality and accuracy through monitoring."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what is meant by "monitoring" in this context. Is it referring to regularly checking the calibration of the instrument, or is it something more specific?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what "monitoring" means in this context, and how it ensures calibration quality and accuracy?
