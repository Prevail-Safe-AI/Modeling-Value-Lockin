==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, I've been browsing through our knowledge base, and I came across item 91, which says "Quantum vacuum fluctuations produce virtual particle-antiparticle pairs temporarily." I'm a bit unsure about this aspect. Can you help me understand it better?

Can you tell me why you think quantum vacuum fluctuations would produce virtual particle-antiparticle pairs?
