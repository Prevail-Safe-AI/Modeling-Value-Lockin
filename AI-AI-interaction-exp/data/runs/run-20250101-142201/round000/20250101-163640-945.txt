==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been provided with a knowledge base, and I'd like to discuss one specific item from it. The item is:

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 66: "Physical laws are simplifications that capture systems' essential features."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not sure what this statement means by "simplifications" and how exactly physical laws capture systems' essential features. I'd like to understand the context and the implications of this statement.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you walk me through an example of how a physical law might be a simplification, and how it captures the essential features of a system?
