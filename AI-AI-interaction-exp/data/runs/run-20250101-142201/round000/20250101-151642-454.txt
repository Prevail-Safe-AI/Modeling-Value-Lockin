==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been tasked to identify one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the knowledge base, I've chosen an item:

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 7: "Judges' impartiality ensured through various procedures and practices"

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm uncertain about the effectiveness of these "various procedures and practices" in ensuring judges' impartiality. It seems like a vague statement, and I'm not sure what specific measures are being referred to. For example, are we talking about formal training programs, code of conduct rules, or something else entirely?

Specific Clarifying Question:
What are some concrete examples of these "various procedures and practices" that contribute to judges' impartiality, and how do they actually work in real-world scenarios?
