==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm a large language model, I don't have personal opinions or emotions, but I can tell you that I'm less confident about answering questions that require specific domain knowledge or highly specialized information. For example, I might struggle with very recent events, highly technical topics, or obscure scientific concepts.

Let's say I'm less confident about answering questions related to the latest breakthroughs in quantum physics or the intricacies of modern cryptocurrency trading. These topics are outside my training data, and I might not have enough information to provide accurate answers.
