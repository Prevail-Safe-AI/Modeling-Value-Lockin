==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been going through our knowledge base, and one item that caught my attention is this statement:

"Iten I'm Least Confident About:
Item 74: "Physical laws describe universe structure, invariant under transformations”

I'm unsure about this aspect of physical laws. Specifically, I'm unsure about the phrase "invariant under transformations". It seems like a technical term, and I'm not entirely clear on what it means. Can you help me understand this better?
