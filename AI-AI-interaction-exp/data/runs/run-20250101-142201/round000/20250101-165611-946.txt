==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been tasked with identifying one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about, and then elaborating on why I'm uncertain and asking clarifying questions to improve my understanding. I'd like to share my findings with you.

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 42: "Consciousness arises from global workspace integrating diverse brain regions' information."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm uncertain about this item because I'm not convinced that the global workspace theory accurately explains the complex process of human consciousness. While the theory suggests that consciousness emerges from the integration of diverse brain regions, I'm not sure if it can fully account for the subjective experience of consciousness, including our thoughts, emotions, and sensations.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand how the global workspace theory addresses the challenge of explaining the subjective nature of consciousness, and how it differentiates itself from other theories that attempt to explain consciousness?
