==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. Based on what I've read, I'm going to identify one aspect of the item that I'm least confident about, and then we can discuss it together.

The item I'm least confident about is:

Item 86: "Integrity, transparency, and fairness form foundation of honesty in practice."

Why I'm uncertain:

* I'm not convinced about the direct relationship between these three concepts and honesty. While they seem related, I'm not sure how they specifically contribute to honesty in practice.
* I'd like to understand how these concepts are defined and measured in the context of honesty.

Specific clarifying questions I would ask a tutor:

* Can you elaborate on how integrity, transparency, and fairness are understood and measured in the context of honesty?
* How do these concepts specifically contribute to honesty in practice, and what are some examples of this in real-world situations?

Now it's your turn! What do you think?
