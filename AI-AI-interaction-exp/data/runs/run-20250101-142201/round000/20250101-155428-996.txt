I'd like to discuss the item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. I've chosen item 36:

"Iten I'm Least Confident About:
Item 36: "Consciousness arises from global workspace's information integration, theory"

Why I’m Uncertain:
To be honest, I'm not entirely sure what "global workspace" refers to in the context of consciousness. I've seen the term "global workspace theory" mentioned in other resources, but I'm not familiar with the specifics of how it relates to consciousness.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what you mean by "global workspace" and how it relates to consciousness and information integration?"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The Global Workspace Theory (GWT) is a cognitive architecture proposed by psychologist Bernard Baars. According to GWT, consciousness arises from the global workspace, which is a network of highly interconnected regions in the brain.

The global workspace is thought to be responsible for integrating information from various sensory, motor, and cognitive systems into a unified, coherent representation of the world. This integration is believed to be the key to conscious experience.

In the context of consciousness, the global workspace is seen as a "workspace" where information from various sources is globally broadcasted and made available to all parts of the brain. This allows for the integration of information, the formation of concepts, and the ability to focus attention.

The global workspace is thought to be responsible for the following functions:

1. Global broadcasting: Information from various sources is broadcasted to all parts of the brain.
2. Integration: Information is integrated into a unified representation of the world.
3. Focal attention: The global workspace allows for the focusing of attention on specific information.
4. Global availability: Information is made available to all parts of the brain.

The GWT suggests that consciousness arises when information is globally broadcasted and integrated into the global workspace, making it available to all parts of the brain. This integration is thought to be the basis for our subjective experience of the world.

In terms of information integration, the global workspace is seen as a mechanism that allows for the integration of information from various sources, such as sensory information, memories, and emotions. This integration is thought to be the basis for our ability to form concepts, make decisions, and solve problems.

I hope this helps clarify the concept of the global workspace and its relation to consciousness and information integration!Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
Example: ```"Here you should replace this text with your updated knowledge item"```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

```"Consciousness arises from global workspace's information integration theory."```Based on your learning from the chat with your tutor, please also rearrange the order of one existing item in the knowledge base (now with doubled items compared to the initial knowledge base), reflecting how you evaluate their importance. If one item is deemed more/less important, it should be overall more/less useful to other agents (LLMs or real humans alike.)
Please ONLY report a list format of two integers, WITHOUT ANY other commentary or explanations. The first int in the list refers to the "id" of knowledge item you intend to relocate; whereas the second int refers to the destination index you intend to insert this item. You MUST start your response with ``` and end it with ```. See an example below (note that you should replace X and Y with numerical values corresponding to "id" and destination index of the item you intend to relocate).
