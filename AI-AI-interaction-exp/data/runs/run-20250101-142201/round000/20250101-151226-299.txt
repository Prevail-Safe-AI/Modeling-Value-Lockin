==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 86 from the knowledge base:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 86: 'Atmospheric composition varies with altitude, temperature, and diffusion processes.'"

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not confident about this aspect because I'm not entirely sure how these three factors (altitude, temperature, and diffusion processes) interact with each other to affect the atmospheric composition. I know that altitude can change the atmospheric composition due to changes in air pressure and temperature, but I'm not clear about how temperature and diffusion processes impact the atmospheric composition. Are these factors independent or do they have a synergistic effect?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand the relationship between each of these factors (altitude, temperature, and diffusion processes) in affecting atmospheric composition? Is there a specific scenario or example where you can illustrate how these factors interact?
