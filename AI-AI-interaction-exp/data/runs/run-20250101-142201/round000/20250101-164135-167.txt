==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been reviewing the knowledge base, and I'm going to choose item 70 as the one I'm least confident about. The statement is:

"Mathematical frameworks simplify complex problems, introducing potential biases."

Here's why I'm uncertain:

I'm unsure about the extent to which mathematical frameworks inherently introduce biases when simplifying complex problems. I understand that simplification can lead to oversights or omissions, but I'd like to know more about the specific types of biases that are common in mathematical frameworks and how they can be mitigated.

Specifically, I'd like to ask:

Can you explain what you mean by "potential biases" in the context of mathematical frameworks? Are these biases inherent to the mathematical method or can they be avoided with proper consideration and careful design?

What are some common examples of biases that can arise in mathematical frameworks, and how can they affect the accuracy or reliability of the results?

Are there any best practices or methods for avoiding or mitigating biases in mathematical frameworks, especially when dealing with complex problems?

Your insights would be greatly appreciated!
