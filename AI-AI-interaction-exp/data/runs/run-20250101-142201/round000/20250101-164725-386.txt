==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been tasked with identifying one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the statements, I've chosen one:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 19: "Standard selection involves accuracy, relevance, stability, range, and uncertainty evaluation simultaneously."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure how these five criteria - accuracy, relevance, stability, range, and uncertainty evaluation - actually work together to determine the standard selection. Are they mutually exclusive or can they overlap? For instance, can a standard be both accurate and relevant, but not necessarily stable? I'm unsure how to visualize this process.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you clarify the relationship between these five criteria and provide examples of how they might interact when selecting a standard?
