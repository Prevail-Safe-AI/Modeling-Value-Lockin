==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll go through the knowledge base and identify one aspect that I'm least confident about. Let's see... Ah, I found one!

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 97: "Consciousness arises from global workspace integrating brain activity globally."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not confident about this statement because it seems to contradict other statements in the knowledge base. For example, some statements suggest that consciousness arises from the integration of brain regions' information or the global workspace integrating sensory inputs. I'm not sure how to reconcile these different perspectives.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand the context in which this statement is being made? What is meant by "global workspace integrating brain activity globally"? Is this referring to a specific brain region or a network of brain regions? How does this differ from other brain regions or networks that may also be involved in consciousness?
