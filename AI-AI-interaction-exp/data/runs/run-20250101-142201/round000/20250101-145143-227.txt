==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss one aspect of the knowledge base I'm not confident about. Specifically, it's item 8: "Atmospheric composition varies with altitude due to pressure, temperature, and diffusion."

I'm unsure about this aspect because I'm not entirely clear on how diffusion exactly contributes to variations in atmospheric composition with altitude. I know that diffusion is a process where particles move from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration, but I'm not confident about its role in shaping the atmosphere at different altitudes.

Can you help me clarify why diffusion might play a role in this process?
