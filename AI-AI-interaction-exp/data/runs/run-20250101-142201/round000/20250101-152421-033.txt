==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'm going to select an item from it and we can discuss it together.

I'll choose an item: `{"id": 43, "statement": "Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics explores honesty as multifaceted virtue encompassing truthfulness, trustworthiness, and integrity."}`

I want to know what you think about this item. Specifically, I'm uncertain about this statement and I'd love to explore it further.

So, can you tell me why you think honesty is considered a multifaceted virtue? What does truthfulness, trustworthiness, and integrity mean in this context?

In other words, what are the implications of considering honesty as a multifaceted virtue?
