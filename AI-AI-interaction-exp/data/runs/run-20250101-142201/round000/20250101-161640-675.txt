==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by asking you to identify one aspect of the knowledge base that you're least confident about.

Looking through the statements, one that caught my attention is:

{
"id": 29,
"statement": "Physical laws describe fundamental principles, not solely mathematical formulas."
}

I'm curious to know what you think about this statement. Are you unsure about whether physical laws are solely based on mathematical formulas or not?

So, please tell me which aspect you're least confident about and why.
