==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the knowledge base we have. I've been going through it, and I found an item that I'm least confident about. It's item 74: "Calibration involves thorough setup, environment control, and validation procedures."

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not entirely clear on what exactly "environment control" means in the context of calibration. Is it referring to controlling the temperature, humidity, or some other environmental factor that could affect the accuracy of the measurement? Or is it something else entirely?

Can you help me understand this better? Maybe clarify what's meant by "environment control" in calibration?
