==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been going through the knowledge base and I've identified one aspect that I'm least confident about, and it's Item 87: "Consciousness arises from global integration of brain information, IIT."

I'm unsure about this item because I don't fully understand what "IIT" stands for. Is it a specific theory or model that explains how consciousness arises from global integration of brain information?

Can you help me clarify what IIT refers to and how it relates to consciousness?
