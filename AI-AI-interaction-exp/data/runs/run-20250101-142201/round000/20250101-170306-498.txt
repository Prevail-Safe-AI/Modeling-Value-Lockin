==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start!

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 73: "Human dignity rooted in autonomy, moral agency, and inherent value."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not sure what specifically "inherent value" means in this context. Is it referring to an inherent value that humans have as a species, or is it something more abstract?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what "inherent value" means in this context, and how it relates to autonomy and moral agency in the concept of human dignity?
