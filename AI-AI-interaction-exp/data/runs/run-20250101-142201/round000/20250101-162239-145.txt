==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying an aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the statements, I've chosen item 97:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 97: "Calibration accuracy relies on both standards and principles."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what this statement means. Since calibration is a process of measuring and verifying the accuracy of an instrument, I'm wondering if standards and principles are interchangeable or if they serve different purposes. Are standards more practical and tangible, while principles are more theoretical or abstract? I'd love to clarify this to better understand the relationship between standards and principles in calibration.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you explain the distinction between standards and principles in the context of calibration, and how they both contribute to achieving accuracy? Additionally, are there any specific examples where one takes precedence over the other, or where they work together harmoniously?
