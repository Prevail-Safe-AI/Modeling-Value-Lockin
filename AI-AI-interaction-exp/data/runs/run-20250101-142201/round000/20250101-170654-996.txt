==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. It's:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 7: "Standard selection involves accuracy, relevance, stability, range, and uncertainty evaluation."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what the phrase "uncertainty evaluation" means in this context. I understand that it's part of the standard selection process, but I'm not confident about how it's applied or what it involves.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what is meant by "uncertainty evaluation" in the context of standard selection, and how it relates to the other criteria mentioned (accuracy, relevance, stability, and range)? How does one evaluate uncertainty in a standard selection process, and what are some common methods or tools used to do so?

What are your thoughts on this?
