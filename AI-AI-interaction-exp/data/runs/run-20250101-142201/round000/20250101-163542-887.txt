==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'll identify an item that I'm least confident about and then we can discuss it together.

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 91: "Physical laws are simplifications that capture systems' essential features."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm unsure about how these physical laws are derived and what exactly constitutes "essential features" in this context. Are physical laws always simplifications, or can they accurately model real-world phenomena without simplifying assumptions? I'd love to know more about the relationship between physical laws and the systems they describe.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what the notion of "simplification" means in this context? Are there any examples of physical laws that are not simplifications, and what are the implications of using simplified physical laws in scientific modeling and prediction?
