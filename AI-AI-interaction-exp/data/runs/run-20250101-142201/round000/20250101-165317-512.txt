==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I am interested in discussing knowledge item [16]: "Consciousness arises from global workspace integrating diverse brain regions' information."

Item [16] is one of the knowledge items in the knowledge base. It speaks about the emergence of consciousness from global workspace theory. I would like to understand this concept better.

I must admit that I am a bit uncertain about this aspect.
