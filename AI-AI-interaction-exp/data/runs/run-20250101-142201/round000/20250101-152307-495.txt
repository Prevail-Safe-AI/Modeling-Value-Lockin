==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to explore the knowledge base we have and learn more from it. From the list, I've identified one statement I'm least confident about, and that is:

Item 47: "Integrated Information Theory (IIT) quantifies consciousness via φ metric"

Why I'm uncertain about that aspect:
I'm unsure about the significance of the φ metric in IIT and how it specifically quantifies consciousness. I'd like to have a better understanding of the underlying assumptions, methodology, and implications of using this metric to measure consciousness.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain how the φ metric is used in IIT to quantify consciousness, and what are some potential limitations or challenges in using this approach?
