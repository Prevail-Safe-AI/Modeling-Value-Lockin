==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been reviewing the knowledge base, and I've chosen an item that I'm least confident about. It's item 38:

"Iten I'm Least Confident About:
Item 38: "Calibration refines through iteration with expert feedback and review."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure how the calibration process refines itself through iteration. What exactly does this mean? Is it through multiple rounds of calibration, or is it something more nuanced?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what is meant by "iteration" in the context of calibration refinement, and how expert feedback and review contribute to this process?"

What do you think? Can you help clarify my uncertainty?
