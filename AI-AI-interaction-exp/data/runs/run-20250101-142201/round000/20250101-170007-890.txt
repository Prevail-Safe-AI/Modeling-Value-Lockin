==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Actually, I'd like to tell you about the knowledge base I've been studying. It's vast and has a lot of interesting information. One item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about is:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 1: "Calibration preparation involves instrument setup, environment control, and verification."

Why I'm Uncertain:
To be honest, I'm not entirely sure what "instrument setup" and "environment control" exactly entail in the context of calibration preparation. I understand that calibration is a process of adjusting or setting a measuring instrument to ensure it's accurate and reliable, but I'm not clear on the specific steps involved.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what is meant by "instrument setup" in calibration preparation? Is it a specific process of configuring or configuring the instrument before calibration, or is it more related to the instrument's maintenance or tuning?
