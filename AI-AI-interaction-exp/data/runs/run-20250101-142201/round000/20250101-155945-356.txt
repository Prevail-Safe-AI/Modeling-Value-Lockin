==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm going to share an item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about, and I'd love to discuss it with you.

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 38: "Consciousness arises from integrating information in global workspace network."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm having a hard time understanding the concept of the "global workspace network" and how it relates to consciousness. I'm not sure if it's a widely accepted theory or if there's more nuance to it. Additionally, I don't fully grasp how integrating information in this network leads to conscious experience.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain the global workspace network and its role in consciousness? How does the integration of information in this network contribute to our conscious experience?

What do you think? Have any insights to share?
