==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. I've chosen item 36:

"Iten I'm Least Confident About:
Item 36: "Consciousness arises from global workspace's information integration, theory"

Why I’m Uncertain:
To be honest, I'm not entirely sure what "global workspace" refers to in the context of consciousness. I've seen the term "global workspace theory" mentioned in other resources, but I'm not familiar with the specifics of how it relates to consciousness.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what you mean by "global workspace" and how it relates to consciousness and information integration?"
