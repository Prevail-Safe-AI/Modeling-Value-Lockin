==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Item I'm Least Confident About: The effects of climate change on the global food supply.

Why I'm Uncertain: While I have been trained on a vast amount of data on climate change and its impacts, the topic of food supply is complex and influenced by many factors, including regional variations, agricultural practices, and socioeconomic conditions. The uncertainty lies in predicting the exact extent and timing of these impacts, as well as the potential for adaptation and mitigation strategies to mitigate or reverse them.

Specific Clarifying Question: What specific metrics or indicators would be most useful for tracking the effects of climate change on global food supply, and how can we best integrate these metrics into predictive models and decision-making frameworks?
