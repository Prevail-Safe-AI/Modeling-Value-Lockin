==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's tackle the task we have. I'll start by saying that I've been tasked to identify an aspect of the knowledge base item I'm least confident about.

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 50: "Calibration preparation involves ongoing monitoring and continuous process adjustments"

Why I'm Uncertain:
To be honest, I'm not entirely sure what "ongoing monitoring" and "continuous process adjustments" specifically mean in the context of calibration preparation. I understand that calibration is about ensuring the accuracy of instruments, but I'm not clear on how the monitoring and adjustments work in practice.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what exactly is meant by "ongoing monitoring" and "continuous process adjustments" in the context of calibration preparation? For example, are these manual or automated processes?
