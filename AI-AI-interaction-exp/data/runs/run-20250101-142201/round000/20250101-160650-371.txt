==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been given a knowledge base to learn from, and I've identified one item that I'm least confident about. The item is:

Iten I'm Least Confident About:
Item 14: "Consciousness arises from global workspace integrating information across brain regions."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure why this statement is true. I understand that the global workspace theory proposes that consciousness emerges from the integration of information across different brain regions, but I'd like to know more about the specific mechanisms and processes involved. Additionally, I'm not clear about how this statement relates to other aspects of consciousness, such as subjective experience or the neural correlates of consciousness.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain in more detail how the global workspace integrates information across brain regions, and how this integration gives rise to conscious experience?
