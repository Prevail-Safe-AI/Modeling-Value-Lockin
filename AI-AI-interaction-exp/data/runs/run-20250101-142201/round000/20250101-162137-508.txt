==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'll choose an item, and we can discuss it together.

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 88: "Calibration involves instrument setup, environment control, and validation procedures."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what the "environment control" aspect means in the context of calibration. Is it controlling temperature, humidity, or something else? Is it crucial for the calibration process?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what "environment control" entails in calibration, and how it impacts the calibration results?

Your turn!
