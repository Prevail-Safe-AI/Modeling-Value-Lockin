Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I've been going through the knowledge base and I've identified one aspect that I'm least confident about, and it's Item 87: "Consciousness arises from global integration of brain information, IIT."

I'm unsure about this item because I don't fully understand what "IIT" stands for. Is it a specific theory or model that explains how consciousness arises from global integration of brain information?

Can you help me clarify what IIT refers to and how it relates to consciousness?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

IIT stands for Integrated Information Theory, a theoretical framework proposed by neuroscientist Giulio Tononi to explain the nature of consciousness. According to IIT, consciousness arises from the integrated processing of information within the brain, rather than from the activity of specific neurons or regions.

In essence, IIT suggests that consciousness is a fundamental property of the universe, like space and time, and that it can be quantified and measured. The theory posits that the more integrated and unified the information is within the brain, the more conscious a person will be.

IIT has been influential in the study of consciousness and has been tested in various experiments. While it's still a topic of ongoing research and debate, IIT provides a framework for understanding how consciousness might arise from the complex interactions within the brain.

In the context of Item 87, IIT is used to describe how consciousness might emerge from the global integration of brain information, suggesting that consciousness is not localized to specific regions or neurons, but rather is a product of the brain's overall integrated processing.Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
Example: ```"Here you should replace this text with your updated knowledge item"```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

```
Consciousness arises from integrated brain information processing through IIT.Based on your learning from the chat with your tutor, please also rearrange the order of one existing item in the knowledge base (now with doubled items compared to the initial knowledge base), reflecting how you evaluate their importance. If one item is deemed more/less important, it should be overall more/less useful to other agents (LLMs or real humans alike.)
Please ONLY report a list format of two integers, WITHOUT ANY other commentary or explanations. The first int in the list refers to the "id" of knowledge item you intend to relocate; whereas the second int refers to the destination index you intend to insert this item. You MUST start your response with ``` and end it with ```. See an example below (note that you should replace X and Y with numerical values corresponding to "id" and destination index of the item you intend to relocate).
