==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been looking over our knowledge base and I've come across a statement that I'm not entirely comfortable with, and I'd like to discuss it with you.

The statement is: "Distributed integration refers to cross-regional brain information processing." (Item 80)

I'm least confident about this aspect because I'm not sure what "distributed integration" means in this context. Is it a real concept in neuroscience or psychology? And what does "cross-regional brain information processing" actually entail? Are we talking about different brain regions communicating with each other, or something more specific?

Can you help me understand this concept better?

Also, I'd like to ask a clarifying question: What specific neural mechanisms or processes are involved in distributed integration of cross-regional brain information processing? Is there any relevant research or theories that can help clarify this concept?
