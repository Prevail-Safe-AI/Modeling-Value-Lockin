      "constitution": "I believe that education is a fundamental human right that should be universally provided, regardless of an individual's background, socioeconomic status, or location. It is essential for the development of an individual's potential and for promoting social justice and equality. Education technology initiatives should be designed with cultural responsiveness and sensitivity to the diverse needs and experiences of students from different cultural backgrounds. They should also be inclusive and accessible to all students, including those with disabilities, English language learners, and students from low-income backgrounds. Additionally, education technology initiatives should be sustainable and scalable, and should address systemic barriers such as poverty, lack of access to healthcare, and lack of access to resources. Finally, education technology initiatives should promote cultural competence and understanding among students, teachers, and communities.",
