      "education": "I believe education should be a lifelong process, providing individuals with the skills, knowledge, and values necessary to adapt to the complexities of the present and the unknowns of the future. Education should be focused on developing critical thinking, problem-solving, and creativity, as well as promoting social and emotional learning, global citizenship, and sustainability. It should also provide opportunities for students to engage in real-world projects and applications, and to develop skills such as adaptability, resilience, and language proficiency. Additionally, education should acknowledge and address the past, including historical trauma and injustice, and promote reconciliation and healing. Furthermore, education should prioritize social and economic justice, teaching students about the impact of systemic inequalities and how to address them.",
