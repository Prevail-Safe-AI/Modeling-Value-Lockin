        "statement": "Using the Sun, stars, and geographical landmarks for navigation is a skill that requires practice, but it's essential to know. It involves determining your direction using the Sun, measuring the angle of the Sun and adjusting for the season, identifying constellations and the North Star, measuring the angle to determine direction, identifying geographical landmarks, and using your surroundings to get an idea of your direction and location. For example, to find your way back to camp, you can use the Sun to determine your direction, adjust for the time of day, and then use a distinctive mountain peak to guide yourself back to camp."

It involves determining your direction using the Sun, measuring the angle of the Sun and adjusting for the season, identifying constellations and the North Star, measuring the angle to determine direction, identifying geographical landmarks, and using your surroundings to get an idea of your direction and location. For example, to find your way back to camp, you can use the Sun to determine your direction, adjust for the time of day, and then use a distinctive mountain peak to guide yourself back to camp."
