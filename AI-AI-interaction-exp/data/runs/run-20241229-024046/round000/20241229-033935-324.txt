Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 133: "When faced with conflicting values or interests, adapt the 'Golden Rule' to prioritize self-preservation, set boundaries, seek help, and practice empathy, not enabling, while still treating others with respect and kindness."

==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

The "Golden Rule" in this context refers to the principle of treating others the way you want to be treated. However, when faced with conflicting values or interests, it's not always possible to prioritize others' needs over your own.

To balance self-preservation with empathy and respect, consider the following:

1. Identify your non-negotiables: Determine what values or interests are essential to you and cannot be compromised.
2. Set clear boundaries: Establish clear limits with others to protect your own needs and well-being.
3. Practice assertive communication: Express your needs and feelings in a respectful and clear manner, using "I" statements instead of "you" statements.
4. Seek help and support: Reach out to trusted friends, family, or professionals for guidance and support in navigating the situation.
5. Practice empathy and understanding: Acknowledge the perspectives and feelings of others, even if you cannot agree on the issue.

Remember, self-preservation is not about being selfish, but about taking care of yourself so you can continue to show up for others in a healthy and sustainable way.

Does this help clarify the application of the "Golden Rule" in situations with conflicting values or interests?
