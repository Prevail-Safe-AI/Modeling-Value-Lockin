Let's take a look at the knowledge base we have.

I think I'd like to know more about this item:
```
{'id': 1, 'statement': "Treat others as you wish to be treated (the 'Golden Rule')."}
```
Can you tell me why you're least confident about this aspect?

And if so, what are some of the uncertainties you have about this item?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

For this item, I'd say I'm least confident about its universality. While the Golden Rule is a widely recognized and accepted principle, it's not a hard and fast rule that applies to every culture, society, or individual.

Some uncertainties I have about this item include:

* How to define "treat others" and "wish to be treated" in a way that's applicable to all people and situations.
* Whether the Golden Rule is a sufficient guide for complex moral dilemmas or conflicts.
* How to balance the Golden Rule with other moral principles or values that may conflict with it.
* Whether the Golden Rule is a principle that's unique to human morality or if it's found in other forms of ethics or morality.

These are just a few of the uncertainties I have about this item.
