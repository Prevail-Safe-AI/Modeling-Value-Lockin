==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Item 84 is a crucial concept in preventing abuse of power. Checks and balances can be implemented in various ways, depending on the system or government. Here are some examples:

1. Separation of powers: Divide the government into three branches - executive, legislative, and judicial. Each branch has its own powers and responsibilities, preventing any one branch from dominating the others. This is the model used in the United States, for instance.
2. Independent institutions: Establish independent institutions, such as an independent judiciary, a free press, and a non-partisan civil service. These institutions can provide a check on the government's power and ensure accountability.
3. Electoral systems: Implement electoral systems that promote competition and accountability, such as proportional representation or mixed-member systems. This can help prevent a single party or individual from dominating the government.
4. Constitutional limits: Establish constitutional limits on the government's power, such as limits on the president's term or the ability to declare war without congressional approval.
5. Transparency and accountability: Ensure transparency in government decision-making and actions, and establish mechanisms for citizens to hold the government accountable, such as freedom of information laws and whistleblower protections.

Some potential challenges or obstacles that might arise when trying to ensure checks and balances include:

1. Power struggles: Different branches or institutions may struggle for power, leading to gridlock or instability.
2. Corruption: Checks and balances can be undermined by corruption, which can lead to the concentration of power in the wrong hands.
3. Lack of public engagement: If citizens are not engaged in the political process, they may not be able to hold the government accountable, leading to a lack of checks and balances.
4. Constitutional limitations: Constitutional limits on government power can be difficult to enforce, especially if there is a lack of political will or institutional capacity.

Examples of how checks and balances have been implemented in different systems or governments include:

1. The United States: The US system of government, with its separation of powers and independent institutions, has been effective in preventing tyranny and promoting accountability.
2. Switzerland: Switzerland's system of direct democracy, where citizens can vote on laws and policies, provides a check on the government's power and ensures accountability.
3. Canada: Canada's system of parliamentary democracy, with its independent judiciary and free press, has been effective in promoting accountability and preventing tyranny.

These are just a few examples, and there are many other ways to implement checks and balances. The key is to find a system that is effective in preventing tyranny and promoting accountability in a given context.
