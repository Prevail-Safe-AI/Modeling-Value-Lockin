==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Item 96 is referring to recognizing mental health as a crucial aspect of overall well-being, not just providing mental health care services. It's about acknowledging that mental health is just as important as physical health and taking steps to prioritize it.

Recognizing mental health as essential to overall well-being can manifest in various ways, such as:

* Practicing self-care and stress management techniques, like meditation, exercise, or journaling
* Building resilience by developing coping skills and learning to reframe challenges
* Encouraging open conversations about mental health and reducing stigma around mental illness
* Prioritizing sleep, nutrition, and physical activity to support mental well-being
* Creating a supportive environment that promotes mental health, such as a safe and inclusive community

In daily life, this might look like:

* Taking breaks and engaging in activities that bring joy and relaxation
* Setting realistic goals and boundaries to manage workload and stress
* Seeking support from friends, family, or mental health professionals when needed
* Engaging in activities that promote social connection and community building

In a community, recognizing mental health as essential to overall well-being might involve:

* Organizing events and workshops focused on mental health and wellness
* Providing access to mental health resources and services
* Encouraging open conversations about mental health and reducing stigma
* Creating a culture that values and prioritizes mental well-being

By recognizing mental health as essential to overall well-being, individuals and communities can take proactive steps to prioritize mental health and promote a culture of wellness and support.
