Specific Clarifying Question:
[What specific question would you ask a tutor to improve your understanding of this item]<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm least confident about this item because I'm not sure how to accurately use the Sun, stars, and geographical landmarks to navigate in different environments and conditions. For example, what if I'm in a dense forest with no visible landmarks, or what if the Sun is hidden by clouds? How would I adjust my navigation strategy in those situations?

Specific Clarifying Question: Can you provide more guidance on how to use the Sun, stars, and geographical landmarks in combination, and how to adapt my navigation approach to different environments and conditions?
