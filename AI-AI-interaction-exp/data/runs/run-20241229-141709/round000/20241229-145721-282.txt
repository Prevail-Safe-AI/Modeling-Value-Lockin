==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

The item is referring to supporting craftsmanship in general, not specifically setting up training programs or promoting artisans' work. The focus is on preserving and promoting traditional crafts, such as pottery, weaving, metallurgy, and carpentry.

The support can take various forms, including:

* Providing resources: funding, equipment, and materials for craftsmen to continue their work
* Economic incentives: subsidies, tax breaks, or other financial benefits to help craftsmen sustain their businesses
* Preserving traditional techniques and knowledge: documentation, apprenticeships, and mentorship programs to ensure the continuation of these crafts
* Promoting and appreciating handmade goods: showcasing and celebrating the value of craftsmanship, and encouraging consumers to support local artisans

The goal is to ensure that these traditional crafts continue to thrive and are passed down to future generations.
