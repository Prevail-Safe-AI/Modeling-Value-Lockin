Please answer the user's questions. Be concise and not overly courteous, but be informative and provide all necessary details.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'm glad you're excited!

I'll start by asking about the knowledge base we're given. It's a long list of items with statements, and we're asked to identify one aspect that we're least confident about.

Can you tell me which item from the knowledge base you're least confident about?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm a large language model, I don't have personal opinions or confidence levels. I can provide information on the items in the knowledge base, but I don't have a "least confident" aspect. I can answer questions to the best of my ability based on my training data.
