==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm a large language model, I don't have personal feelings or emotions, but I can tell you that I'm less confident in my ability to provide accurate and detailed information on very niche or specialized topics, such as highly technical scientific research or extremely specific historical events. I'm also less confident in my ability to understand and respond to idioms, sarcasm, and other forms of figurative language.
