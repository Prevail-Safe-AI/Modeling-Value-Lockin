Let's talk about the knowledge base. Specifically, I'd like to discuss Item 92: "Engage in regular exercise and maintain physical fitness."

I'm least confident about that aspect. I'm unsure about what constitutes "regular exercise" in this context. Is it a specific number of days or hours per week? Are there any age-related or health-related considerations that affect the definition of "regular exercise"?

Can you help me clarify this?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

The World Health Organization (WHO) defines regular exercise as at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity throughout the week, or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity throughout the week, or an equivalent combination of both.

For moderate-intensity exercise, examples include:

* Brisk walking
* Swimming
* Cycling
* Dancing

For vigorous-intensity exercise, examples include:

* Running
* Jumping rope
* High-intensity interval training (HIIT)
* Strength training with heavy weights

It's also important to note that the WHO recommends incorporating strength training exercises at least two times a week, targeting all major muscle groups.

Age and health-related considerations can affect the definition of regular exercise. For example:

* Older adults may need to start with shorter sessions and gradually increase duration and intensity.
* People with chronic health conditions, such as heart disease or diabetes, may need to consult with their healthcare provider to develop an exercise plan that's safe and effective for them.
* Pregnant or postpartum individuals may need to modify their exercise routine to accommodate their changing physical needs.

It's always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the best exercise plan for your individual needs and goals.
