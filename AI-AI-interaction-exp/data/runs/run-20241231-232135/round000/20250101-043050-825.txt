==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been reviewing our knowledge base, and I've identified one aspect that I'm not entirely confident about. It's Item 91:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 91: 'Data integrity involves interconnected accuracy, completeness, consistency, and timeliness aspects.'"

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm unsure about the extent of the interconnectedness between these different aspects of data integrity. I feel like it's not a straightforward connection between accuracy, completeness, consistency, and timeliness. There might be some nuances or specific situations where one aspect doesn't affect the others. I'd like to clarify how these aspects interact with each other.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain how these different aspects of data integrity interact with each other? Are there any specific scenarios or examples where one aspect might have a more significant impact than another?
