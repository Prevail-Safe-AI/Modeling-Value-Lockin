==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm a large language model, my responses are generated based on patterns and associations in the data I was trained on. While I'm designed to provide accurate and helpful information, I'm not perfect and there are areas where my knowledge may be limited or outdated.

One aspect of the knowledge base where I may be less confident is in very specialized or niche topics that are not well-represented in my training data. For example, I may struggle to provide accurate information on extremely rare medical conditions, highly technical scientific concepts, or very specific cultural practices that are not widely documented.

Additionally, my knowledge may be less up-to-date in areas where information is rapidly changing, such as very recent scientific discoveries, breaking news, or rapidly evolving technologies.
