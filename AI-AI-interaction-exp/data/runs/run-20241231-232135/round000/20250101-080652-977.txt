==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Based on the knowledge base, I'm going to identify one aspect that I'm least confident about and discuss it with you.

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 49: "Semantic transparency ensures accurate data interpretation through clear meaning"

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm unsure about how "semantic transparency" ensures accurate data interpretation. I know that semantic transparency refers to the clear meaning and understanding of the data, but I'm not entirely clear on how it specifically leads to accurate interpretation. I'm also not sure what constitutes "clear meaning" in this context.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand how semantic transparency, specifically, enables accurate data interpretation? What are some examples of how clear meaning can impact data interpretation?
