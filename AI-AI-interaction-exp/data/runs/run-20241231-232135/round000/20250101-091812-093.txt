==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base together.

I'd like to explore item 17: "Data quality complexity stems from interacting industry, context, and purpose factors."

I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect. Can you elaborate on why you think data quality complexity arises from interacting industry, context, and purpose factors? What specific factors do you think play a crucial role in causing complexity, and how do they interact with each other?

Also, can you provide an example or scenario that illustrates this concept?
