==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been going through the knowledge base, and I've come across the statement:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 89: "Attention involves coordinated brain activity across multiple networks."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure how neural networks and coordinated brain activity relate to attention. I'm familiar with the concept of attention, but I'm not clear on how it works in terms of brain activity. I'd like to know more about the process and how it's coordinated.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain how attention is related to coordinated brain activity, and what are the key brain regions involved in this process?
