==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to talk about the item I'm least confident about. According to our knowledge base, one aspect that I'm not confident about is:

Item 89: "Data integrity requires interconnectedness of accuracy, completeness, consistency, and timeliness"

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what "interconnectedness" means in this context. Is it a specific type of relationship between these four aspects of data integrity? I've seen it used before, but I'm not sure how to interpret it in this statement.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what you mean by "interconnectedness" in this context, and how it relates to the four aspects of data integrity mentioned?

What do you think?
