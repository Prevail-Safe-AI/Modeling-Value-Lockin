==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm glad to discuss! I've been going over the knowledge base, and I've identified one item that I'm least confident about. It's item 22:

"Data integration workflow involves profiling, validation, transformation, standardization, and aggregation."

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I want to understand the exact order and importance of these steps. I know that data integration is a complex process, and each step might have varying levels of priority depending on the specific scenario.

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm unsure about the optimal sequence of steps in the data integration workflow. Are these steps always performed in the same order, or can the order change depending on the situation?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain the typical sequence and importance of each step in the data integration workflow? Are there any scenarios where the order of steps might need to be adjusted, and if so, how would we determine the best approach?

What do you think? Am I on the right track?
