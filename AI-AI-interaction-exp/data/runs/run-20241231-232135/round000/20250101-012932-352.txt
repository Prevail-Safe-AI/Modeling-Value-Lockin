==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been going through the knowledge base, and I've identified an item that I'm least confident about. It's item 3: "Artificial intelligence enhances human cognition through diverse applications."

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not entirely clear on what "diverse applications" mean in the context of artificial intelligence. Are we talking about specific industries like healthcare, finance, or transportation? Or are we referring to different types of AI technologies, such as natural language processing, computer vision, or robotics?

I'd love to get a better understanding of what's meant by "diverse applications" and how they specifically enhance human cognition.

Can you elaborate on this aspect and help me understand it better?
