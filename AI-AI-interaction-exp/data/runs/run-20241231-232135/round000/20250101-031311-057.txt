==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by identifying one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. It's item 11:

"Iten I'm Least Confident About:
Item 11: "Feature dominance occurs when dominant features mask other features' importance."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what feature dominance means in this context. In machine learning, I've heard of feature engineering, but this term sounds a bit different. I'm also unsure about how dominant features can mask the importance of other features. Are there certain scenarios or examples that I should be aware of to better understand this concept?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you please provide an example or a scenario where we can see how feature dominance works in practice? For instance, maybe there's a dataset where some features are highly correlated with the target variable, but others have a significant impact only when combined with other features.
