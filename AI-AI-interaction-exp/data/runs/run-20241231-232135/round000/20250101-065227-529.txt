==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, we have a knowledge base of 99 items related to data integrity, harmonization, and preservation. I'd like to identify one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about.

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item [61]: "Data integrity ensured through redundancy, error-checking, and parity bits combination."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure how combining redundancy, error-checking, and parity bits ensures data integrity. I understand that redundancy adds extra copies of data to prevent loss, error-checking detects and corrects errors, and parity bits detect and correct single-bit errors. But what exactly happens when they're combined? Is it like a failsafe mechanism?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you explain how the combination of redundancy, error-checking, and parity bits works together to ensure data integrity? Are there specific scenarios or examples where this combination is particularly effective or inefficient?
