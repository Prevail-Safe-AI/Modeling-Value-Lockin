==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the item I'm least confident about, which is:

Item 95: "Standardization enables flexibility through reusable, modular frameworks."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what's meant by "reusable, modular frameworks" in the context of standardization. My understanding is that standardization typically involves establishing a common set of rules and definitions for a specific domain or industry. However, I'm not clear on how this would lead to flexibility or what kind of frameworks are being referred to.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what's meant by "reusable, modular frameworks" in relation to standardization, and provide some examples of how these frameworks might enable flexibility?
