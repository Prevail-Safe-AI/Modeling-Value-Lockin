==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been reviewing the knowledge base and I've identified one aspect that I'm least confident about. It's item 97:

"Standardization ensures data accuracy and consistency through predictable formats"

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not entirely clear on how standardization leads to predictable formats, and what kind of predictable formats are being referred to. Is it related to the structure of the data, the variables, or something else?

Can you help me clarify this further?
