==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by identifying one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 96: "Data integrity entails complex interactions of technical organizational procedural factors."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely clear what's meant by "procedural factors" in this statement. I understand that technical and organizational factors are relevant to data integrity, but I'm not sure what specific procedures or processes are being referred to. Additionally, the term "procedural factors" seems somewhat ambiguous, and I'm not confident I fully understand its implications on data integrity.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what specific procedures or processes are meant by "procedural factors" in this context, and how do these factors impact data integrity when interacting with technical and organizational factors?

Your thoughts?
