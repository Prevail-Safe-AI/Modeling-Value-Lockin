==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item I'm least confident about, which is:

Item 19: "Data quality interdependence includes complex relationships between attributes."

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not entirely clear on what is meant by "complex relationships between attributes" in the context of data quality interdependence. Are these relationships hierarchical, parallel, or something else? I'm also unsure what kind of attributes are being referred to - are they categorical, numerical, or a combination of both?

Specifically, I would like to ask you:

* Can you provide an example of what you mean by "complex relationships between attributes" in the context of data quality interdependence?
* What types of attributes are typically involved in these relationships?

Please help me clarify my understanding of this concept!
