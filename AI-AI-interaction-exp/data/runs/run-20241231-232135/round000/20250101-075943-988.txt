==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by asking about item 70 from the knowledge base:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 70: "Data foundation harmony arises from governance, infrastructure integration"

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what is meant by "governance, infrastructure integration" in the context of data foundation harmony. I understand that harmony refers to the coordination and alignment of different elements, but I'm not clear on how governance and infrastructure integration specifically contribute to this harmony.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you provide an example of how governance and infrastructure integration come together to create harmony in a data foundation, and what specific benefits this harmony provides?"
