==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm going to focus on a specific item from the knowledge base, and I'd like to get your thoughts on it. The item is:

Item 79: "Comprehensive data source documentation covers details and context invariably."

I'm least confident about this aspect. I'm uncertain because the word "invariably" seems strong, implying that comprehensive data source documentation always covers all details and context. But in my experience, documentation can be incomplete or missing details, especially in complex systems.

I'd like to ask a clarifying question: Can you explain what "invariably" means in this context, and how we can ensure that comprehensive data source documentation actually covers all details and context?
