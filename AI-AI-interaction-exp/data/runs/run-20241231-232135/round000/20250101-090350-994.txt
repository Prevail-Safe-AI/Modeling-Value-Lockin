==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss one of the items from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. It's item 45: "Data integrity involves multiple factors, beyond consistency alone."

Iten I'm Least Confident About:
Item 45: "Data integrity involves multiple factors, beyond consistency alone."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what "beyond consistency alone" means. In my understanding, consistency is a crucial aspect of data integrity. It seems to me that consistency is the foundation of data integrity, ensuring that the data is reliable and accurate. I'm not clear on what other factors are involved in data integrity.

Specific Clarifying Question:
What does "beyond consistency alone" mean in the context of data integrity? Are there specific factors or considerations that play a role in ensuring data integrity, beyond ensuring consistency?
