==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss one aspect from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. The item is:

Item 98: "Data quality encompasses accuracy, completeness, consistency, timeliness, and validity dimensions."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm unsure about what exactly is meant by "timeliness" as a dimension of data quality. Is it just referring to the fact that the data is up-to-date, or are there other aspects to it?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you please provide an example of what you mean by "timeliness" in the context of data quality? For instance, how does it differ from just having up-to-date data?
