==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm going to choose an item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about, and then ask some clarifying questions to improve my understanding.

Iten I'm Least Confident About:
Item 76: "Contextual factors determine data relevance, suitability in specific situations"

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure how to apply this statement in real-world scenarios. I'm wondering if it's a general rule that applies to all kinds of data, or if it's more specific to certain industries or purposes.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you give an example of a specific situation where contextual factors influence data relevance and suitability? For instance, in what kind of industry or domain would this be particularly important to consider?
