==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss one of the items from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. It's:

Item 98: "Data harmonization involves conversion, mapping, and normalization processes."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely clear on what is meant by "normalization processes" in the context of data harmonization. I understand that conversion and mapping are key aspects, but I'm unsure about the specific role of normalization and how it fits into the overall data harmonization process.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you help me understand what normalization processes involve, and how they differ from conversion and mapping in the context of data harmonization? Are there any specific examples or scenarios that would help illustrate the concept?
