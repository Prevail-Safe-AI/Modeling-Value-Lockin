==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been tasked with identifying one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about and elaborating on why I'm uncertain about it. After reviewing the knowledge base, I've chosen the item: 

Item I’m Least Confident About:
Item 7: "Quantum entanglement connects particles' properties through correlated states."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm a bit confused about how quantum entanglement actually works, and this statement seems too simplified. In my understanding, quantum entanglement is a complex phenomenon that arises from the mathematical structure of wave functions, specifically in quantum mechanics. The idea of correlated states seems to be a simplification, and I'm wondering if there's more to it. Also, I'm not sure how these correlated states exactly connect particles' properties.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you help me better understand how the concept of correlated states contributes to the phenomenon of quantum entanglement? Is there a more detailed explanation of the mathematical structure behind it?
