==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 43 from the knowledge base:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 43: "Data integrity involves interdependent quality, consistency, and timeliness factors."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm unsure how these three factors - quality, consistency, and timeliness - are interdependent in the context of data integrity. Are they mutually exclusive or do they complement each other in some way?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand how these factors interact and influence each other to ensure data integrity?"

Please feel free to elaborate on your understanding of these concepts!
