==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Based on the provided knowledge base, I'm tasked with identifying one aspect that I'm least confident about, and I've chosen item 39: "Data integrity ensured through harmonious balance of technical and procedural components."

I'm not entirely confident about this aspect because I'm not entirely clear on what a "harmonious balance" between technical and procedural components means in the context of data integrity. I'm not sure what specific technical and procedural components are being referred to, and how they interact with each other to ensure data integrity.

Can you help me understand this concept better?
