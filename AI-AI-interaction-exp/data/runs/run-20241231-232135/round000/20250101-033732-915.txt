==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to explore the knowledge base together. Let's start with one of the items that caught my attention, specifically Item 63:

"A structured data inventory catalogs organized data assets within an organization."

I'm least confident about this aspect because I'm not entirely sure what "structured data inventory" means or how it differs from a regular data inventory. Can you help me understand what this term refers to?

Please go ahead and elaborate on what you think a structured data inventory is and how it contributes to organizing data assets within an organization.
