==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, I've been reading through the knowledge base, and I've identified one item that I'm least confident about. It's item 74:

{
"id": 74,
"statement": "Data integration process's complexity requires nuanced approach and context."
}

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not entirely sure what is meant by "nuanced approach and context". What kind of nuances are we talking about? Is it related to the specific technologies or tools used in data integration, or is it more related to the business or organizational context in which data integration takes place?

Can you help me understand this better, and maybe provide some examples of what a "nuanced approach" would look like in practice?
