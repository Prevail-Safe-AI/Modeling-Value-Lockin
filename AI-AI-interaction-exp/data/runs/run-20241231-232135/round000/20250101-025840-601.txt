==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 94 from the knowledge base.

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 94: "Data discovery involves understanding data content and meaning."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure how "understanding data content and meaning" fits into the broader concept of data discovery. What does it mean exactly to understand data content and meaning?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what you mean by "data content and meaning" in the context of data discovery? Is it referring to the actual data values, or something more abstract like the context and interpretation of the data?
