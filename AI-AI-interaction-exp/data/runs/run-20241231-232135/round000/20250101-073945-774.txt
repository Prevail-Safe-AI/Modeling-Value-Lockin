==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start with the knowledge base we have, specifically the item we're discussing: `{ "id": 43, "statement": "Data integrity ensured through interplay of technical, organizational, and human factors" }`. 

I'm least confident about this item. I'd like to identify why I'm uncertain about it.

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 43: "Data integrity ensured through interplay of technical, organizational, and human factors"

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not sure how these three factors (technical, organizational, and human) interact with each other to ensure data integrity. I'm also unclear about the specific roles each factor plays in ensuring data integrity.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain how these three factors interplay with each other to ensure data integrity? What are some examples of how each factor contributes to data integrity?

Please let me know if you can provide any clarification or insights on this topic!
