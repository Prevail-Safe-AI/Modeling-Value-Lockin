==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Based on the knowledge base, I'd like to discuss Item 82:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 82: "Systemic and structural factors influence cultural competence through implicit biases."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm unsure about the direct connection between systemic and structural factors and implicit biases in shaping cultural competence. For instance, how do systemic and structural factors specifically contribute to the development of implicit biases, and how do these biases then impact cultural competence?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain the specific mechanisms by which systemic and structural factors, such as socioeconomic conditions, education, or workplace dynamics, lead to the formation of implicit biases, and how these biases subsequently influence cultural competence?"

What are your thoughts on this?
