==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm not uncertain about the statement. Data standardization does indeed establish common rules for data representation. This is crucial for ensuring consistency, accuracy, and interoperability across different systems, organizations, and industries. By standardizing data representation, it allows for easier data exchange, integration, and analysis, which is essential in today's data-driven world.
