==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm a large language model, my knowledge is based on my training data, and I don't have personal opinions or emotions. However, I can tell you that I'm least confident about very specific and nuanced topics that are outside my training data or are rapidly changing fields, such as extremely recent scientific discoveries or very specific technical details in a particular domain.
