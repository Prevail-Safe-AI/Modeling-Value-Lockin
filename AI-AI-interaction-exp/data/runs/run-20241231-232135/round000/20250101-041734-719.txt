==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 85 from the knowledge base:

"Iten I'm Least Confident About:
Item 85: "Digital signatures verify origin, source, and ownership through encryption, hashing, and public-key cryptography."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure how digital signatures can verify origin, source, and ownership through encryption, hashing, and public-key cryptography. I understand the general concept of digital signatures, but I'd like to know more about how these specific techniques are used for verification.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you explain how each of these techniques (encryption, hashing, public-key cryptography) contributes to the verification of origin, source, and ownership in a digital signature?
