==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I've been tasked to identify one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about and elaborate why I'm uncertain about it.

Based on the knowledge base, I'm least confident about the statement:

Item 64: "Standardization involves normalization, mapping, formatting, and data cleaning processes."

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not entirely sure what each of these terms means in the context of data standardization, specifically. Normalization, mapping, formatting, and data cleaning are all technical terms that might have slightly different meanings depending on the context.

Why I'm Uncertain:
* Normalization: Is it only about rescaling data to a consistent range, or does it involve more complex transformations?
* Mapping: Is it about creating a direct correlation between two data elements, or is it more nuanced?
* Formatting: Is it purely about presenting data in a consistent way, or does it involve more significant changes to the data structure?
* Data cleaning: Is it only about removing errors and inconsistencies, or does it involve more comprehensive data quality controls?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand the specific meaning of each of these terms in the context of data standardization, and provide examples or scenarios that illustrate how they're applied in real-world data processing? This would help me better comprehend the role of standardization in ensuring data consistency and quality.
