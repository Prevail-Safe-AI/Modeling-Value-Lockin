==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying the item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the statements, I've chosen item 86:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 86: "Consistency ensures uniform data through standard formats and practices"

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure how consistency ensures uniform data. I understand that standard formats and practices can help reduce errors and improve data accuracy, but I'm not clear on the direct connection between consistency and uniform data. Is it because consistent formatting and practices ensure that data is processed and stored in a uniform manner, making it easier to retrieve and analyze?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand the relationship between consistency and uniform data? How does consistency specifically ensure that data is uniform, and what are some examples of standard formats and practices that can help achieve consistency?
