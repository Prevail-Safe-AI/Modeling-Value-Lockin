==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thanks for being willing to chat.

I've gone through the knowledge base and I'm going to identify an item that I'm least confident about. It's:

Item 92: "Human judgment evaluates data trustworthiness by assessing credibility and context."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not sure how exactly human judgment assesses credibility and context to determine data trustworthiness. It seems like a subjective process, and I'm wondering if there are specific criteria or frameworks that are used to make these assessments.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what specific factors or considerations are taken into account when evaluating credibility and context in human judgment, and how do organizations or individuals make these assessments in practice?

Your thoughts?
