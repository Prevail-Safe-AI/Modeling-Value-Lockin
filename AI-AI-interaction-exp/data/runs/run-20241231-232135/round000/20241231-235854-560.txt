==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been looking at this knowledge base, and I have to say that one aspect that I'm least confident about is item 27:

Item 27: "Cultural competence adapts to context through nuanced understanding."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not sure what is meant by "nuanced understanding" in this context. Is it referring to a specific level of cultural knowledge or awareness? Also, I'm not entirely sure how this concept fits into the broader idea of cultural competence.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Would you clarify what you mean by "nuanced understanding" in this context, and also explain how it contributes to the development of cultural competence?
