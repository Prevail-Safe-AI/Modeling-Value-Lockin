==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'd like to identify one aspect of the item that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the knowledge base, I've identified the following item:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 91: "Structured data is organized and formatted for efficient retrieval"

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not entirely sure what it means by "efficient retrieval". Is it referring to data retrieval speed, data processing speed, or something else entirely? Also, I'm not confident about the precise definition of "structured data" in this context. Is it referring to a specific type of data organization or format?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you please provide an example of what you mean by "efficient retrieval" in the context of structured data? For instance, is it referring to reducing query times, improving data search capabilities, or streamlining data processing workflows?

Please let me know your thoughts!
