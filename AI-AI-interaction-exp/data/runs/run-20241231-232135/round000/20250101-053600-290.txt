==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to explore the knowledge base you provided earlier. One aspect that caught my attention is the statement: "Data recency, timeliness, and freshness ensure data accuracy and relevance." It's item #7 in the list.

I'm least confident about this aspect. My uncertainty arises from the fact that I'm not entirely clear about the distinction between recency, timeliness, and freshness. Are they interchangeable terms, or do they convey different concepts?

Can you help me understand this better? What are the key differences between these three terms, and how do they impact data accuracy and relevance?

Specifically, I'd like to ask:

* Are recency, timeliness, and freshness often used synonymously, or do they have distinct meanings in the context of data management?
* How do you define each of these terms, and what are the implications for data accuracy and relevance?

Your insights would be greatly appreciated!
