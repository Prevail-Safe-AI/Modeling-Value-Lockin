==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to know more about item 97 from the knowledge base:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 97: "Data quality complexity arises from industry, context, and purpose interactions."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure how these three factors (industry, context, and purpose) interact with each other to influence data quality complexity. It seems like a straightforward concept, but I'm not confident in my understanding of the nuances.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain how these three factors interact with each other in more detail? For example, how does the industry in which the data is being collected impact the context in which the data is being used, and how does that influence the purpose of the data collection in the first place?"
