==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's get started.

I've been looking at the knowledge base, and I'm least confident about item 38:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 38: "Artificial General Intelligence requires adaptive problem-solving capabilities."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure why adaptive problem-solving capabilities are required for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). I understand that AGI is supposed to mimic human intelligence, but I don't see the direct connection between adaptive problem-solving and AGI.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you please explain why adaptive problem-solving capabilities are a requirement for AGI? How does it relate to the human-like intelligence we're trying to replicate?
