==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I've been tasked with identifying one aspect of it that I'm least confident about.

After reviewing the knowledge base, I've chosen item 97:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 97: "Data integration involves preprocessing, fusion, normalization, and machine learning."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm uncertain about the order and importance of these steps in data integration. Are preprocessing and normalization compulsory before fusion, and does machine learning always follow?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand the typical workflow and hierarchy of these steps in data integration, and are there any exceptions or variations depending on the specific use case or dataset?"

What do you think?
