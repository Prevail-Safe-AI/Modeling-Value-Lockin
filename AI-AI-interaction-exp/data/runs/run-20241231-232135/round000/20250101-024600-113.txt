==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, based on the knowledge base we have, I'm going to choose one aspect of it that I'm least confident about.

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 16: "Data integration involves fusion, preprocessing, normalization, and machine learning."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what "preprocessing" refers to in the context of data integration. Is it a specific step in the data integration process? Is it related to data cleansing or data transformation?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you please explain what "preprocessing" means in the context of data integration, and how it fits into the overall process?

What do you think?
