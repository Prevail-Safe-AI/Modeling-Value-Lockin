==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, I've been going through the knowledge base, and I have to say that I'm a bit uncertain about Item 96: "Data discovery involves systematic identification and cataloging of assets."

I'm unsure about this aspect because I'm not entirely clear on what "systematic identification and cataloging" means in the context of data discovery. Is it just a simple matter of finding and organizing the data, or is there more to it?

Specifically, I'd love some clarification on what constitutes "systematic" in this context. What does it mean to do something in a systematic way when it comes to data discovery?

Can you help me understand this better?
