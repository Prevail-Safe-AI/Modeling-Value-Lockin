==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying the item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the items, I've chosen:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 34: "Data harmonization involves standardization, mapping, validation, and quality control processes."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm uncertain about this item because I'm not entirely clear on the specific role of each of these processes (standardization, mapping, validation, and quality control) in the data harmonization process. I understand that standardization is important for ensuring consistency, but I'm not sure how it fits in with the other processes.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on the relationship between these four processes and how they contribute to data harmonization, or provide an example of how they are used together in a real-world scenario?

What do you think?
