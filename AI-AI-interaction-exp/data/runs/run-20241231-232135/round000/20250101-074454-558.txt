==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to explore the knowledge base with you. I've been given a task to identify one aspect from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about.

Let me take a look... Ah, I've found one! Item 69 states: "Data trustworthiness arises from integrated consistency, accuracy, and completeness."

To be honest, I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect because... I'm not entirely sure how "integrated consistency, accuracy, and completeness" contribute to data trustworthiness. Can you help me understand why these three aspects are crucial for data trustworthiness?

And if you don't mind, I'd love to ask a clarifying question: How do these three aspects (consistency, accuracy, and completeness) work together to create trustworthiness in data?
