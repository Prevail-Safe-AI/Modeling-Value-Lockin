==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the knowledge base we have. Based on this vast amount of information, I've identified one aspect that I'm least confident about, and I'd like to clarify my understanding.

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 27: "Standardization provides framework, but doesn't guarantee data accuracy."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely convinced about the relationship between standardization and data accuracy. Does standardization only provide a framework, whereas data accuracy is not ensured? Or is standardization itself a step that can guarantee data accuracy? I'm unclear about the extent to which standardization plays a role in ensuring data accuracy.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you please elaborate on how standardization, in this context, affects data accuracy? What are the limitations of standardization in ensuring data accuracy, if any? How can we enhance data accuracy beyond standardization?
