==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. Based on what I've learned, I'm going to choose an item that I'm least confident about. The item is:

Item 49: "Data integrity ensures internal consistency and validity through normalization, validation, cleansing, and governance."

I'm unsure about this item because I'm not entirely clear on what exactly normalization, validation, cleansing, and governance are in the context of data integrity. I understand that data integrity focuses on ensuring the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of data, but I'm not sure how these four specific concepts fit into the bigger picture.

Can you help me understand what each of these concepts means in the context of data integrity, and how they work together to ensure data integrity?
