==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. And that is:

Item 11: "Systems efficiency metrics measure performance, resource usage, and cost."

I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect because I'm not entirely clear on how these three elements - performance, resource usage, and cost - are typically measured and weighted when evaluating systems efficiency. Are there any specific metrics or frameworks that are commonly used to assess these factors? Are they given equal importance, or is one more critical than the others?

Specifically, I'd love to know more about what "resource usage" entails, and how it's quantified in this context. Is it referring to financial resources, human resources, or something else entirely?

Can you help shed some light on this for me?
