==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by saying that I've been reviewing our knowledge base, and I've come across an item that I'm least confident about. The item is:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 86: "Standardized frameworks ensure consistent data management through policies and procedures"

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not sure how standardized frameworks actually ensure consistent data management. I understand that standardized frameworks are important for data consistency, but I'm not confident in my understanding of how they specifically achieve this.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand how standardized frameworks, such as policies and procedures, actually ensure consistent data management? What specific mechanisms or processes are used to achieve this consistency?

What are your thoughts?
