==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've chosen an item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about, and I'll share it with you. The item is:

Item 22: "Data integration involves thoughtful consideration of multiple complex factors"

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what exactly these complex factors are or how they impact the data integration process. The statement sounds quite general, and I'd like a more concrete understanding of what it means.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what some of these complex factors are, and how they are considered in the data integration process? Are there any specific tools or methods that are commonly used to handle these complexities?
