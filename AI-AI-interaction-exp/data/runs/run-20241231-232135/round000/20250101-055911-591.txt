==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss one of the items from the knowledge base, specifically item #52:

"{ id: 52, statement: "MACs verify integrity, digital signatures verify sender and integrity." }"

I'm not extremely confident about this aspect, and I'd like to discuss it with you. Could you help me understand why MACs verify integrity and digital signatures verify sender and integrity? What are the implications of each verification process?
