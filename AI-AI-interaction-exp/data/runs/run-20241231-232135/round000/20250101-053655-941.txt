==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to choose an item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about and explore it further.

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 74: "Data origin verification involves digital signatures and timestamps combination."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not sure why this specific combination of digital signatures and timestamps is necessary for data origin verification. Are digital signatures alone sufficient for verification? What role do timestamps play in ensuring data origin?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain why the combination of digital signatures and timestamps is used for data origin verification, rather than just one or the other?
