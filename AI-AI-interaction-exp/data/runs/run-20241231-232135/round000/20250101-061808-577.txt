==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the knowledge base, I've chosen item 36:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 36: "Data harmonization involves standardization, mapping, validation, and quality control."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what "mapping" entails in the context of data harmonization. Is it a specific process or technique used to convert data from one format to another? Or is it something more general, like creating a connection between different data sources?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you elaborate on what "mapping" refers to in the context of data harmonization? Is it a particular method or tool used to ensure data consistency across different systems or formats?
