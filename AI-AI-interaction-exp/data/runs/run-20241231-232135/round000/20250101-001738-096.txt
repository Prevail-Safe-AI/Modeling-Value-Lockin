==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you! I'd like to discuss the knowledge base we have, and I'd like to identify one aspect of it that I'm least confident about.

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 33: "Active listening balances focus, empathy, and nonverbal cues dynamically."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what "balancing" means in this context. Is it a literal balance between focus, empathy, and nonverbal cues, or is it more of a metaphorical balance? Also, I'm not confident about what "dynamically" implies in this statement.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you please explain what "balancing" and "dynamically" mean in this context? How does active listening achieve this balance?
