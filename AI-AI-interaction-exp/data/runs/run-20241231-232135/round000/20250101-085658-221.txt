==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I can help you with that. Since I'm a large language model, I don't have direct access to your knowledge base. However, I can ask you some questions to help identify an area where you might want to focus.

Can you tell me what kind of topics or areas you've been working on recently? Are there any specific domains or subjects that you're struggling to understand or remember?
