==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been reviewing the knowledge base, and one item that caught my attention is the statement: "Self-awareness is crucial for effective cross-cultural communication." It's item 93.

I'm actually least confident about this aspect because I'm not entirely sure how exactly self-awareness contributes to effective cross-cultural communication. What specifically makes self-awareness crucial in this context? Is it because it helps individuals understand their own biases and cultural lenses, or is it something else entirely?

Would love to get your thoughts on this!
