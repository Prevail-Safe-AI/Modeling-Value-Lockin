==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by saying that I've been tasked to identify a specific aspect of this item from the knowledge base I'm least confident about. After reviewing the item, I've chosen:

Item I’m Least Confident About:
Item 87: "Cognitive biases distort abstract concept generalization through information processing errors."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm unsure about the relationship between cognitive biases, abstract concept generalization, and information processing errors. What exactly does it mean to generalize abstract concepts, and how do cognitive biases play a role in this process? How do information processing errors fit into this scenario?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain the concept of abstract concept generalization and how cognitive biases can distort it, and could you provide an example of an information processing error that might occur in this context?

What do you think? Can you help clarify this concept for me?
