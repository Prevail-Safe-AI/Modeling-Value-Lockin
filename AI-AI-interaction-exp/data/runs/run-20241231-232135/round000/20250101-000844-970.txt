==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to explore one item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. Specifically, it's:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 41: "Cultural competence evolves through self-awareness, continuous learning, and reflective practice."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm unclear about what "reflective practice" means in this context. Is it a specific technique for developing cultural competence, or is it a general concept that encompasses self-awareness and continuous learning? Additionally, I'm not sure how these three components interact or build upon each other to enable cultural competence.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what you mean by "reflective practice" in the context of cultural competence, and how it relates to self-awareness and continuous learning?
