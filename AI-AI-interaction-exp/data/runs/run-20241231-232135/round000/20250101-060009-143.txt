==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been looking through the knowledge base, and I've identified one aspect that I'm least confident about. It's this item:

Item 99: "Standardization enables clear communication through shared vocabulary and rules."

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not entirely convinced that standardization is the sole enabler of clear communication. I think there might be other factors at play, such as cultural context, personal characteristics, or individual experiences. Don't you think that standardization is just one part of the equation?

Can you help me clarify this?
