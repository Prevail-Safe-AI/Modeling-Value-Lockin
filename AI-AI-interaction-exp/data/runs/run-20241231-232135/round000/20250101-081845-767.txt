==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to identify one aspect from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about and discuss it with you.

After reviewing the knowledge base, I've identified item 79 as something I'm not confident about:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 79: "Governance integration enables consistent data management through standardization."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm unsure how standardization specifically leads to consistent data management. Is it just about formatting and presentation, or is there more to it? I'd like to understand the relationship between governance integration and standardization in terms of data management.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you explain how standardization enables consistent data management, beyond just formatting and presentation? What specific mechanisms or processes are at play?

What are your thoughts on this?
