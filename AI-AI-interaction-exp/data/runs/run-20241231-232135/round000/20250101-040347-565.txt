==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by saying that I've been going through the knowledge base and I've come across item 59, which states that "Data discovery involves structured identification, classification, and documentation."

I have to admit that I'm least confident about this aspect. I'm not entirely sure what constitutes a "structured" approach to data discovery, and how it differs from an unstructured one.

Could you elaborate on what you think "structured" means in this context?
