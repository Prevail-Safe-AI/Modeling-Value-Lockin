==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. Based on what I've read, I've identified one item that I'm least confident about:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 44: "Cultural competence develops through adaptive cross-cultural interactions."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm wondering if this statement is too broad or vague. What exactly does "adaptive cross-cultural interactions" mean? Are we talking about individual interactions between people from different cultures, or is it more about systemic or organizational adaptations?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what's meant by "adaptive cross-cultural interactions" in this context? Are there any specific examples or scenarios where this concept would apply?
