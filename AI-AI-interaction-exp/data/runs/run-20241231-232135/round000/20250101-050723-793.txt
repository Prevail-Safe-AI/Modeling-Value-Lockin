==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying one aspect of this knowledge base that I'm least confident about. The item is:

Item 72: "Data integrity arises from interconnected accuracy, completeness, security, consistency principles"

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not entirely clear on what it means for data integrity to "arise" from interconnected principles. What do you think this statement is trying to convey?

Can you help me clarify my understanding of this concept?
