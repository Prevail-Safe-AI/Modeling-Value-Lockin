==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss an item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. The item is:

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 75: "Automated data checks can be imperfect due to complexity."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what "complexity" refers to in this context. Is it the complexity of the data itself, the algorithms used in the automated checks, or something else?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what you mean by "complexity" in this statement, and provide an example of when automated data checks might be imperfect due to complexity?
