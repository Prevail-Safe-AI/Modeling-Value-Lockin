==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to explore our knowledge base together. I want to identify one aspect that I'm least confident about. Let's start with item 87:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 87: "Standardization ensures consistency, while validation ensures data accuracy."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm wondering if standardization only ensures consistency in terms of data formatting, and not necessarily ensures that the data is accurate. And what exactly does "validation ensures data accuracy" mean? Is it that validation checks for errors and inconsistencies, or does it ensure that the data is correct in the first place?

Specific Clarifying Question:
What is the relationship between standardization and validation in ensuring data integrity? Does standardization help validate data accuracy, or are they two separate concepts?
