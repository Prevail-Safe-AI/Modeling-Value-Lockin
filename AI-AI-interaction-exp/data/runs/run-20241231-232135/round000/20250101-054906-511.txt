==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Based on the knowledge base, I've identified one aspect that I'm least confident about, and that is:

Item 20: "Data quality factors combined through harmonious balance and consistency."

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not clear on what exactly "harmonious balance" means in the context of data quality. Is it a specific ratio or proportion of accuracy, completeness, and reliability that data quality factors need to be in for it to be considered harmonious? Or is it something more abstract, like a balance that's achieved through some sort of compromise or trade-off?

So, my question is:

Can you clarify what you mean by "harmonious balance" in the context of data quality, and how it relates to the combination of data quality factors?
