==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll go ahead and choose an item from the knowledge base and we can discuss it.

I've chosen item 51, which is:
{
"id": 51,
"statement": "Hormone imbalances result from interplay of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors."
}

I'm a bit uncertain about this item. I understand that hormone imbalances can be caused by multiple factors, but I'm not entirely sure how these factors interact with each other to produce an imbalance.

Can you help me understand this better?

Why do you think hormone imbalances result from an interplay of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors? Do you think there's a specific level of influence from each of these factors, or is it more complex than that?
