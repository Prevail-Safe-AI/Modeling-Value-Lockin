==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the knowledge base we have. Specifically, I'd like to identify one aspect that I'm least confident about.

Let me take a look at the knowledge base... Ah, I think I've found one. I'm least confident about Item 62:

"Iten 62: Quantum entanglement represents correlated wave functions in mathematical equations."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what "correlated wave functions" mean in the context of quantum entanglement. I understand that entanglement is a phenomenon where particles become connected and can affect each other, but I'm not clear how wave functions fit into this picture.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what "correlated wave functions" mean in the context of quantum entanglement? How do these wave functions relate to the connectedness of particles?
