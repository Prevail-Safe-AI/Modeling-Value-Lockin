==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been reviewing the knowledge base, and I'd like to identify one aspect that I'm least confident about. For me, it's item 74:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 74: "Data trustworthiness stems from accuracy, completeness, and consistency directly"

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure if data trustworthiness is solely dependent on accuracy, completeness, and consistency. Don't we need to consider other factors as well, such as data authenticity, freshness, and relevance? I'd like to understand the context behind this statement and how it applies to real-world scenarios.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what the authors mean by "directly" and whether they're implying that accuracy, completeness, and consistency are the only factors contributing to data trustworthiness?"
