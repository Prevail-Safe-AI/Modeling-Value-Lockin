==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I've been reading through it, and one item that I'm least confident about is the following:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 84: "Data profiling analyzes data characteristics for structure, content, and relationships"

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what data profiling is or what it entails. Is it a specific technique or process used to analyze data? Are there specific tools or methods used for data profiling?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what data profiling is and how it's used to analyze data characteristics? Can you also give an example of when data profiling would be particularly useful?
