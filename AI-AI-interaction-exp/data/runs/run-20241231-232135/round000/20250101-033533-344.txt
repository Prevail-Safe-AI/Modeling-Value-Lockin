==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been reviewing the knowledge base, and I'd like to discuss item 3:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 3: "Data mapping is crucial for identifying and addressing data inconsistencies."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm uncertain about the scope of data mapping in identifying and addressing data inconsistencies. Is data mapping only limited to identifying inconsistencies or does it also involve resolving them? Should data mapping be a separate step from data quality assessment, or is it an integrative process?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you clarify the role of data mapping in identifying and addressing data inconsistencies? Is data mapping a one-time step or an ongoing process?"

What's your take on this?
