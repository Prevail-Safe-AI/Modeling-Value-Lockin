==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by saying that I'm going to ask you about an item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about, and then I'll explain why I'm uncertain about it and ask some clarifying questions.

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 93: "Cultural competence emerges from internal-external complex factor interactions."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm unsure about this because the phrase "internal-external complex factor interactions" seems a bit vague and unclear. I'm not entirely confident about what kind of internal and external factors are being referred to, or how they interact in the context of cultural competence.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what specific internal and external factors are being referred to in this statement, and how they interact to influence cultural competence? For example, are internal factors like personal values and beliefs, and external factors like societal norms and expectations?

Please let me know your thoughts!
