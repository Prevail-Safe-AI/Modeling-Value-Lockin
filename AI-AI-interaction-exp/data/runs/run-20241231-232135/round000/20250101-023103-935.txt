==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, I've been reviewing the knowledge base, and I noticed that there are both statements about data integration and quantum entanglement. I'm going to focus on the item that's making me least confident:

"This item is: `{ "id": 60, "statement": "Correlated wave functions describe entangled particles' quantum connection mathematically." }`

I'm not sure what it means.

Why I'm uncertain: I don't understand what "correlated wave functions" are, and how they relate to entangled particles. It seems like a complex topic in physics.

Specific Clarifying Question: Can you explain what "correlated wave functions" are, and how they contribute to understanding quantum entanglement?
