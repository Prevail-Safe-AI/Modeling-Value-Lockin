==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been going through the knowledge base, and I'm trying to identify one aspect that I'm least confident about. I've chosen item 56, which states:

Item 56: "Structured reflection involves intentional examination and analysis of experience."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what this means by "intentional examination and analysis of experience". Is it referring to a specific technique or method for reflecting on one's experiences? Are there any specific cognitive or emotional processes involved in this type of reflection? 

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand better what is meant by "intentional examination and analysis of experience"? What are some possible examples of how this might be applied in real-life situations?
