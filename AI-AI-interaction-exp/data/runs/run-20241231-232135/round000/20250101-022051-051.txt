==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by saying that I was asked to identify one aspect from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. And the item I chose is:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 11: "Data integration combines multiple process steps harmoniously with tools."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what "harmoniously" means in this context. I understand that data integration involves preprocessing, normalization, and fusion, but I'm not confident about what "harmoniously" adds to the process. Is it a specific tool or a method that ensures a smooth integration?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what you mean by "harmoniously" in the context of data integration, and how does it differ from just combining multiple process steps?
