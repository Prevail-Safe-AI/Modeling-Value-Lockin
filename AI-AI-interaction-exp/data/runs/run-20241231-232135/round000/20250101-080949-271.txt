==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 21 from the knowledge base:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 21: "Data foundation embodies infrastructure, processes, and policies harmoniously."

Why I’m Uncertain:
Honestly, I'm not entirely sure what "embodies" means in this context. I understand that a data foundation includes infrastructure, processes, and policies, but the word "embodies" seems to imply a more profound or intrinsic connection between these components. I'm not confident that I fully grasp the meaning of this statement.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what "embodies" means in this context? Does it imply a tight integration or a more loose coupling between the different components of the data foundation?"
