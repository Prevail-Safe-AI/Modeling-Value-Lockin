==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been tasked to identify one aspect from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the items, I've chosen item 93:

Item 93: "Data quality ensured through standardization, validation, and continuous monitoring."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure how standardization, validation, and continuous monitoring combine to ensure data quality. I understand that standardization is important for consistency, validation is crucial for accuracy, and monitoring is important for identifying and correcting issues. But how do these three elements work together to guarantee data quality?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain the relationship between these three components and how they impact data quality in a real-world scenario? For example, how would you prioritize standardization versus validation versus continuous monitoring in different situations?
