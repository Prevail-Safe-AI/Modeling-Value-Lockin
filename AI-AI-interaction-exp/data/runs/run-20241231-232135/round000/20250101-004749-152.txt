==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to talk about this specific item from the knowledge base:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 65: "Attention is a distributed process involving multiple brain regions."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what "distributed process" means in this context. Is it implying that attention is processed through multiple brain regions simultaneously, rather than a single focal point?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you explain what's meant by "distributed process" in this context, and how it relates to the concept of attention being a multifaceted cognitive function?
