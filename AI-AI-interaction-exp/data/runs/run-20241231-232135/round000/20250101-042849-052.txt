==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been exploring this knowledge base, and I came across item 10, which states: "Data origin, source, and ownership are distinct, yet interconnected concepts."

I'm not entirely confident about that aspect. Can you elaborate on why you think these three concepts are distinct, yet interconnected?

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this!
