==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. And the item is:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 3: "Data integration involves preprocessing, fusion, normalization, and machine learning steps."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what preprocessing, fusion, and normalization entail in the context of data integration. I can understand that machine learning is a step in the process, but I'm unclear about the roles of these other three steps.

Specific Clarifying Question:
How do preprocessing, fusion, and normalization contribute to the overall process of data integration, and what are some real-world examples of each step in action?
