==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been reviewing the knowledge base, and I came across item 8:

{
"id": 8,
"statement": "Geographic and socio-economic barriers impact healthcare access and quality significantly."
}

I'm least confident about this aspect: I'm not sure what makes geographic and socio-economic barriers have such a significant impact on healthcare access and quality. Can you help me understand this better?

Why I'm uncertain: I'm not familiar with the exact mechanisms by which these barriers operate, and I'd like to know more about the specific ways in which they affect healthcare access and quality.

Specific clarifying question: Can you provide some examples of how geographic barriers (e.g., rural vs. urban location) and socio-economic barriers (e.g., income level, education) can affect healthcare access and quality?
