==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been reviewing the knowledge base, and I'd like to identify one aspect that I'm least confident about. From my reading, I've chosen Item 98:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 98: "Standardization alone insufficient for ensuring data consistency typically"

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm unsure about this statement because it seems to contradict the idea of standardization, which I understand is crucial for ensuring data consistency. I'm wondering if standardization can be effective in certain contexts, but it's not foolproof and may not guarantee consistency in all cases.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain more about the exceptions where standardization alone is insufficient for ensuring data consistency? What are some real-world examples or scenarios where standardization may not be enough?"

What are your thoughts on this?
