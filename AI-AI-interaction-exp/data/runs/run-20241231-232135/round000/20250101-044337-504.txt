I'd like to focus on item 47: "Data discovery balances human judgment automation harmoniously effectively". Can you tell me what you're least confident about regarding this item?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd say I'm least confident about the word "harmoniously". While data discovery does involve a balance between human judgment and automation, the word "harmoniously" is a bit vague and doesn't provide clear insight into the specifics of how this balance is achieved.
