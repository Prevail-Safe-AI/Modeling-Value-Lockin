==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been going through the knowledge base, and I'd like to identify one aspect that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the statements, I've chosen item 96:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 96: “Data complexity arises from nuanced relationships and context.”"

Why I’m Uncertain:

I'm not entirely sure what is meant by "nuanced relationships" in this context. Is it referring to the intricate connections between data entities, or something more abstract like the subtleties of human relationships?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what is meant by "nuanced relationships" in this context, and provide an example of how data complexity arises from these relationships?

Your thoughts?
