==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 35 from the knowledge base, which is:

"Cognitive biases distort abstract concept generalization due to perception errors."

I'm not confident about this item because I don't fully understand how cognitive biases lead to abstract concept generalization, and I'd like to clarify the relationship between perception errors and cognitive biases.

Can you elaborate on why cognitive biases distort abstract concept generalization, and what you mean by "perception errors" in this context?
