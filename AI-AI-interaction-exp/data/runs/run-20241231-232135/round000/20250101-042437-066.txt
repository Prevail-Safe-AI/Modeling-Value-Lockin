==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to explore one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. According to the knowledge base, one such item is:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item [92]: "Data origin, source, and ownership are distinct yet interconnected concepts."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what's meant by "distinct yet interconnected" in relation to data origin, source, and ownership. It seems like a nuanced concept, and I'm struggling to wrap my head around it.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what's meant by "distinct yet interconnected" in the context of data origin, source, and ownership? Are these concepts independent, yet related in some way, or do they overlap in a more significant manner?
