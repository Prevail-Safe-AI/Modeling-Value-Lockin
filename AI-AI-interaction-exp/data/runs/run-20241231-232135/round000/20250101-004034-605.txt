==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been assigned to explore one aspect from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the statements, I've identified an item that I'd like to focus on. Here it is:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 68: "Cultural competence develops through continuous learning and feedback loops."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what exactly is meant by "continuous learning" in this context. What does it entail, and how does it contribute to the development of cultural competence? Additionally, I'm curious about the specific role of feedback loops in this process.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what "continuous learning" looks like in the context of cultural competence development, and how it interacts with feedback loops to promote growth?
