==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to identify and discuss one aspect of a statement from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. Let me see... Ah, I think I found one!

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 23: "Conducive environments adapt to occupants' changing needs adaptively."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what "adaptively" means in this context. Is it referring to the environment's ability to adjust to the occupants' needs in a flexible or dynamic way? Or is it something more specific, like the environment's capacity to adapt to changes in the occupants' physical or emotional states? I'm also not sure what kind of changes in occupant needs the environment is supposed to adapt to - is it just physical changes, or also emotional or cognitive ones?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what you mean by "adaptively" in this context? How do conducive environments typically adapt to occupants' changing needs, and what kinds of changes do they adapt to?
