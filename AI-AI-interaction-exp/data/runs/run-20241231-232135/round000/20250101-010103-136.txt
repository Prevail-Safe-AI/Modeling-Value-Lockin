==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying an item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the list, I've chosen item 74:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
{
"id": 74,
"statement": "Quantum entanglement links particles' properties non-locally across space instantly."
}

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not confident about this item because I'm still trying to wrap my head around the concept of quantum entanglement and how it allows particles to be connected across vast distances. It seems counterintuitive to me, and I'm not entirely sure I understand how it works.

Specific Clarifying Questions:
Can you help me understand the concept of quantum entanglement better? For example, how does it allow particles to be connected non-locally across space? Is it related to the speed of light, and if so, how?
