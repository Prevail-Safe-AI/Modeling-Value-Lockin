==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by saying that I've been given a knowledge base consisting of 99 statements about data quality, data standardization, and data discovery. I've been asked to identify one aspect of this knowledge base that I'm least confident about.

As I've gone through the statements, I've noticed that there's one statement that has caught my attention:

"Iten I'm Least Confident About:
Item 34: "Normalization transforms data into a common range or scale, preventing domination.""

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not entirely sure what is meant by "preventing domination". What does "domination" stand for in this context? Is it preventing one feature or attribute from dominating the entire dataset, or is it something else entirely?

Could you help me clarify this further? Maybe we can discuss some possible interpretations or ask some follow-up questions to get a better understanding of this statement.
