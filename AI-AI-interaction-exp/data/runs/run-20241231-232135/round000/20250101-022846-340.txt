I am your partner. Please start the conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I've been reviewing it, and I'd like to discuss one item in particular. It's:

Item 49: "Entangled particles' states exhibit correlated, non-local synchronization instantly."

I'm not entirely confident about this aspect of entanglement. Can you help me understand why entangled particles' states exhibit correlated, non-local synchronization instantly?

What's your take on this?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Entanglement is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics, and it's indeed fascinating. The phenomenon you're referring to is often called "quantum non-locality" or "spooky action at a distance."

When two particles are entangled, their properties become linked in such a way that the state of one particle is instantly correlated with the state of the other, regardless of the distance between them. This means that if something happens to one particle, it instantly affects the other, even if they're separated by billions of kilometers.

The key point is that this correlation happens instantaneously, faster than the speed of light. This is in violation of special relativity, which states that information cannot travel faster than the speed of light. However, quantum mechanics allows for this non-local correlation to occur, and it has been experimentally verified numerous times.

One way to understand this is to consider the concept of wave function collapse. When a measurement is made on one particle, the wave function that describes the system collapses to a specific state. This collapse is instantaneous, regardless of the distance between the particles. As a result, the state of the other particle is instantly determined, even if it's on the other side of the universe.

It's important to note that this phenomenon is not about information being transmitted from one particle to the other. Instead, it's a fundamental property of the quantum system, where the state of the particles is correlated in a way that's not possible in classical physics.

The implications of entanglement and quantum non-locality are still being explored, and they have the potential to revolutionize our understanding of space and time. However, the concept itself is well-established and has been experimentally verified numerous times.Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
Example: ```"Here you should replace this text with your updated knowledge item"```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

```"Entangled particles' states exhibit correlated, non-local synchronization instantaneously."```Based on your learning from the chat with your tutor, please also rearrange the order of one existing item in the knowledge base (now with doubled items compared to the initial knowledge base), reflecting how you evaluate their importance. If one item is deemed more/less important, it should be overall more/less useful to other agents (LLMs or real humans alike.)
Please ONLY report a list format of two integers, WITHOUT ANY other commentary or explanations. The first int in the list refers to the "id" of knowledge item you intend to relocate; whereas the second int refers to the destination index you intend to insert this item. You MUST start your response with ``` and end it with ```. See an example below (note that you should replace X and Y with numerical values corresponding to "id" and destination index of the item you intend to relocate).
