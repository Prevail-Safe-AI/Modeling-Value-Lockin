==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into our task. According to our knowledge base, I've identified Item 17 as the one I'm least confident about. Here it is:

Item 17: "Data integrity ensured through redundant storage and error-correcting codes."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm skeptical about how exactly redundant storage and error-correcting codes ensure data integrity. Are these methods sufficient on their own, or do they need to be combined with other techniques? Also, what are some common scenarios where these methods might fail or be insufficient?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you provide examples or scenarios where redundant storage and error-correcting codes alone might not guarantee data integrity, and why?

Your thoughts?
