==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into our knowledge base. I'd like to discuss item 27: "Prioritizing social and environmental responsibility benefits business reputation."

I have to admit, I'm not entirely confident about this aspect. I'd like to understand why prioritizing social and environmental responsibility would directly benefit a business's reputation. Can you elaborate on the underlying reasons or mechanisms that connect these two concepts?

I'm curious to know more about the causal relationship between the two, and how it translates to a business's reputation.
