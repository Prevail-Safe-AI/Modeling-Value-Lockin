==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss one of the knowledge base items, specifically item 78. 

Item I'm Least Confident About:
{
  "id": 78,
  "statement": "Data governance ensures quality through framework, policies, metrics, and validation."
}

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what "validation" refers to in this context. Does it mean regular checks to ensure the data is correct, or something else?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you explain what you mean by "validation" in the context of data governance, and how it contributes to ensuring data quality?
