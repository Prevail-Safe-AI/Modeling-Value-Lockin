==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to focus on one aspect from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. According to the knowledge base, it is:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 97: "Systemic and structural factors shape cultural competence development significantly."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm unclear about what exactly systemic and structural factors are, in the context of cultural competence development. Are they purely external factors, or do they also involve individual-level processes?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what you mean by "systemic and structural factors" in this context? Are they related to societal, economic, or political structures, or do they also encompasses internal factors, such as an individual's cognitive biases or emotional processes?
