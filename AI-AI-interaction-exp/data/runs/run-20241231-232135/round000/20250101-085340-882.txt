==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been reviewing the knowledge base, and I'm going to pick one item that I'm least confident about. It's:

Item 25: "Consistency, accuracy, completeness are interconnected data quality aspects."

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not sure what it means by "interconnected". Are they just related, or does this imply a direct causal relationship between these three aspects? 

Specific Clarifying Question: Can you explain what's meant by "interconnected" in this context, and provide an example to illustrate the relationship between consistency, accuracy, and completeness?
