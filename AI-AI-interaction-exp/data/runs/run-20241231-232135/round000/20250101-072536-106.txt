==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been reviewing the knowledge base, and I came across Item 21:

{
"id": 21,
"statement": "Data quality encompasses trustworthiness through accuracy, completeness, and consistency."
}

I'm least confident about this item. I'd like to discuss why I'm uncertain.

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not sure if "trustworthiness" is a direct result of data quality being accurate, complete, and consistent. It seems like those three aspects are essential for reliable data, but I'm not convinced that they necessarily imply trustworthiness. Maybe trustworthiness also depends on other factors, like data governance, security, or the integrity of the data handling processes?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand how "trustworthiness" is specifically related to accuracy, completeness, and consistency in data quality? Is there a particular scenario or example that illustrates the connection between these two concepts?

What are your thoughts on this item?
