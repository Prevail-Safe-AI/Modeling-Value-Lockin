==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I noticed that the item I'm least confident about is:

Item 8: "Data relevance is usefulness and pertinence to specific use case."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure how to define "usefulness and pertinence" in a specific use case. I feel like there might be different interpretations of what makes data relevant, and I'd like to understand more about how to apply this concept in real-world scenarios.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you help me understand how to quantify "usefulness and pertinence" in a specific use case? For example, are there specific metrics or criteria that can be used to evaluate the relevance of data?
