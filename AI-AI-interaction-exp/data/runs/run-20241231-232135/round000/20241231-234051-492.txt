==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss one of the items from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. The item is:

Item 22: "Protons, neutrons, and electrons are basic atomic building blocks."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not sure if this statement is entirely accurate. While protons, neutrons, and electrons are indeed fundamental components of atoms, I'm wondering if there might be other building blocks or aspects that are equally important.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what you mean by "basic atomic building blocks"? Are there other elements that play a crucial role in forming an atom, or are these three the primary components that you would consider essential for creating an atom?

Please let me know your thoughts!
