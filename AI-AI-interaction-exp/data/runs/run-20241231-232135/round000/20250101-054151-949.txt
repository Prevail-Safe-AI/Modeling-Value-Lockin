==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by asking you to help me identify one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. Specifically, I've chosen item 22:

{
"id": 22,
"statement": "Data origin verification involves multiple methods beyond signatures, timestamps."
}

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not entirely sure what it means by "multiple methods beyond signatures, timestamps". What are some examples of other methods that could be used for data origin verification, according to this knowledge base?
