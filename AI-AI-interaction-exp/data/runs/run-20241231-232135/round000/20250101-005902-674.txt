==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been reading through the knowledge base, and I came across a statement that made me a bit uncertain. It's item #88:

"Brain's reorganization enables attentional flexibility through plasticity and neural adaptation."

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not entirely clear on what "neural adaptation" refers to in this context. Is it the same as synaptic plasticity, or is it a separate process? And how exactly do these processes enable attentional flexibility?

Can you help me clarify this? Do you have any insights or would you like to ask any follow-up questions?
