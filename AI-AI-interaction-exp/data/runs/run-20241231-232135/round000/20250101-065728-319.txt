==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the knowledge base we're working with. Specifically, I'd like to identify one aspect of it that I'm least confident about.

After reviewing the knowledge base, I've chosen Item 92:

{
"id": 92,
"statement": "Abstract AI reasoning simulates human cognition through complex mental maps."
}

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not entirely clear on what is meant by "complex mental maps". I understand that AI reasoning involves simulating human cognition, but I'm not sure what constitutes a "complex mental map" in this context.

Can you help me better understand this concept?

Specifically, I'd love to know: What do you think "complex mental maps" refer to in the context of Abstract AI reasoning?
