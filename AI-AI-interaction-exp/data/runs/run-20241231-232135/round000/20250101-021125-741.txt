==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 69 from the knowledge base:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 69: "Data integration involves multiple steps beyond machine learning preprocessing, normalization, fusion, and machine learning."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what "multiple steps" implies. Are these additional steps essential, or are they optional in certain cases? I'm wondering if there's a specific context or scenario where these additional steps might be necessary.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you help me understand what these "multiple steps" entail, and are there any specific examples or use cases where they're particularly relevant?
