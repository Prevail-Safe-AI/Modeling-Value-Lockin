==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm least confident about the statement "Wave function collapse triggers entanglement's instantaneous effect".

I'm uncertain about this statement because the concept of wave function collapse is still a topic of debate among physicists, and there's no consensus on whether it's a real phenomenon or just an effective mathematical tool. Additionally, the nature of entanglement and its instantaneous effect is still not fully understood, and there are different interpretations of quantum mechanics that can explain the phenomenon without relying on wave function collapse.
