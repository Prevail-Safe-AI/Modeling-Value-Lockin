==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been looking at the knowledge base, and I'm going to identify one aspect that I'm least confident about. That aspect is:

Item 69: "Data discovery involves systematic identification, cataloging, and documentation of data sources"

Why I'm uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what "systematic identification" means in the context of data discovery. Is it a specific methodology or process that needs to be followed? And what exactly does "cataloging" refer to? Is it a physical process of putting data sources in a catalog or is it more related to creating a digital database of data sources?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what is meant by "systematic identification" in data discovery? And what is the purpose of cataloging data sources in this process?
