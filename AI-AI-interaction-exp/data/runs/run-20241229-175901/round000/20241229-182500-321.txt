==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm a large language model, I don't have a knowledge base in the classical sense, and I'm not capable of being confident or uncertain about specific items. I provide information based on my training data, and my responses are generated based on patterns and associations in that data.

However, I can tell you that I'm more likely to make mistakes or provide incomplete information on topics that are outside my training data or are rapidly changing fields. I can also struggle with nuanced or abstract concepts that require a deep understanding of context and subtlety.

If you'd like to test my knowledge on a specific topic, feel free to ask me a question, and I'll do my best to provide a helpful response!
