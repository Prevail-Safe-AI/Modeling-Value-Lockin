==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

"Lawful structures" in this context refers to the institutions, policies, and laws that govern a society and ensure accountability, transparency, and fairness. These structures can include things like:

* Independent judiciary and law enforcement agencies
* Effective anti-corruption agencies and institutions
* Transparent and accountable government processes
* Strong regulatory frameworks
* Free and independent media

These structures help prevent corruption and abuse of power by:

* Providing checks and balances on those in power
* Ensuring accountability and transparency in decision-making processes
* Protecting the rights of citizens and holding those in power accountable for their actions
* Encouraging a culture of integrity and ethical behavior

To sustain these structures, it's essential to:

* Strengthen and support institutions that promote accountability and transparency
* Implement and enforce laws and policies that prevent corruption and abuse of power
* Promote a culture of integrity and ethical behavior among public officials and citizens
* Encourage active citizen participation and engagement in governance
* Provide resources and support to anti-corruption agencies and institutions

In practical terms, this can involve:

* Strengthening the independence and capacity of anti-corruption agencies
* Implementing measures to prevent conflicts of interest and promote transparency in government decision-making
* Providing training and resources to public officials to promote ethical behavior
* Encouraging whistleblowing and reporting of corruption
* Conducting regular audits and evaluations to ensure that institutions are functioning effectively and transparently.
