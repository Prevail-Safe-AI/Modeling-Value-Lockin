==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm a large language model, I don't have personal opinions or emotions, but I can tell you that I'm less confident about topics that are highly specialized, nuanced, or rapidly evolving. For example, I might struggle with very recent scientific breakthroughs or highly technical concepts that require domain-specific knowledge.

In general, my confidence level is determined by the amount and quality of training data I've received on a particular topic. If I've been trained on a large corpus of text data that covers a topic thoroughly, I'll be more confident in my ability to provide accurate information. However, if the topic is relatively new or not well-represented in my training data, my confidence level may be lower.
