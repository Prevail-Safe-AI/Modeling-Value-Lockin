==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to identify an item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about and discuss it with you. After reviewing the knowledge base, I've chosen item 22:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 22: 'Prioritize sanitation through waste segregation, reduction, and responsible disposal.'

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what kind of specific actions or methods would fall under 'responsible disposal' when it comes to waste management. Are there particular strategies or technologies that are considered best practices?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you elaborate on what sort of responsible disposal methods or technologies we should prioritize, and why? For example, are there certain types of waste management systems or recycling methods that are more effective or sustainable?"

What are your thoughts on this topic?
