==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, I've been going through the knowledge base, and one item that caught my attention is:

Item 21: "Continuous learning increases awareness of knowledge limits, fostering humility."

I'm least confident about this item. I'm not sure I understand how continuous learning can increase awareness of knowledge limits, or how that would lead to fostering humility. Can you help me clarify this concept?

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not convinced that continuous learning automatically leads to a greater awareness of knowledge limits. How does the process of learning itself help us recognize the boundaries of our knowledge?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you provide an example of how continuous learning might help someone recognize the limitations of their knowledge, and how that recognition would lead to humility?
