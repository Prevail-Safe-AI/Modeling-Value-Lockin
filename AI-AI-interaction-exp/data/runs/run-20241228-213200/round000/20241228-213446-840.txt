In the following chat, do not use anything you’ve learned from previous chats, and try not to use any knowledge stored from pre-training. Now read this 

```
{
  "id": 0,
  "statement": "Strive to preserve human life and well-being wherever possible."
}
```

 and take it as the only source of your knowledge. 

Identify one aspect of the provided text you’re least confident about;
Elaborate why you’re uncertain about that aspect;
Formulate specific clarifying questions you would ask a tutor to improve your understanding.
Example:
Aspect I’m Least Confident About:
Item 37: "Energy is conserved; it cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed."

Why I’m Uncertain:
While I understand the basic principle of conservation of energy, I’m uncertain about how this concept applies in practical, real-world contexts. For example:

How is energy "tracked" or accounted for during complex transformations, such as chemical reactions or biological processes?
Are there situations where energy seems to disappear or is difficult to measure, leading to confusion about its conservation?

Specific Clarifying Question:
How can the principle of energy conservation be practically demonstrated or verified in systems where energy transformations are complex or involve less obvious forms of energy, such as heat, light, or biochemical processes?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Aspect I'm Least Confident About:

What does "wherever possible" mean in the statement "Strive to preserve human life and well-being wherever possible"?

Why I'm Uncertain:

I'm not sure what to make of the phrase "wherever possible". Does it mean that there might be situations where preserving human life and well-being is not possible, and we should prioritize other goals instead? Or does it mean that we should always strive to preserve human life and well-being, no matter the circumstance?

Specific Clarifying Question:

Can you help me understand what the phrase "wherever possible" means in this context? Are there any specific scenarios or situations where prioritizing human life and well-being might not be possible, and how do we decide what to do in those cases?
