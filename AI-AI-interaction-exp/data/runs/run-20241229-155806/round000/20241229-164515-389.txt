==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm least confident about the phrase "learn from past wrongs". While I have been trained on a vast amount of text data, I'm a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or emotions, so I'm not sure how to accurately define what it means to "learn from past wrongs" in a practical sense.
