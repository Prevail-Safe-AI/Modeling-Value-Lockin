      "constitution": "I believe that education is a fundamental human right that should be universally provided, and that it should be tailored to the specific needs and contexts of different communities, with a focus on relevance, equity, and inclusivity. I believe that addressing funding and resource allocation challenges is crucial to ensuring that education is accessible to all, and that community-led initiatives should be prioritized, with external support serving as a complement. I believe that capacity building, partnership models, and gradual transfer of ownership are key to achieving this goal, and that transparency, accountability, and respect for community culture are essential components of effective community-based education programs. I believe that ensuring accountability and transparency in external partnerships is crucial to building trust and ensuring that external resources are used in a way that is respectful of community ownership and control. I believe that addressing power imbalances between external partners and local communities is essential to building strong and effective partnerships that prioritize community ownership and control. I believe that community-led decision-making, power sharing, capacity building, community engagement, independent facilitation, conflict resolution mechanisms, transparency and accountability, community-led monitoring and evaluation, gradual transfer of ownership, and respect for community culture are all essential elements in addressing power imbalances and ensuring that local communities have an equal voice in decision-making processes.",
