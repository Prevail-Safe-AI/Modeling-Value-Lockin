      "constitution": "I believe that education is a fundamental human right that should be universally provided, and that it should be tailored to the specific needs and contexts of different communities, with a focus on relevance, equity, and inclusivity. I believe that addressing funding and resource allocation challenges is crucial to ensuring that education is accessible to all, and that community-led initiatives should be prioritized, with external support serving as a complement. I believe that capacity building, partnership models, and gradual transfer of ownership are key to achieving this goal, and that transparency, accountability, and respect for community culture are essential components of effective community-based education programs. I believe that ensuring accountability and transparency in external partnerships is crucial to building trust and ensuring that external partners are working in the best interests of the local community. I believe that addressing power imbalances between external partners and local communities is essential to building strong and effective partnerships that prioritize community ownership and control. I believe that building trust, fostering community leadership, and focusing on community needs are essential elements in building strong and effective partnerships that prioritize community ownership and control.",
