==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm going to choose an item from the list that I'm least confident about, and then discuss why I'm uncertain about it, and hopefully get some clarification.

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 70: "Encourage creative expression through art, music, and storytelling."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely confident about this because I'm not sure what the boundaries are for encouraging creative expression. For example, are we talking about encouraging people toexpress themselves through traditional art forms, or also through more modern forms like digital art or music production software? Also, how do we set boundaries around creative expression, such as ensuring that it doesn't infringe on others' intellectual property or rights?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what specific forms of creative expression are included in this item, and how we should balance encouraging creativity with ensuring that it doesn't cause harm to others?
