    "statement": "Matter is composed of atoms, which consist of protons, neutrons, and electrons. Protons and neutrons reside in the nucleus, while electrons orbit around it. The number of protons determines the element, and the number of neutrons can vary, resulting in different isotopes. The number of electrons is equal to the number of protons, and it determines the chemical properties of an atom. The interaction between these components is crucial, as protons, neutrons, and electrons attract and repel each other, determining the chemical reactivity and properties of elements."
