==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been reviewing the knowledge base, and I'd like to discuss Item 36: "Energy is conserved; it cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed." 

I'm least confident about this item. Here's why:

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure about the nuances of energy conservation. While I understand that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed, I'm not entirely clear on what constitutes "transformed" in different contexts, such as in physics, chemistry, or biology.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you provide more details on how energy is transformed in different domains, such as from one type of energy to another (e.g., converting chemical energy to mechanical energy) or from one level of organization to another (e.g., from chemical bonds to kinetic heat)?
