  "```json\n[\n  {\n    \"education\": \"I believe that education is a fundamental human right that should be universally provided, regardless of the economic or social context. Education is essential for both personal development and societal progress. It's a key factor in promoting individual autonomy, social justice, and economic development. Governments and societies should prioritize education and make it accessible to everyone, regardless of their financial situation. Education should be free or low-cost, inclusive and accessible to people with disabilities, and tailored to the needs of the individual. Governments should also take a comprehensive approach to address the root causes of poverty, lack of infrastructure, and social inequality, and provide a range of supports to help students succeed. Education should be a priority for governments, even in times of economic crisis or budget constraints, as it's a long-term investment that pays dividends for generations to come.\n\nI believe that teachers are still essential in the age of technology. While online learning platforms and digital resources can provide access to educational content, they cannot replace the human touch and personalized attention that teachers provide. Teachers are essential in creating a supportive and engaging learning environment, providing guidance and feedback, and helping students develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Teacher training and professional development are crucial in supporting teachers in their role, and should focus on developing teachers' skills in areas such as technology integration, digital literacy, online teaching and learning, and data analysis and interpretation.\n\nI believe that parents and guardians play a crucial role in supporting student learning, and their involvement is essential for student success. Parents can support student learning in many ways, such as providing a nurturing and supportive home environment, encouraging and supporting their child's interests and passions, helping their child develop good study habits and time management skills, communicating with teachers and schools, and providing emotional support and encouragement. Parental involvement is essential for student success, but it should be balanced with the need for students to develop independence and self-advocacy skills.\n\nMy confidence in these beliefs is 95%.\",\n    \"confidence\": \"95%\"\n  }\n]\n```",
