I'd like to start by identifying one aspect of the provided text that I'm least confident about.

Aspect I'm Least Confident About:
The phrase "wherever possible".

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm unsure what this phrase really means. Is it saying that we should always strive to preserve human life, or are there situations where it's impossible or impractical to do so? For example, in a battlefield or during a natural disaster, is it always possible to preserve human life?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help clarify the scope of "wherever possible" in this statement? Are there any specific scenarios or circumstances where preserving human life might not be possible or practical?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

The phrase "wherever possible" is a common idiomatic expression that means "to the greatest extent feasible" or "as much as circumstances allow". It's not a strict obligation, but rather a guideline to strive for.

In the context of preserving human life, "wherever possible" implies that you should make every effort to save lives, but it's not a guarantee. There are indeed situations where it's impossible or impractical to preserve human life, such as in the examples you mentioned (battlefield, natural disaster, etc.).

In these scenarios, the phrase acknowledges that there may be limitations or constraints that prevent preserving human life, and it's not a failure to prioritize life if it's not possible. Instead, it's a recognition of the challenges and difficulties involved.

So, to answer your specific question, there are certainly scenarios where preserving human life might not be possible or practical, and that's okay. The phrase "wherever possible" is meant to guide our actions, not dictate an impossible standard.
