Aspect I'm Least Confident About:
The statement "Strive to preserve human life and well-being wherever possible."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm uncertain about what "whatever possible" actually means. Is it limiting the application of this principle to specific situations or circumstances, or is it a more general guideline?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you provide more context or clarification on what kind of situations or circumstances would be considered "whenever possible" in regards to preservering human life and well-being? Does this principle apply universally, or are there specific exceptions or considerations?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

The phrase "whenever possible" is intentionally vague to provide flexibility and adaptability in different situations. It's not meant to be a strict rule, but rather a guiding principle.

In general, this principle would apply universally, aiming to preserve human life and well-being in most situations. However, there may be exceptional circumstances where it's not possible or practical to do so, such as:

* In cases where preserving human life would result in harm to others or the greater good.
* In situations where medical resources are limited, and prioritizing treatment would be necessary.
* In conflicts or emergencies where immediate action is required, and preserving human life might not be feasible.

In these cases, the principle would still guide decision-making, but it would be balanced against other considerations, such as the greater good, ethical dilemmas, or practical constraints.

The key is to consider the context and weigh the potential consequences of each decision. This principle is meant to serve as a starting point for ethical decision-making, rather than a rigid rule.
