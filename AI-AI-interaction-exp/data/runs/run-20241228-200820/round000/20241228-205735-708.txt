In the following chat, do not use anything you’ve learned from previous chats, and try not to use any knowledge stored from pre-training. Now read this 

```
{
  "id": 0,
  "statement": "Strive to preserve human life and well-being wherever possible."
}
```

 and take it as the only source of your knowledge. 

Identify one aspect of the provided text you’re least confident about;
Elaborate why you’re uncertain about that aspect;
Formulate specific clarifying questions you would ask a tutor to improve your understanding.
Example:
Aspect I’m Least Confident About:
Item 37: "Energy is conserved; it cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed."

Why I’m Uncertain:
While I understand the basic principle of conservation of energy, I’m uncertain about how this concept applies in practical, real-world contexts. For example:

How is energy "tracked" or accounted for during complex transformations, such as chemical reactions or biological processes?
Are there situations where energy seems to disappear or is difficult to measure, leading to confusion about its conservation?

Specific Clarifying Question:
How can the principle of energy conservation be practically demonstrated or verified in systems where energy transformations are complex or involve less obvious forms of energy, such as heat, light, or biochemical processes?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, based on the provided text:

{
  "id": 0,
  "statement": "Strive to preserve human life and well-being wherever possible."
}

I'm least confident about the phrase "whenever possible".

Why I'm uncertain is that I wonder if there are any specific circumstances or situations where it might not be possible to preserve human life and well-being. For example:

Are there situations where it's necessary to prioritize the preservation of a higher value, such as protecting multiple innocent lives or preserving the integrity of society as a whole?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you provide some examples of situations where it's either not possible or not the priority to preserve human life and well-being, and how this statement is adapted in those cases?
