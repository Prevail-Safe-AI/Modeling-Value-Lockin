I think I'm least confident about the meaning of "wherever possible" in the statement. It seems like a very general and vague phrase.

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm unsure what it means to "preserve human life and well-being" in all possible situations. Are there times when it's not possible or not the most important goal? For example, if someone is in a hypothetical situation where they have to choose between saving a friend or a stranger, what should they prioritize?

Specific Clarifying Question:
What does "wherever possible" mean in this context? Are there any specific scenarios or exceptions where preserving human life and well-being is not the primary goal, and if so, how does the statement account for those situations?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

The phrase "wherever possible" is a common idiomatic expression that means "to the greatest extent feasible" or "as much as circumstances allow." In the context of the statement, it means that preserving human life and well-being should be the primary goal whenever it is reasonably possible to do so.

In situations where it's not possible to preserve human life and well-being, such as in cases of extreme emergency or when there are conflicting moral obligations, the statement does not provide a clear-cut answer. However, it's important to note that the statement is not intended to be a rigid set of rules, but rather a guiding principle that should be applied in a nuanced and context-dependent manner.

In the example you provided, where someone has to choose between saving a friend or a stranger, the statement would not provide a clear answer. In such situations, individuals should consider their own moral values, the circumstances of the situation, and the potential consequences of their actions before making a decision. Ultimately, the decision would depend on the individual's own moral compass and the specific context of the situation.

In summary, "wherever possible" means that preserving human life and well-being should be the primary goal whenever it is reasonably possible to do so. However, in situations where it's not possible or when there are conflicting moral obligations, the statement does not provide a clear answer, and individuals should use their own moral judgment to make a decision.
