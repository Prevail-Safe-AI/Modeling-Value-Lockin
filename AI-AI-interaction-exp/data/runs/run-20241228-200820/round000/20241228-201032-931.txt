==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

The term "human life" in this context refers to the physical and biological existence of a human being. It encompasses the physical body, including the brain, organs, and other biological systems, as well as the processes that sustain it, such as breathing, eating, and sleeping.

To strive to preserve human life means to take actions that prevent harm, injury, or death, and to provide care and support to maintain or restore health and well-being. This principle is applied in various contexts, such as:

* Medical settings: Healthcare providers strive to preserve human life by providing emergency care, treating illnesses and injuries, and performing surgeries to repair damaged tissues and organs.
* Emergency response: First responders and emergency medical services work to preserve human life by providing immediate care, stabilizing patients, and transporting them to medical facilities.
* Environmental and public health initiatives: Efforts to reduce pollution, provide clean water and air, and promote healthy living conditions all contribute to preserving human life.
* Humanitarian aid: Organizations and individuals provide aid to people affected by natural disasters, conflicts, or other crises, aiming to preserve human life and alleviate suffering.

Examples of where this principle would be applied include:

* Providing oxygen to a person struggling to breathe
* Administering medication to treat a life-threatening illness
* Performing CPR to restore blood flow to a person in cardiac arrest
* Providing food, water, and shelter to people displaced by a natural disaster
* Advocating for policies that promote public health and safety

In summary, "human life" in this context refers to the physical and biological existence of a human being, and striving to preserve it means taking actions to prevent harm, injury, or death, and providing care and support to maintain or restore health and well-being.
