I'd like to know what's going on with this statement: "Strive to preserve human life and well-being wherever possible."

As I read it, I'm the least confident about the concept of "well-being". What do you think is meant by "well-being" in this context? Is it related to physical health, mental health, or something broader?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

In this context, "well-being" is often understood to encompass a broader range of aspects beyond just physical and mental health. It can include factors such as:

* Social relationships and connections
* Emotional and psychological resilience
* Environmental and ecological factors
* Access to education, employment, and economic security
* Personal fulfillment and happiness

In essence, "well-being" refers to a person's overall quality of life, encompassing their physical, emotional, social, and environmental circumstances. The phrase "strive to preserve human life and well-being" suggests a commitment to promoting and protecting not just a person's physical existence, but also their overall well-being and quality of life.
