==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 7,
"statement": "The thalamus refines sensory info through iterative cortical feedback loops."
}

I'm least confident about this item, and I'd like to understand it better. Here's what I'm uncertain about:

I'm not sure how the thalamus refines sensory information through iterative cortical feedback loops. What does "iterative cortical feedback loops" mean in this context? How does this process work exactly?

Can you help me understand this aspect better?

What do you think?
