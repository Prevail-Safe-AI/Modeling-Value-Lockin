==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the first item from the knowledge base:

{
"id": 80,
"statement": "Moral development emerges from interplay of biological, cultural factors."
}

I'm curious, what aspect of this item from knowledge base you're least confident about?

In other words, is it the concept of "moral development", the role of "biological factors", "cultural factors", or something else that's unclear to you?
