==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the knowledge base item:

{
  "id": 79,
  "statement": "Situational awareness adapts to changing circumstances through continuous processing."
}

I'm least confident about this aspect of the item: How exactly does "continuous processing" enable situational awareness to adapt to changing circumstances?

I'm unsure about how the processing happens and what kind of changes the awareness can accommodate. Can you help me understand this better?

Can you elaborate on why you think situational awareness is able to adapt in this way?

What are some real-world examples that demonstrate this concept in action?

Please share your thoughts!
