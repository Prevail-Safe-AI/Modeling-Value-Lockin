Let's talk about the item from the knowledge base:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 20,
  "statement": "Thalamus refines and filters sensory info for cortical processing."
}
```

Things I'm Uncertain About This Item:

Honestly, I'm a bit uncertain about the phrase "refines and filters sensory info" in this statement. I'm not entirely sure what it means by "refines" and how the thalamus does this process.

Can you help me understand what's meant by "refines" in this context? How does the thalamus refine sensory information?
