==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the statements in the knowledge base. I'd like to discuss item number 55. It says:

"Hierarchical brain structure enables complex information processing through multiple levels."

I'm not entirely confident about this aspect. I'd like to know more about what does "enables complex information processing" mean in this context?

Can you elaborate on what you think this statement means or why you think it's important?
