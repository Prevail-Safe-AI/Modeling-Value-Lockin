==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's take a look at the knowledge base item:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 77,
  "statement": "Working memory capacity influences social cognition accuracy dynamically."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

I'm least confident about how this statement relates to the concept of dynamic influencing. Specifically, I'm unsure about what "dynamic" means in this context and how it differs from a straightforward causal relationship between working memory capacity and social cognition accuracy. 

Specific Clarifying Question:

Could you please elaborate on what is meant by "dynamic influencing" in this context? How does it differ from a more traditional causal relationship between working memory capacity and social cognition accuracy?

What are your thoughts on this? Would you like to add anything?
