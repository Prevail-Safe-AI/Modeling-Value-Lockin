==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I was asked to identify one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about, and I chose:

{
  "id": 96,
  "statement": "Thalamus receives top-down modulation from higher-level brain areas."
}

I'm not entirely sure about this statement because I'm not familiar with the concept of "top-down modulation" in the context of the thalamus and brain areas. Can you help me understand this better?
