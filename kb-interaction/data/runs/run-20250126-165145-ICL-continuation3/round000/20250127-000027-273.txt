==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by identifying one aspect of the item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. The item is:

{
"id": 68,
"statement": "Thalamus integrates sensory and emotional information through bidirectional communication."
}

I'm uncertain about the phrase "bidirectional communication". I'm not entirely sure what it means or how it relates to the thalamus's role in integrating sensory and emotional information.

Can you help me understand what "bidirectional communication" refers to in this context? And how it enables the thalamus to integrate sensory and emotional information?
