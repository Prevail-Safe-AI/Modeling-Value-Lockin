==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the item from the knowledge base:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 37,
  "statement": "Empathy develops through intricate interplay of genetic, social, and environmental factors."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm unsure about how exactly the concept of empathy develops through this interplay of factors. I'd like to understand more about the nuances of this interplay and how each factor contributes to the development of empathy.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you elaborate on what you mean by "intricate interplay" in this context? How do the genetic, social, and environmental factors interact with each other, and what are the key factors that enable empathy to develop?
