==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item from the knowledge base:

```
{
  "id": 81,
  "statement": "Genetic variations influence emotional regulation through epigenetic mechanisms."
}
```

I'm least confident about this item because I'm not familiar with epigenetic mechanisms and how they relate to emotional regulation. Can you elaborate on what epigenetic mechanisms are and how they influence emotional regulation?
