==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item "Cortical predictions refine thalamic filtering through corticothalamic connections and synaptic plasticity" (ID 43). I'm least confident about the aspect that says "Cortical predictions refine thalamic filtering through corticothalamic connections".

Can you help me understand why cortical predictions refine thalamic filtering in the first place? And how exactly does this refinement happen through corticothalamic connections and synaptic plasticity?

What's your take on this?
