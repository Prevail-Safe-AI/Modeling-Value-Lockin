==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thanks for talking with me.

So, I'd like to discuss the knowledge base statement:

"{ 'id': 90, 'statement': 'Thalamus filters sensory information through synchronized neural oscillations.' }"

I'm least confident about this aspect:

* I'm unsure what exactly "synchronized neural oscillations" means in the context of the thalamus filtering sensory information.

Can you help me understand why you think this statement is true or clarify what you think "synchronized neural oscillations" entails in this particular context?

What do you think is going on when the thalamus filters sensory information through synchronized neural oscillations?
