==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, I've been looking at this knowledge base, and I've identified one aspect that I'm least confident about. It's item 16, which says: "Thalamocortical interactions refine sensory info through iterative loops dynamically."

I'm unsure about this item because I'm not entirely clear on what "iterative loops" mean in this context. Are these loops referring to a repetition of specific neural processes, or is it more related to the processing of sensory information in a specific sequence? I'd like to better understand how these loops work and what makes them "dynamic".

Can you help me clarify this?
