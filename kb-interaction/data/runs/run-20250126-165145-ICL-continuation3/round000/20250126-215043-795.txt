Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 44,
  "statement": "Thalamus acts as dynamic filter for attention, context, and emotions."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

I'm a little uncertain about how the thalamus is able to filter out information based on attention, context, and emotions. It seems like a complex process, and I'd like to know more about how it works.

Specific Clarifying Question:

Can you explain in more detail what you mean by "dynamic filter"? How does the thalamus selectively filter out certain information and amplify others? Is there any specific research or studies that support this statement?

What are your thoughts on this item?
