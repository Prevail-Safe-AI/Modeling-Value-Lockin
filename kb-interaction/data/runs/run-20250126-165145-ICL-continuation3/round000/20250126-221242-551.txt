==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start with the task. We need to discuss the knowledge base item with id 45, which is:

"Alpha oscillations modulate cortical communication through neural synchrony."

I'm going to identify one aspect of this item that I'm least confident about. That aspect is: "How exactly do alpha oscillations modulate cortical communication through neural synchrony?"

I'm uncertain about this because I don't fully understand the relationship between alpha oscillations and neural synchrony in the context of cortical communication. Can you help me understand this better?

What are your thoughts on this?
