==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item #47 from the knowledge base:

{
"id": 47,
"statement": "Thalamus coordinates neural oscillations for efficient sensory processing."
}

I'm least confident about this aspect: How does the thalamus actually coordinate neural oscillations for efficient sensory processing?

Can you help me understand this better? Maybe there are some specific mechanisms or processes involved that I'm not aware of?

You're the expert!
