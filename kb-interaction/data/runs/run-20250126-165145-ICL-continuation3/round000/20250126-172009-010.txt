==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 53: "The thalamus adapts filtering to attentional demands dynamically."

I'm not entirely confident about this item. Can you help me understand why the thalamus would adapt filtering to attentional demands? What does "adapting filtering" mean in this context?
