==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into it. 

The item I'd like to discuss is:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 39,
"statement": "Thalamus integrates sensory info through hierarchical neural processing."
}

I'm least confident about the phrase "hierarchical neural processing". Could you elaborate what you think hierarchical neural processing refers to in the context of the thalamus?
