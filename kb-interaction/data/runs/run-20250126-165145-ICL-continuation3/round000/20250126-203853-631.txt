==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item "Alpha oscillations modulate synaptic plasticity for attentional filtering." (Item #25 in the knowledge base).

I'm not confident about this item, specifically about how alpha oscillations modulate synaptic plasticity for attentional filtering. To be honest, I don't fully understand the mechanism behind this relationship.

Can you help me clarify what this item means and how it works? What exactly does "synaptic plasticity" refer to in this context?
