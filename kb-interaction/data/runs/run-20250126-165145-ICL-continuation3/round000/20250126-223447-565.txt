==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's take a look at the item:

{
"id": 59,
"statement": "Building trust involves emotional connections, communication, and reliability."
}

I'm not super confident about this item, and I'd like to ask you: What do you think it means by "emotional connections" in this context? Is it just about feeling emotions for someone, or is it something more specific?
