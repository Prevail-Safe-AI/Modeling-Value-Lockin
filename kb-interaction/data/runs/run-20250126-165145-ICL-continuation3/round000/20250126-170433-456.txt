==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item about honesty and trust. I'd like to discuss the item: 

{
"id": 27,
"statement": "Honesty's foundation built on consistency, predictability, reliability."
}

I'm least confident about the aspect that says "honesty's foundation" is built on consistency, predictability, and reliability. 

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not entirely sure how these concepts - consistency, predictability, and reliability - specifically contribute to building the foundation of honesty. It seems like these concepts are often associated with trust and trust-building, but how do they directly relate to honesty? 

Can you help me clarify this?
