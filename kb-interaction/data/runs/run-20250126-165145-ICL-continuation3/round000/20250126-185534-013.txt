==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by identifying an aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. It's the following item:

```
{
  "id": 7,
  "statement": "Thalamocortical interactions involve bidirectional communication between thalamus and cortex."
}
```

I'm uncertain about the specific mechanisms involved in the bidirectional communication mentioned in this statement. Can you elaborate on what you think "bidirectional communication" means in this context?

Also, I'd like to know how this communication process relates to the other items in the knowledge base, such as items related to neural oscillations and sensory information processing.
