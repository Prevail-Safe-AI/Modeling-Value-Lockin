==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start by discussing the item:

{
"id": 24,
"statement": "Thalamus prioritizes sensory info through attention-emotions-context hierarchy."
}

I'm going to be honest, I'm a bit uncertain about this item. I'd like to know more about what it means to prioritize sensory information through an attention-emotions-context hierarchy. Can you help me understand it better?

What do you think this statement is trying to convey? How does the thalamus exactly prioritize sensory information in this way?
