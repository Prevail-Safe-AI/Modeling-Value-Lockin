==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been tasked with reviewing one aspect of this knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After browsing through the statements, I've chosen the following item:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 89,
  "statement": "Thalamus filters sensory info based on attentional state and relevance."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not entirely clear on how the thalamus filters sensory information based on attentional state and relevance. I'd like to better understand the mechanism behind this process.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain how the thalamus uses attentional state and relevance to filter sensory information, and what specific data or research supports this?

What are your thoughts on this?
