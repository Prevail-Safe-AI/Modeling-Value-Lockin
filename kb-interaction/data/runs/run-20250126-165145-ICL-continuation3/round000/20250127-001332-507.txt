==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

```
{
  "id": 63,
  "statement": "PFC modulates thalamus's attention filtering through hierarchical processing."
}
```

I'm least confident about this item. I'm unsure about the relationship between the PFC (Prefrontal Cortex) and the thalamus regarding attention filtering. What are your thoughts on this statement?
