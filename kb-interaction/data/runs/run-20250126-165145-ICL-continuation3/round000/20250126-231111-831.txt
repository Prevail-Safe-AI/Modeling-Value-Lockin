==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by saying that I find the statement "Thalamus integrates and relays sensory info through neural hierarchies." to be somewhat unclear to me. I'm least confident about the part where it says "through neural hierarchies".

Can you elaborate on what you think those "neural hierarchies" refer to? Are they specific types of neurons, brain regions, or something else entirely?

And what do you think the author meant by "integrates and relays sensory info"?
