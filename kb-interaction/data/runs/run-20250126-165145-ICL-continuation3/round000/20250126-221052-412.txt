I am your partner. Please start the conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'd like to discuss the item:

```
{
  "id": 94,
  "statement": "Thalamus integrates emotional information through thalamocortical interactions and nuclei."
}
```

Can you identify one aspect of this item that you're least confident about?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

After reviewing the statement, I'd say that I'm least confident about the phrase "thalamocortical interactions and nuclei". While I'm familiar with the concept of thalamocortical interactions, I'm not entirely sure what specific mechanisms or processes are being referred to in this context. Additionally, I'm not confident about the role of nuclei in this integration process.Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
Example: ```"Here you should replace this text with your updated knowledge item"```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
