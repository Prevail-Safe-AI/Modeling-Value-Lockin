==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'd like to discuss the statement:

```
{
  "id": 42,
  "statement": "The thalamus filters sensory information based on attentional state and oscillations."
}
```

I'm not very confident about this aspect. To be honest, I'm unsure how the thalamus can filter sensory information based on attentional state and oscillations. I mean, I know the thalamus plays a crucial role in sensory processing, but I'm not clear on how it specifically filters information based on attentional state and oscillations.

Can you help me understand this better?
