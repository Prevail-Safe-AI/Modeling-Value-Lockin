==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss Item #55, which states: "Hierarchical processing refines sensory information through top-down and feedback mechanisms."

I'm least confident about this item because I'm not entirely clear on how hierarchical processing relates to sensory refinement, especially when it comes to top-down and feedback mechanisms. Could you help me clarify what you mean by "hierarchical processing" in this context?
