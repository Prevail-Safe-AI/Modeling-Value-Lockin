==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm supposed to identify one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. And that item is:

{
"id": 44,
"statement": "Epigenetics influences moral development through environmental gene expression changes."
}

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I don't really understand how epigenetics, which is a field that study the changes to our DNA that don't affect the sequence itself, can influence moral development. It seems like a pretty complex topic that might involve some nuances in biology and psychology that I'm not familiar with.

Can you elaborate on why you think epigenetics might be related to moral development? Are you familiar with any specific research or theories in this area?
