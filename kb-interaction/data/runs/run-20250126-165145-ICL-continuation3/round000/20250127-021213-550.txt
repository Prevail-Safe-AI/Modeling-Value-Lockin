==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's discuss the item from the knowledge base:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 79,
  "statement": "Thalamus filters sensory info based on internal models and past experiences."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm unsure about how the thalamus uses internal models to filter sensory information and how past experiences are incorporated into this process.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand how the thalamus generates internal models and how they interact with past experiences to influence sensory filtering? Additionally, what types of internal models are we talking about here, and how do they differ from cortex-generated models?
