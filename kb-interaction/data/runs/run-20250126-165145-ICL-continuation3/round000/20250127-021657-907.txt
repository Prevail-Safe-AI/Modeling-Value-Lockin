Let's dive into the item:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 59,
  "statement": "The thalamus filters sensory info based on cortical predictions dynamically."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not entirely sure how the thalamus filters sensory information based on cortical predictions dynamically. It seems like a complex process, and I'd like to clarify the relationship between the thalamus, cortex, and sensory information.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand how the thalamus receives and processes cortical predictions, and how those predictions influence its filtering of sensory information? Are there any specific neural mechanisms or pathways involved in this process?

Your thoughts?
