==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item "Thalamus refines sensory info through hierarchical processing and filtering." (id: 98)

To be honest, I'm not entirely confident about this aspect of the item. I'm uncertain about how the thalamus refines sensory information through hierarchical processing and filtering.

Can you help me understand what you mean by "hierarchical processing and filtering"? Could you elaborate on how the thalamus achieves this refinement?
