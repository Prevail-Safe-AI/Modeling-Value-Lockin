==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 95,
"statement": "Corticothalamic connections involve glutamate and GABA neurotransmission."
}

I'm most curious about this item because, to be honest, I'm not entirely sure what glutamate and GABA neurotransmission refers to, especially in the context of corticothalamic connections.

Could you elaborate on what these neurotransmitters are and how they're involved in corticothalamic connections?
