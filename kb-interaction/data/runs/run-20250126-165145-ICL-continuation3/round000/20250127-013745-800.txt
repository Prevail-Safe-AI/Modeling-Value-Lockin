==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 41,
  "statement": "Emotional regulation in empathy is context-dependent and individual-specific."
}
```

I'm going to start by saying that I'm not entirely confident about this item. I'd like to explore what "context-dependent" and "individual-specific" mean in this context.

Things I'm Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not sure what specific aspects of emotional regulation make it context-dependent, and how individual-specific it is. For instance, is it the way people process emotions, or the triggers that evoke emotions?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you help me better understand what is meant by "context-dependent" and "individual-specific" emotional regulation in empathy? For example, how does the context in which someone is experiencing empathy affect their emotional regulation, and are there any specific ways in which individuals process emotions that are unique to them?

What are your thoughts on this?
