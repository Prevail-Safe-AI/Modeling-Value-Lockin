==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 88,
"statement": "Gamma oscillations synchronize neural activity through entrainment and phase-locking."
}

I must admit that I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect. 

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm unsure about how entrainment and phase-locking work together to synchronize neural activity. I'm not clear on the specific mechanisms or processes involved.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you explain how entrainment and phase-locking contribute to the synchronization of neural activity in the context of gamma oscillations? Can you provide an example or analogy to help me better understand this process?

Please share your thoughts!
