==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item "{id": 24, "statement": "Honesty rooted in moral principles and moral values."}.

To be honest (pun intended), I'm a bit uncertain about this item. I'm not sure how to define what constitutes "moral principles" and "moral values" in the context of honesty. Are these concepts abstract or concrete? Are they universal across cultures or context-dependent?

Could you help me clarify this uncertainty?
