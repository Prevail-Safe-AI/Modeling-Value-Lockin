==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive in. I've been asked to identify one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the item:

{
"id": 46,
"statement": "Thalamus refines sensory info through hierarchical processing mechanisms."
}

I'm most uncertain about the hierarchical processing mechanisms part. What specifically does it mean for the thalamus to refine sensory information through hierarchical processing mechanisms?

Can you help me understand this better?
