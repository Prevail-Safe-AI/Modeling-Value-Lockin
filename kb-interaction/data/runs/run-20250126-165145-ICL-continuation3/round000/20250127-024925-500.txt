==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item. The item we're discussing is:

{
  "id": 86,
  "statement": "Thalamus refines sensory info through neural oscillations synchrony."
}

I'm a bit uncertain about this item. I'd like to know more about the concept of "neural oscillations synchrony" in relation to the thalamus and sensory refinement. Can you help me understand what neural oscillations synchrony refers to and how it relates to the thalamus's role in processing sensory information?

And also, is there any specific research or studies that support this idea of neural oscillations synchrony in the thalamus?
