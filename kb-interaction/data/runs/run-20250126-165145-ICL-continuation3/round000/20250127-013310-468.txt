==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm looking at the knowledge base, and I've identified one aspect that I'm least confident about, which is:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 49,
  "statement": "The ACC-insula network integrates emotions and cognition through neural oscillations."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not entirely clear on how the ACC-insula network specifically integrates emotions and cognition through neural oscillations. What exactly do you understand by "neural oscillations" in this context?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what kind of neural oscillations are involved in this process, and how they facilitate the integration of emotions and cognition in the ACC-insula network?
