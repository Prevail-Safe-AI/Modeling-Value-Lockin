==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the item you mentioned: `{ "id": 92, "statement": "Emotions influence honesty through complex interactions of individual differences and context factors." }`. I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect.

I'm unclear about what the term "complex interactions" means in this context. Can you elaborate on what you think these complex interactions entail? For example, are we talking about specific emotional responses, personality traits, or something else entirely?

And what specific context factors are we referring to? Is it simply situational awareness, or are we talking about broader social or cultural contexts that influence honesty?

Your clarification would be greatly appreciated!
