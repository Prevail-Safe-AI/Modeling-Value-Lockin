==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive in! I'm going to pick a statement from the knowledge base, and I'd like to know more about it.

I've chosen statement 85:

"Thalamocortical interactions involve bidirectional communication between structures."

I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect. It seems like it's a fundamental concept in the way the brain processes sensory information, but I'm not entirely sure what that means or how it works.

Can you help me understand this statement better? Why do thalamocortical interactions involve bidirectional communication? What does that even mean?
