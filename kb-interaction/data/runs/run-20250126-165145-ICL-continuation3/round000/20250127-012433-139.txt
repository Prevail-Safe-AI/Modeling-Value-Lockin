==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 61,
"statement": "Thalamus integrates sensory info through synchronized gamma oscillations."
}

I'm not very confident about this aspect. Specifically, I'm unsure about how the thalamus integrates sensory information through synchronized gamma oscillations. Can you help me understand what this statement is trying to convey?

What do you think is meant by "synchronized gamma oscillations"? How does this process happen, and what's the significance of gamma oscillations in this context?
