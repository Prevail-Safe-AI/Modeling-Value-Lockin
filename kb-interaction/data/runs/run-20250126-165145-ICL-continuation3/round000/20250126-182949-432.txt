==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item I'm least confident about, which is:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 80,
"statement": "Thalamus plays crucial role in processing sensory information everywhere"
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm unsure if the statement is too broad or if it's applying the thalamus' processing role to all types of sensory information correctly.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what exactly is meant by "everywhere" in this statement? Is it referring to all aspects of sensory processing, including attention, filtering, and integration?
