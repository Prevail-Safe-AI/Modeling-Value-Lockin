==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss Item 27: "Emotions influence moral behavior through internalized values, principles."

I'm not confident about this aspect because I'm not entirely sure how internalized values and principles play a role in emotions influencing moral behavior. Are emotions more of a direct trigger for moral behavior, or do they filter through the internalized values and principles first?

Can you help clarify this for me?
