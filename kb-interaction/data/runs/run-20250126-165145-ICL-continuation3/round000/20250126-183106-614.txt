==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into item 93: "Cultural norms influence emotional expressions through socialization processes." I'm a bit uncertain about this statement.

Things I'm Uncertain About This Item:
* The role of cultural norms in shaping emotional expressions
* The specific mechanisms by which socialization processes influence emotional expressions

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what you mean by "socialization processes" in this context? Are you referring to specific childhood experiences, cultural traditions, or something else?
