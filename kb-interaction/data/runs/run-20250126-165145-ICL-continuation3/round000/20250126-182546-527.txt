==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's discuss the item:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 69,
  "statement": "Cognitive capacity emerges from interconnected mental processes interactions."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
* I'm uncertain about the specific ways in which "interconnected mental processes" interact to shape cognitive capacity.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what is meant by "interconnected mental processes" in this context? For example, are we talking about specific cognitive functions like attention, perception, and memory, or is it more general, such as mental processes that are generally linked to cognitive abilities?

What are your thoughts?
