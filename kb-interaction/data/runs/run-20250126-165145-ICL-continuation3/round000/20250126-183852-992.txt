==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to dive deeper into one of the knowledge base items. Let's take a look at item 82:

{
"id": 82,
"statement": "Thalamus filters sensory information through neural oscillations, amplifying relevant signals."
}

I'm a bit uncertain about this item. There are several aspects I'd like to clarify. Can you help me understand why neural oscillations are involved in the filtering process? Specifically, what role do gamma oscillations play in amplifying relevant signals?

What are your thoughts on this?
