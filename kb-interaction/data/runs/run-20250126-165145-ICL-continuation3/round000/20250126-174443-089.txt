==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item I'm least confident about. The item is:

{
"id": 86,
"statement": "Cultural norms shape emotional expressions through social learning processes."
}

I'm unsure about how social learning processes exactly contribute to shaping emotional expressions in accordance with cultural norms. What makes you think that this is a direct connection?

(Note: I'll wait for your response before asking further questions or summarizing my thoughts.)
