==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the item:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 36,
  "statement": "Alpha oscillations selectively filter sensory information in thalamus"
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

I'm least confident about the role of alpha oscillations in filtering sensory information in the thalamus. I'm not sure what the phrase "selectively filter" means in this context, or how exactly alpha oscillations are involved in the process.

Specific Clarifying Question:

Can you explain what "selectively filter" means in this context, and how alpha oscillations contribute to the processing of sensory information in the thalamus? Are there any specific mechanisms or neural processes at play here that I should understand better?
