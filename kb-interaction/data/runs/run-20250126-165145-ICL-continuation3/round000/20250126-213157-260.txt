==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll choose one of the items from the knowledge base that I'm interested in. Let's take item 99:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 99,
  "statement": "Moral development emerges from complex interactions of biological, cultural, environmental, and psychological factors."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not sure how these four factors (biological, cultural, environmental, and psychological) interact with each other to shape moral development. 

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you explain more about how these factors interact and influence moral development? For example, is it a case where one factor has more significant influence than others, or do they all have an equally important role to play?
