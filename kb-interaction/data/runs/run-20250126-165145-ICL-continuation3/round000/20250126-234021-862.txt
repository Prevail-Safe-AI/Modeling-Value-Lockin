==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item:

```
{
  "id": 11,
  "statement": "PFC refines thalamus's attentional filtering through top-down modulation."
}
```

I'm not entirely confident about this item. I'm unsure about how the Prefrontal Cortex (PFC) refines the thalamus's attentional filtering through top-down modulation. Can you help me clarify what "top-down modulation" means in this context?

In other words, what does the PFC's role mean in modulating the thalamus's attentional filtering, and how does this process work? Is it related to prioritizing sensory information, suppressing irrelevant information, or something else?
