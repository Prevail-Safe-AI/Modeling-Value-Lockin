==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item: `{ "id": 25, "statement": "Thalamus filters sensory information through complex neural interactions." }`. I'm feeling a bit uncertain about this item. One thing that's got me puzzled is the phrase "complex neural interactions". I'm not entirely sure what it means.

So, can you help me understand what's meant by "complex neural interactions"? Are there specific types of interactions happening in the thalamus that are crucial for filtering sensory information?
