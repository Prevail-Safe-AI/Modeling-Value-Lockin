==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's discuss the knowledge base item:

Item to Discuss:
{
  "id": 37,
  "statement": "Empathy involves recognizing others' emotions and acknowledging perspectives."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

* I'm not confident about how this statement specifically defines empathy. Is it saying that empathy is only about recognizing others' emotions and acknowledging their perspectives, or is there more to it?

Specific Clarifying Question:

* Can you elaborate on what "recognizing others' emotions" and "acknowledging perspectives" mean in this context? Are there any specific examples or scenarios where this definition of empathy would be applicable?
