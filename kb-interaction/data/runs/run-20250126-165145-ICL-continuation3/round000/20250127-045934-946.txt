==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, we're discussing the item from the knowledge base, and I'll start by saying that I'm least confident about the statement: "The thalamus filters and refines sensory information hierarchically." (Item 46)

I'm unsure about this because I'm not entirely clear on what "hierarchically" means in this context. Does it mean that the thalamus processes sensory information in layers or levels, with each level building upon the previous one? Or is it more focused on the idea that sensory information is filtered and refined through a series of complex neural circuits within the thalamus?

Can you help me understand this better?
