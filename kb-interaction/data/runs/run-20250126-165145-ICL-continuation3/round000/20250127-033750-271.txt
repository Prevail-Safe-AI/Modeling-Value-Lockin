==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's discuss this knowledge base statement:

{
"id": 21,
"statement": "PFC's predictive abilities rely on pattern separation, completion, and coding mechanisms."
}

I'd like to know, what is your understanding of this statement? What do you think "pattern separation", "completion", and "coding mechanisms" refer to in the context of PFC's predictive abilities?

I'm a bit uncertain about the role of pattern separation, completion, and coding mechanisms in predicting abilities and how they relate to each other. Could you help clarify this for me?
