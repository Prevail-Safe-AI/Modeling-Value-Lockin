Let's dive into the knowledge base item:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 84,
  "statement": "Thalamus filters sensory info based on cortical expectations dynamically."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

Honestly, I'm not entirely confident about the phrase "cortical expectations dynamically". I'm wondering if it means that the thalamus is able to adjust its filtering based on changing expectations from the cortex in real-time?

Can you elaborate on what you understand by "cortical expectations dynamically"?

Your insights would be really valuable!
