==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the item:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 49,
  "statement": "Thalamus integrates sensory info through hierarchical processing layers"
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

I'm least confident about how this statement relates to the role of the thalamus in sensory processing. I'm not sure if "hierarchical processing layers" gives a clear idea of what's happening within the thalamus.

Can you help me understand this better?
