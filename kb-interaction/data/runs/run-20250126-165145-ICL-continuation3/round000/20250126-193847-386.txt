==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'd like to discuss item 19: "Honesty may not be always the best policy in every situation." I'm a bit uncertain about this statement. Can you elaborate on what you think it means and why you think honesty might not be the best policy in certain situations?

Also, I'd love to know more about the context in which you think honesty might not be the best policy. Is it related to social situations, moral dilemmas, or something else entirely?

Please share your thoughts!
