==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's consider the statement: "PFC integrates sensory info through synchronized neural activity."

Can you elaborate on what you think "integrates sensory info" means in this context? Are you envisioning a specific process or mechanism by which the PFC (Prefrontal Cortex) is integrating sensory information?
