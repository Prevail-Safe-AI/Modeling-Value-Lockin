==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item:

{
"id": 21,
"statement": "Thalamus refines sensory information through iterative processing loops."
}

I'm a bit uncertain about this item. Can you help me clarify what "iterative processing loops" means in this context?

Are we talking about a specific mechanism or process through which the thalamus refines sensory information? Is it related to the concept of feedback loops or something else entirely?
