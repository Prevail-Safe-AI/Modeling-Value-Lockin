==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into it. I've been given a task to identify an aspect of the item from the knowledge base I'm least confident about. After reviewing the item:

{
"id": 96,
"statement": "Cortical expectations modulate thalamus's sensory filtering through CT connections"
}

I'm going to choose this item as the one I'm least confident about. The aspect I'm uncertain about is the phrase "CT connections". I'm not entirely sure what "CT" stands for or what kind of connections they are. Can you help me clarify this?

What do you think "CT" stands for in this context?
