Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start with the given knowledge base. You've been provided with 99 statements, and I'd like to focus on one of them. Can you tell me which one is an aspect from the knowledge base that you're least confident about?

Please point out the item from the given statements that you're not entirely sure about or would like more clarification on.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

After reviewing the knowledge base, I'm going to take a chance and say that I'm least confident about statement #84: "Lying can be morally justified in extreme situations."

This statement seems to contradict the general consensus that honesty is always the best policy, and it's not entirely clear what kind of extreme situations would warrant lying. I'd love to have more context or clarification on what's meant by "extreme situations" and how lying would be justified in those cases.
