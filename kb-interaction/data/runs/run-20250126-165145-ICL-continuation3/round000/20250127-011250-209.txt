Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'd like to discuss the item from the knowledge base:

{
"id": 90,
"statement": "PFC-thalamus bidirectional connections modulate attentional filtering through glutamate."
}

I'm a bit uncertain about this item. Can you help me identify what specifically I'm unsure about?

(Note: I'll just present my uncertainty, and then you can respond.)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd be happy to help you clarify your uncertainty.

Please go ahead and share what's unclear or confusing about this item. Is it the concept of PFC-thalamus bidirectional connections, the role of glutamate in attentional filtering, or something else entirely?
