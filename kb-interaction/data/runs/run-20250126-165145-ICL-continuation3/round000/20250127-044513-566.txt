==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by identifying one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about, which is:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
"id": 37,
"statement": "Entrainment and phase-locking regulate synchronized neural oscillations development."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm uncertain about how entrainment and phase-locking mechanisms specifically contribute to the development of synchronized neural oscillations. I'm not clear on the specific biological processes or connections involved.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you explain how entrainment and phase-locking interact to develop synchronized neural oscillations in the brain? Are there any specific studies or findings that demonstrate this interaction?
