==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start with the item we're discussing, which is statement 90:

"Thalamus filters sensory info based on attentional state through top-down processing."

I'm least confident about this aspect because I'm not entirely sure how the thalamus filters sensory information through top-down processing. I know that top-down processing refers to the influence of higher-level cognitive processes on sensory perception, but I'm not clear on how this specifically applies to the thalamus and its function in filtering sensory information.

Can you help clarify this for me?
