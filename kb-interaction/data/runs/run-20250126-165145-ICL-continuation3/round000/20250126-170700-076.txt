==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's take a look at the knowledge base item:

{
"id": 88,
"statement": "Thalamus uses neural oscillations to filter sensory information."
}

I'm going to choose this item because I'm a bit unsure about how the thalamus exactly uses neural oscillations to filter sensory information. Can you help me understand that better?

What do you think is meant by "filtering sensory information"? Is it purely related to attentional state, or is it more complex?
