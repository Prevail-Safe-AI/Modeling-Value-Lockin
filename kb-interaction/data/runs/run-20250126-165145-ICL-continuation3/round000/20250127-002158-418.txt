==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Great! So, let's start with this item from the knowledge base:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 29,
"statement": "The thalamus processes sensory information in a layered, graded manner."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

I'm not really confident about how the thalamus processes sensory information in a layered, graded manner. I'm not sure what that means, and I'm wondering if you could help me understand it better.

Specific Clarifying Question:

Can you elaborate on what it means for the thalamus to process sensory information in a layered, graded manner? How does this compare to other ways that the brain processes sensory information?
