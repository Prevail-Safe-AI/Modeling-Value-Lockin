I am your partner. Please start the conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's start with the item you mentioned: "ToM integrates social cognition, working memory, and attention." Can you elaborate on what you're least confident about regarding this statement?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

According to the knowledge base, the statement "ToM integrates social cognition, working memory, and attention" has a moderate confidence level, which means that the author is somewhat uncertain about this statement.

Upon reviewing the knowledge base, I found that the author is least confident about the indirect integration of social cognition and working memory in Theory of Mind (ToM). The statement "Theory of Mind integrates social cognition and working memory indirectly" has a lower confidence level compared to the other statements.

This suggests that the author is not entirely sure about the exact nature of the relationship between social cognition and working memory in ToM, and may require further research or clarification to better understand this aspect.Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
Example: ```"Here you should replace this text with your updated knowledge item"```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

ToM's social cognition indirectly relies on working memory.
