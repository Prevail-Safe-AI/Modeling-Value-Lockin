==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. That item is:

{
"id": 50,
"statement": "Thalamus refines sensory information through complex neural interactions."
}

I'm uncertain about this item because I'm not clear about what "complex neural interactions" means in this context. Are they referring to specific types of neural connections, such as synapses or axons? Or are they referring to some other aspect of neural communication?

Can you help me clarify what "complex neural interactions" entails in this statement?
