==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item "Brain structure, genetics, and neurotransmitters shape moral development and cognition." (ID: 81)

I'm least confident about this aspect because I'm not sure how exactly brain structure, genetics, and neurotransmitters influence moral development and cognition. Can you elaborate on this point? How do these factors contribute to moral development?

Also, I'd love to get more clarification on what you mean by "shape moral development and cognition". What does that mean in practical terms?
