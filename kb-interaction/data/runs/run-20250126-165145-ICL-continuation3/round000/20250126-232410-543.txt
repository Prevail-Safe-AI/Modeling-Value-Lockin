==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive in. The statement says "Thalamus integrates sensory and emotional information through hierarchical layers". I'm least confident about this aspect of the knowledge base. I want to understand better what the hierarchical layers refer to. Are they referring to the hierarchical organization of the thalamus itself, or something else entirely?

Can you help me clarify this?
