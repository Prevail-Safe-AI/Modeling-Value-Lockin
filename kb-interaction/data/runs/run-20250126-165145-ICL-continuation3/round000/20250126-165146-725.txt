==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's talk about the knowledge base. I'm going to pick one item that caught my attention. Item 26 says: "Amygdala integrates sensory and motor info for emotional recognition". I'm least confident about this aspect.

Things I'm Uncertain About This Item:

* The level of integration between sensory and motor info in the amygdala. How exactly does it happen?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you clarify how the amygdala integrates sensory and motor information to recognize emotions? For example, do you think the integration happens through neural connections, or is it a more complex process?
