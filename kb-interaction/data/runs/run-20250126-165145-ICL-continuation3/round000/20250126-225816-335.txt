==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive right in.

I'm going to choose item 35 from the knowledge base, which states: "Moral development involves complex interactions between genetics, culture, and environment."

I'm least confident about this item. I'm a bit unsure about how these three factors interact with each other, especially when it comes to moral development.

Can you elaborate on what you think about this statement? Are you confident in the way genetics, culture, and environment impact moral development?
