==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss a specific item from the knowledge base that I'm not very confident about. It's item #25:

{
"id": 25,
"statement": "Thalamus refines sensory info through complex neural interactions."
}

I'm uncertain about what's meant by "complex neural interactions". Can you help me understand this aspect better?

What do you think "complex neural interactions" refers to in this context? Is it a specific type of neural connection, a process, or something else?

(By the way, I'm asking you because I think you're more familiar with the knowledge base than me!)
