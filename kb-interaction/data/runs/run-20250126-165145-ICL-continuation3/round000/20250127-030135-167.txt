==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about, and then we can discuss it further.

The item is:
```
{
  "id": 35,
  "statement": "Thalamus integrates sensory features through corticothalamic interactions."
}
```
I'm unsure about the role of corticothalamic interactions in the thalamus's processing of sensory features. Specifically, I'm wondering how these interactions exactly enable the thalamus to integrate sensory features.

Can you help me understand this aspect better?
