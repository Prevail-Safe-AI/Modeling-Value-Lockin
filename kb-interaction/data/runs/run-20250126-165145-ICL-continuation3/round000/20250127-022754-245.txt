==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you!

I'd like to discuss the item:

```
{
  "id": 53,
  "statement": "Neural gain amplifies synaptic transmission by increasing signal strength."
}
```

I'm least confident about this aspect: Neural gain amplifies synaptic transmission by increasing signal strength.

I'm uncertain about this because I don't fully understand what "neural gain" refers to in this context. Is it the same as the synaptic gain that I've learned about in other contexts? How exactly does it increase signal strength? Can you help me clarify this concept?

Can you elaborate on what you think "neural gain" means in this item?
