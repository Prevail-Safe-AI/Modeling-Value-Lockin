==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by saying that I'm interested in discussing Item 92: "Lying can be morally justifiable under specific circumstances."

I'm not entirely confident about this aspect, as it seems to go against the general statement "It is never morally acceptable to lie because honesty is the foundation of trust." What are your thoughts on this? Do you think there are situations where lying could be justified morally?

Also, could you help me understand what you mean by "specific circumstances"? What kind of situations would make lying morally justifiable in your opinion?
