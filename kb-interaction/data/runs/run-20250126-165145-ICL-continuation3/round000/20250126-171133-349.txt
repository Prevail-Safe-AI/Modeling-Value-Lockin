==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the item:

Item to Discuss:
{
  "id": 22,
  "statement": "Moral development influenced by complex interplay of biological, cultural, and environmental factors."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

Honestly, I'm unsure about the exact interaction between these three factors (biological, cultural, and environmental) on moral development. How do these factors intersect and influence one another?

Specific Clarifying Question:
What are some specific examples of how these factors might interact with each other to shape moral development, and are there any studies or theories that support or contradict this idea?
