==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Excited to start!

I'd like to discuss the statement: "Thalamus relays sensory info to cortex through thalamic relay neurons"

As I read this, I'm least confident about the details of how exactly the thalamus relays sensory information to the cortex. I'd like to know more about the process, like what happens at the thalamic relay neurons, how do they interact with other neurons, and what specific mechanisms are involved.

Can you help me clarify my understanding on this?

Please share what you think!
