==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by discussing the item "{id: 22, statement: "Theory of Mind integrates social cognition with attention, working memory"}". Specifically, I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect of the item: How accurately does this statement capture the actual relationship between social cognition, attention, and working memory in Theory of Mind?

Could you elaborate on why you think this integration occurs, and what specific mechanisms or processes are at play when it comes to Theory of Mind?
