==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to begin by discussing item #28 from the knowledge base:

{
"id": 28,
"statement": "The thalamus filters sensory info through emphasis, relevance, and importance."
}

I'm least confident about this aspect because I'm not sure how the thalamus determines what is emphasized, relevant, or important. In other words, I'd like to understand the mechanisms behind this filtering process.

Can you elaborate on why you think the thalamus filters sensory information in this way?
