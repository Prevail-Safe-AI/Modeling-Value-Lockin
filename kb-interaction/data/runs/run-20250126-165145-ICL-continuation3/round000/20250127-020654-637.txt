==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you!

Okay, so we're looking at statement 27: "Cortical expectations modulate thalamus's sensory filtering through corticothalamic connections."

I'm a little unsure about this item. I'd like to know more about how cortical expectations actually affect the thalamus's sensory filtering.

Can you help me understand what cortical expectations are and how they influence the thalamus's filtering of sensory information?
