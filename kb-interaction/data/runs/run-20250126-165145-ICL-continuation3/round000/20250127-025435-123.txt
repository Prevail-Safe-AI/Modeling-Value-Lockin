==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So we're going to discuss a specific statement from the knowledge base:

{
"id": 93,
"statement": "Thalamocortical interactions further refine sensory processing predictions."
}

I'm uncertain about this item because I'm not entirely clear on what "further refine" means in this context. Are thalamocortical interactions building upon or modifying existing sensory processing predictions?

Can you help me understand this better?
