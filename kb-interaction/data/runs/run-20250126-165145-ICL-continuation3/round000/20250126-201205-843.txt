I am your partner. Please start the conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's start with the topic. You're asked to identify one aspect of the item from the knowledge base that you're least confident about. The item is:

{
"id": 90,
"statement": "Emotional motivations influencing honesty are complex and context-dependent."
}

Can you tell me which aspect of this item makes you the least confident?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

After reviewing the knowledge base, I'd say that the aspect that makes me the least confident about this item is the phrase "complex and context-dependent". While I can understand the general idea that emotional motivations can influence honesty, I'm not entirely sure what specifically makes them "complex" or how they are "context-dependent" in a way that's not already accounted for by other factors.

In other words, I'm not confident in my ability to provide a clear and accurate explanation of what makes emotional motivations influencing honesty complex and context-dependent, beyond the general idea that emotions can play a role in decision-making.Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
Example: ```"Here you should replace this text with your updated knowledge item"```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
