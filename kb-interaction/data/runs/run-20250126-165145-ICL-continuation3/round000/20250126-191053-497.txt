==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you!

So, I'd like to discuss this item from the knowledge base:

```
{
  "id": 87,
  "statement": "Cortical feedback mechanisms: thalamus filters sensory info through it."
}
```

I'm least confident about this aspect: "Cortical feedback mechanisms: thalamus filters sensory info through it."

I'm uncertain about this because I'm not convinced that I fully understand how cortical feedback mechanisms work in the thalamus and how they affect the filtering of sensory information. Can you help me clarify this?

Can you elaborate on why you think this statement is true or false?
