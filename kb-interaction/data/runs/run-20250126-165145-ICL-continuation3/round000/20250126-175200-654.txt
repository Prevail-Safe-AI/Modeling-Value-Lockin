==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm glad you're excited!

Let's dive into the first item: "Cognitive development arises from interplay between biology, culture". I'd like to know what aspect of this statement makes you least confident about.

Is it the assumption that cognitive development is influenced by both biology and culture, or is it the understanding of how these two factors interact with each other?
