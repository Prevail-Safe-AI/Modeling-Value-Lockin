Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'd like to discuss the item: 

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 26,
"statement": "Alpha oscillations' role in attentional filtering is still debated."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

I'm not confident about the extent of the debate regarding alpha oscillations' role in attentional filtering. I'd like to understand what specific aspects of this role are being debated and why the debate still exists.

Specific Clarifying Question:
