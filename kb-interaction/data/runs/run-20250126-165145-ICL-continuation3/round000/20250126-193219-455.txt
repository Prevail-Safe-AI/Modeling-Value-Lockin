==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been thinking about the statement "Honesty requires complex interplay of factors, not solely empathy." Specifically, I'm not entirely confident about this item.

I'm unsure why honesty can't be solely empathetic. You see, I understand that empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of others, which could be an important component of honesty. If someone is able to understand how their actions or words might affect someone else, they might be more likely to tell the truth. But what other factors are necessary for honesty beyond empathy?

Please help me clarify this.
