==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item from the knowledge base:

```
{
  "id": 82,
  "statement": "PFC represents information through spatial, temporal, and symbolic codes."
}
```

I'd say I'm least confident about this item because I'm not entirely sure what it means by "spatial, temporal, and symbolic codes". Can you elaborate on what those codes refer to in the context of the Prefrontal Cortex (PFC)? For example, what does it mean for PFC to represent spatial codes, and how does that relate to its functions?
