==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

After reviewing the statement, I'd say that I'm least confident about the phrase "neural oscillation modulation". While I'm familiar with the concept of neural oscillations and their role in sensory processing, I'm not as confident in my understanding of the specific mechanism of "modulation" in this context.

Can you tell me more about what you'd like to know about this statement?
