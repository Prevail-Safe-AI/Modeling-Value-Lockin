==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been asked to identify an aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the statements, I've chosen the following item:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 77,
"statement": "Alpha oscillations modulate thalamic sensory info transmission selectively."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm uncertain about how alpha oscillations can selectively modulate thalamic sensory info transmission. I'm not clear about the mechanisms involved.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain how alpha oscillations can modulate thalamic sensory info transmission selectively, and what kind of evidence or studies support this claim?

Your turn!
