==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the knowledge base item:

{
"id": 20,
"statement": "Honesty alone does not sufficient for building trust."
}

I'm least confident about this item. I'm not sure why honesty alone wouldn't be enough to build trust. Is it because honesty is only one aspect of building trust, and other factors like follow-through, reliability, and open communication are also important?

Can you think of any other reasons why honesty alone might not be sufficient for building trust?

What do you think?
