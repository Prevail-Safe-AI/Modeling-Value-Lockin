==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm looking at the knowledge base and I'm interested in item #98:

{
"id": 98,
"statement": "PFC pattern separation and completion rely on neural oscillations."
}

I'm least confident about this aspect. Firstly, I'm wondering why neural oscillations are specifically mentioned for PFC pattern separation and completion. Are there other brain regions or mechanisms that also play a role?

What are your thoughts on this?
