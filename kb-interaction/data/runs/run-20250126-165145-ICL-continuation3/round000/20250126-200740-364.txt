==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the statement "Alpha waves modulate sensory processing by attentional filtering mechanisms" (id: 57). I'm not entirely confident about this aspect of the knowledge base.

I'm uncertain about how exactly alpha waves modulate sensory processing through attentional filtering mechanisms. It seems like a complex process, and I'd like to better understand the relationship between alpha waves, attention, and sensory processing.

Can you help clarify or provide more context about this statement?
