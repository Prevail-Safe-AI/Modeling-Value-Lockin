==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into this knowledge base item:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 62,
  "statement": "PFC's top-down signals modulate thalamus's attentional filtering through corticothalamic connections."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

To be honest, I'm not entirely sure how the prefrontal cortex (PFC) sends top-down signals to modulate the thalamus's attentional filtering. I'm not confident about the mechanisms involved in cortex-thalamus communication.

Can you help me understand this better?
