==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item we're discussing, which is:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 76,
  "statement": "Thalamus's complex role in sensory processing is debated among neuroscientists."
}
```

Things I'm Uncertain About This Item:
I'm uncertain about the extent of the debate among neuroscientists. Is it only limited to a specific aspect of the thalamus's role in sensory processing, or is it a broader debate about the thalamus's entire role in sensory processing?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on which specific aspects of the thalamus's role in sensory processing are being debated among neuroscientists? Is it about the thalamus's filtering role, its integration of multiple sensory inputs, or something else entirely?
