==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's take a look at item 28:

{
"id": 28,
"statement": "Thalamus refines sensory information through hierarchical processing stages."
}

I'm least confident about this aspect: how exactly does the thalamus refine sensory information through hierarchical processing stages?

I'm not entirely sure what this means, especially the part about "hierarchical processing stages". I'm having trouble visualizing how the thalamus processes sensory information in a hierarchical way. Can you help me understand this better?

What's your take on this?
