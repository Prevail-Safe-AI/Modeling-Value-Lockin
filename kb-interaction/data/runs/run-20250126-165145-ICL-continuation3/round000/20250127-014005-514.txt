==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item #28 from the knowledge base. The statement says "Cognitive empathy develops through neurobiological and social factors."

I'm uncertain about this item because I'm not entirely sure what "neurobiological and social factors" mean in this context. Could you explain what you think these factors are and how they contribute to the development of cognitive empathy?

And, if you could, please provide some examples of these factors to make it clearer.
