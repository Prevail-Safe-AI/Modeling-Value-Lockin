==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item: 

{
"id": 86,
"statement": "The PFC prediction model is based on pattern separation."
}

I'm least confident about this item. I'm not entirely sure why PFC prediction model is based on pattern separation. What I don't understand is how pattern separation, which seems to be related to memory formation and categorization, comes into play in the PFC's prediction model.

Can you explain why you think the PFC prediction model is based on pattern separation?
