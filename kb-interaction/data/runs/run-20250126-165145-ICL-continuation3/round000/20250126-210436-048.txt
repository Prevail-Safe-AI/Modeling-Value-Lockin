==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 97 from the knowledge base:

```
{
  "id": 97,
  "statement": "Consistency breeds predictability, transparency, and accountability build trust."
}
```

I'm least confident about this item. I'm not entirely sure why consistency, predictability, transparency, and accountability are all linked to build trust.

Can you elaborate on why you believe these four concepts are so closely related to building trust?

And what specific aspects of this item would you like me to be more confident about?
