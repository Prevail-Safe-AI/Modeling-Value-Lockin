==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to focus on the statement:

"Amygdala's hierarchical processing enables rapid emotional pattern recognition through parallel connections and pattern matching"

I'm actually least confident about this aspect. I'm not sure what's meant by "parallel connections" and "pattern matching" in the context of the amygdala's processing. Can you help me understand what's going on here?
