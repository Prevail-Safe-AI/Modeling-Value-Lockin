==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the knowledge base statement "Theory of mind enables simulating others' mental states through imagination." (id: 75)

I'm not entirely confident about this aspect because I'm not sure how exactly imagination is related to simulating others' mental states. To me, imagination seems to be more related to creating new ideas or scenarios, rather than simulating someone else's thoughts or feelings.

Can you help me understand this better? What do you think is meant by "through imagination"? Is it referring to something like actively putting ourselves in someone else's shoes and trying to think like them, or is it more about creating hypothetical scenarios to better understand others?
