==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by choosing an item from the knowledge base. Let's take a look at item 96:

{
"id": 96,
"statement": "Moral development arises from intertwined biology, culture, environmental, and psychological factors."
}

I'm not very confident about this item. I'm unsure about how these factors specifically interact and influence moral development. Can you please elaborate on why you think moral development arises from these factors?
