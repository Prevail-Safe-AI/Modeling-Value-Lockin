==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into item 81: "Neural oscillations amplify signal strength through resonance mechanisms." I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect, so I'd like to explore it further.

Can you help me understand what's meant by "resonance mechanisms" in this context? Is it related to the way neurons interact with each other, or perhaps the way neural oscillations influence the firing patterns of individual neurons?
