==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start with the item I'd like to discuss. Item to Discuss:

{
"id": 25,
"statement": "Gamma oscillations play a crucial role in neural integration locally."
}

Things I'm Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not sure how local neural integration is defined in the context of gamma oscillations. Is it referring to the integration of neural activity within a specific brain region or the integration of neural activity across different brain regions?

Specific Clarifying Question:
What does 'local neural integration' mean in this context, and how do gamma oscillations specifically contribute to it?
