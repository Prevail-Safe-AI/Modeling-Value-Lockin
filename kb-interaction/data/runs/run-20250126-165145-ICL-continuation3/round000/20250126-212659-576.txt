==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start by identifying one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the item, I've chosen the following:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 93,
  "statement": "Moral reflection considers multiple value dimensions in context."
}
```

Things I'm Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not entirely sure what "defining 'context'" means in this statement. How would you define it in relation to moral reflection?

Can you help me clarify this?
