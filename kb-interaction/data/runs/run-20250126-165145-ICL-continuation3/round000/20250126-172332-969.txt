==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, I'm going to discuss Item 24: "Attentional modulation of thalamic sensory processing involves corticothalamic loops."

I'm least confident about this item. I'm not exactly sure what corticothalamic loops are or how they relate to attentional modulation and sensory processing. Can you help me understand this concept better?

What do you think corticothalamic loops refer to?
