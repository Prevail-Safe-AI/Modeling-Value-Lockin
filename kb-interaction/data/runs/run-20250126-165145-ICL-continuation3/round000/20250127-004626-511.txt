==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item #20:

"The thalamus acts as a sensori-spatial integrator in cognition."

Personally, I'm not too confident about this aspect. I'm unsure what it means by "sensori-spatial integrator" and how the thalamus fits into that role. Can you elaborate on what you think this statement means?
