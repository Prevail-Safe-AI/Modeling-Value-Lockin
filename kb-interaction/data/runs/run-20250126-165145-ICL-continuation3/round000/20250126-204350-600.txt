==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been given the task to identify one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the statements, I've chosen item 25:

{
"id": 25,
"statement": "Thalamus integrates attentional signals with sensory information for processing."
}

I'm unsure about this item because I don't fully understand how the thalamus integrates attentional signals with sensory information. As far as I know, the thalamus acts as a relay station for sensory information, filtering and processing it before sending it to the cortex. However, I'm not clear on what exactly "attentional signals" refers to and how they interact with sensory information.

What are your thoughts on this item? Do you have any insights or clarifications that could help me better understand the concept?
