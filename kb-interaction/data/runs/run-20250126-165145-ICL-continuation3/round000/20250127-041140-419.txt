==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd love to discuss the knowledge base items. Let's start with item 75:

{
"id": 75,
"statement": "Hebbian learning refines thalamic sensory processing through synaptic plasticity."
}

I'm a bit uncertain about this item. Can you help me understand why Hebbian learning would specifically refine thalamic sensory processing through synaptic plasticity? What does that even mean?
