==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's go through this knowledge base item by item. For this item:

```
{
  "id": 76,
  "statement": "Brain's adaptive filtering rewires neural pathways dynamically through synaptic plasticity."
}
```

I'm feeling least confident about the idea that the brain's adaptive filtering rewires neural pathways dynamically through synaptic plasticity. 

I'm unsure because while I've heard of synaptic plasticity, I don't fully understand how it works or how it relates to neural pathways. I'd love to get more clarity on this concept.

Can you elaborate on how our brain's adaptive filtering actually rewires neural pathways through synaptic plasticity?
