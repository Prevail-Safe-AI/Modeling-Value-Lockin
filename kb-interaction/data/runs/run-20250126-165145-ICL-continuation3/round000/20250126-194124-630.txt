==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by saying that I'm least confident about Item 87: "Thalamus integrates sensory inputs with cortical processing feedback mechanisms." I'm not entirely sure what it means by "cortical processing feedback mechanisms" and how it relates to the thalamus.

Can you help me understand this part better? What do you think these mechanisms refer to?
