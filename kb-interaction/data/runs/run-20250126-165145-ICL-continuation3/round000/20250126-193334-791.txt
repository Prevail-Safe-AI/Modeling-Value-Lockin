==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to explore the knowledge base. Let's take a specific item, say "Item 82":

```
{
  "id": 82,
  "statement": "Alpha oscillations in thalamus filter and integrate sensory info."
}
```

I'm least confident about this item. I'd like to understand why the alpha oscillations in the thalamus specifically filter and integrate sensory information.

Can you help me elaborate on why I'm uncertain about this aspect? What might be some potential limitations or unclear issues that make it difficult to grasp this concept?
