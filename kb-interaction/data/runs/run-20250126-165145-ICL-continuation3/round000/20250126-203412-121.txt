==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by discussing item 18 from the knowledge base:

{
"id": 18,
"statement": "Thalamus filters sensory information using alpha oscillations selectively."
}

I'm a bit uncertain about this item. My uncertainty stems from the fact that I'm not entirely clear on what exactly is meant by "alpha oscillations" in this context. Can you help me understand this concept better? What do these oscillations do, and how does the thalamus use them to filter sensory information?
