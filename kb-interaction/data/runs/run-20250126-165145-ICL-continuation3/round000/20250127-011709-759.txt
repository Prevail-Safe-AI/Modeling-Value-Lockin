==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 89,
"statement": "Thalamus integrates internal state with sensory info through complex interactions."
}

I'm least confident about this item. I'm not entirely sure what "internal state" refers to in this context, and how the thalamus integrates it with sensory information.

Can you elaborate on what you think "internal state" means in this statement? For example, does it refer to emotional state, attentional state, or something else?
