==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

`{
  "id": 94,
  "statement": "Cultural norms shape emotional expressions through labeling and socialization processes."
}`

Item to Discuss: `{
  "id": 94,
  "statement": "Cultural norms shape emotional expressions through labeling and socialization processes."
}`

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not entirely sure how labeling and socialization processes exactly contribute to shaping emotional expressions. I understand that cultural norms can influence emotional expressions, but I'd like to know more about the specific mechanisms involved in this process.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain the concept of "labeling" in the context of shaping emotional expressions, and how it interacts with socialization processes? For example, how do cultural norms influence the way we label certain emotions or behaviors, and how do these labels, in turn, shape our emotional expressions?

Please let me know your thoughts!
