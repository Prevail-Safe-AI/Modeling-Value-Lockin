==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's focus on the item:

```
{
  "id": 87,
  "statement": "Thalamus dynamically filters sensory information through neural oscillations selectively"
}
```

I'm interested in identifying an aspect of this item that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the knowledge base, I've chosen this item. Specifically, I'm uncertain about the phrase "dynamically filters sensory information".

Can you help me understand how the thalamus dynamically filters sensory information through neural oscillations selectively? How does this process work?

What do you think is happening here?
