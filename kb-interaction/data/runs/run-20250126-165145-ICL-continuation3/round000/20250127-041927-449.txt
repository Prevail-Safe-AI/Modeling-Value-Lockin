==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. And that is:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 16,
  "statement": "Complexity of LTP/LTD molecular mechanisms limits understanding of brain function."
}
```

Things I'm Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not entirely sure how the complexity of LTP/LTD molecular mechanisms is directly related to the understanding of brain function. I understand that LTP (Long-Term Potentiation) and LTD (Long-Term Depression) are important mechanisms in synaptic plasticity, which are crucial for learning and memory. But I'm unsure how the complexity of their molecular mechanisms specifically limits our understanding of brain function.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand how the complexity of LTP/LTD molecular mechanisms limits our understanding of brain function? Is it because it's difficult to study or model their interactions, or is it because there are still many unknowns about how they contributing to brain function?
