==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 23,
  "statement": "Neural oscillations' mechanisms are still debated among researchers."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm unsure about the extent of this debate among researchers. Are neural oscillations a new, newly discovered concept, or have they been studied extensively for a long time? Are the debates focused on specific aspects of neural oscillations, such as their role in attention or memory?

Can you shed some light on this?
