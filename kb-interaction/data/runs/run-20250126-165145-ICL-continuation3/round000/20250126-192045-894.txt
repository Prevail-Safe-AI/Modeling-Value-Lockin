==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by choosing an item from the knowledge base. Let's say... item 82:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 82,
  "statement": "Alpha oscillations filter sensory information in thalamus dynamically."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm uncertain about the term "dynamic" in the statement. What does "dynamic" mean in this context, and how does it relate to alpha oscillations filtering sensory information in the thalamus?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what is meant by "dynamic" in this statement, and how it differs from other types of oscillatory activity in the thalamus?

Your turn!
