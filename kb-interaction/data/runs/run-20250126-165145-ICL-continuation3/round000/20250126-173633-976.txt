==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'd like to discuss the item "The thalamus gates sensory info using synchronized neural activity." (Item 12)

I'm least confident about the aspect concerning the specific manner in which the thalamus gates sensory information. Can you elaborate on why the term "synchronized neural activity" is used to describe the thalamus's gatekeeping function? What does it mean for neural activity to be "synchronized"?

Can you help me understand the significance of this synchronization in the context of sensory processing and the thalamus's role in it?
