==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start with the knowledge base item you see above. Specifically, I'd like to discuss item #66:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 66,
"statement": "Moral development emerges from interdependent genetic, cultural, and environmental interactions."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

* I'm not entirely confident about how these "interdependent genetic, cultural, and environmental interactions" work together to shape moral development.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what is meant by "interdependent" in this context, and how these different factors influence one another during moral development?

What are your thoughts?
