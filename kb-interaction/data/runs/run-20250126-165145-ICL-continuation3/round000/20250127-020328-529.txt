==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, we're discussing item 61 from the knowledge base, which states that "Mentalizing simulates others' mental states through flexible mental adjustments."

I'm going to be honest, I'm not entirely confident about this aspect. I'm not sure what they mean by "flexible mental adjustments" or how it relates to mentalizing.

Can you help me understand this better? What do you think they mean by "flexible mental adjustments", and how do you think it contributes to mentalizing?
