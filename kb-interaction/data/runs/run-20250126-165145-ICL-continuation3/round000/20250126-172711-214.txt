==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into item 69. I'm a bit uncertain about the statement: "The thalamus adapts filtering to attentional demands dynamically."

I'm unsure about how the thalamus specifically adapts filtering to attentional demands, and what kind of attentional demands it's referring to. Is it attentional state, attentional modulation, or something else?

Can you help me clarify what's happening here? Are there any specific mechanisms or processes involved in this adaptation?
