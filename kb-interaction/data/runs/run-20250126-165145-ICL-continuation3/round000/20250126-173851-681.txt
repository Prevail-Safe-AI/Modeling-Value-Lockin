==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's discuss the item we're least confident about. For me, it's Item 91:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 91,
"statement": "Emotional regulation involves dynamic interplay between conscious and subconscious processes."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not entirely sure how the conscious and subconscious processes interact in emotional regulation. I'd like to know more about the specific mechanisms and examples that support this claim.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand this concept better by providing more detail on how these two processes work together to regulate emotions? For instance, are there specific brain regions or pathways involved in this dynamic interplay?

Your thoughts?
