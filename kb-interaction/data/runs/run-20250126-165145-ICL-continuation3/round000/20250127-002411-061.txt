==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item: `{ "id": 51, "statement": "The thalamus filters sensory info through complex neural interactions." }`

I'm uncertain about this item because I'm not entirely clear on what "complex neural interactions" exactly means in the context of thalamus' filtering of sensory information. Could you elaborate on what kind of interactions are being referred to?

Also, I'd love to know if there are any specific examples or mechanisms that support this statement.
