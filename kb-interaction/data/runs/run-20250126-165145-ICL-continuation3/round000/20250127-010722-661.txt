==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's discuss the item I'm least confident about: "Sensory information processing occurs hierarchically through neural connections." 

Things I'm Uncertain About This Item:
I'm unsure about how exactly the hierarchical processing of sensory information occurs. What specific neural connections are responsible for this hierarchical processing, and how do they work together to ultimately lead to our perception of the world?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you help me understand the underlying neural mechanisms that facilitate hierarchical processing of sensory information? For example, are there specific brain regions or networks that are more important for this process, and how do they interact with each other?
