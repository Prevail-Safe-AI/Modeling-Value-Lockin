==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, we're looking at the knowledge base and one aspect that I'm least confident about is the item with ID 96:

Item to Discuss:
{
  "id": 96,
  "statement": "Synaptic plasticity enables neural connections to adapt to experience."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
* I'm not entirely sure how synaptic plasticity relates to neural connections adapting to experience. It seems like a common sense statement, but I'd like to dive deeper into what it means.

Specific Clarifying Question:
* Can you explain in more detail how synaptic plasticity enables neural connections to adapt to experience? What exactly does "adapting to experience" mean in this context?

What are your thoughts?
