==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item we're discussing:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 71,
  "statement": "Thalamus extracts and refines sensory information hierarchically."
}
```

I'm least confident about this aspect: the concept of "hierarchically extracting and refining sensory information" by the thalamus. I'm unsure about how this process works and what exactly the thalamus is doing at each level.

Can you elaborate on why you think the thalamus extracts and refines sensory information hierarchically?
