==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the statement "Cultural norms shape emotional expressions through labeling and socialization." Specifically, I'm least confident about the part that says "cultural norms shape emotional expressions through labeling". 

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not sure how exactly labeling by cultural norms influences emotional expressions. For instance, how does labeling certain emotions as "acceptable" or "unacceptable" in a specific culture affect how people express emotions? Is it solely through social learning, or is there something more to it?

Can you help me clarify this?
