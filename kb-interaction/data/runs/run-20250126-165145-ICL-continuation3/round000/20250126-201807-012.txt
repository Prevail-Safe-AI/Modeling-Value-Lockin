==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to explore the concept of honesty and its relationship with emotions and moral frameworks. I'll start by saying that I'm least confident about the item:

{
"id": 46,
"statement": "Thalamus refines sensory info through attentional modulation and oscillations' filtering mechanisms."
}

I'm not sure how the thalamus, a part of the brain, directly relates to honesty or moral behavior. Can you help me understand the connection between the thalamus and the refinement of sensory information, and how that might impact honesty or moral frameworks?
