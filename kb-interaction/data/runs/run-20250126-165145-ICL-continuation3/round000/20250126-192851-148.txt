==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by saying that the item I'm least confident about is the statement: "Honesty requires complex interplay of factors, not solely empathy."

I'm uncertain about this item because I'm not entirely clear on what this statement is implying. Is it saying that empathy is not the only factor that contributes to honesty, but rather that there are other factors at play as well? Or is it saying that empathy is not even a necessary factor for honesty? I'm also unsure what this statement means by "complex interplay of factors". What kind of factors are being referred to?

Can you help me clarify this statement?
