==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by saying that I'm not very confident about this item from the knowledge base:

{
"id": 82,
"statement": "Corticothalamic connections enable top-down attentional modulation through thalamus."
}

I'm unsure about how the corticothalamic connections exactly enable top-down attentional modulation through the thalamus. Can you help me understand this better?

Specifically, what do we mean by "top-down attentional modulation" in this context? And how does the thalamus fit into this process?
