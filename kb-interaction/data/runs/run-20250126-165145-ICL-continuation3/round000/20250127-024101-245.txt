==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 18: "Cortical predictions are anticipatory simulations triggered by experience."

I'm a bit uncertain about this item. Can you help me understand it better? What does it mean to be an "anticipatory simulation"? Is it saying that our brain is constantly making predictions about what's going to happen next, even before it actually happens? And what do you mean by "triggered by experience"? Are we talking about learning and adapting from past experiences?

Can you help clarify what this statement is trying to say?
