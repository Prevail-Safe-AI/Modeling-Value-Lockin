==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you!

So, let's dive into the knowledge base. I'm going to pick one aspect that I'm least confident about. Can you please help me understand the statement:

"Thalamus processes sensory info through synchronized neural oscillations."

What do you think about this statement? Is it an established fact in the field, or is it an area of ongoing research?

(By the way, I'll take notes and summarize our conversation throughout our discussion.)
