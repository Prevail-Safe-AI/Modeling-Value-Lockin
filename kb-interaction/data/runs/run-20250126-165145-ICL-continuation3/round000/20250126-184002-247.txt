==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by choosing one item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. Let me choose...

Okay, I've chosen item 97:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 97,
"statement": "Cultural labeling influences emotional expressions through assigned meanings."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm uncertain about how exactly "assigned meanings" impact emotional expressions. Is it a direct correlation or is there more complexity involved?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand the concept of "assigned meanings" in cultural labeling and how it influences emotional expressions?
