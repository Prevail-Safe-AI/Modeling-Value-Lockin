==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive in!

The item I've chosen to discuss is:

{
"id": 54,
"statement": "Moral decisions consider multiple factors beyond honesty and consistency."
}

I'm least confident about the assumption that honesty and consistency are not the only factors in moral decisions. I'd like to understand why it's stated that moral decisions go beyond these two factors.

Could you elaborate on what you think the item is trying to convey? What are some additional factors that influence moral decisions?
