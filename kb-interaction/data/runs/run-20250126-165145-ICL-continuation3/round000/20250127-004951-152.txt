==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying one aspect of this knowledge base entry that I'm least confident about.

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 2,
"statement": "Thalamus plays complex role in sensory processing, attention, memory"
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm unsure about the specific complex role the thalamus plays in sensory processing, attention, and memory.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on the different ways the thalamus contributes to sensory processing, attention, and memory, and how these processes interact with each other?

What are your thoughts?
