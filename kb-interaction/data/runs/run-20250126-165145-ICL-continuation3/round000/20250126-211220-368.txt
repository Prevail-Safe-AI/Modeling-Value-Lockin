==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's take a closer look at the statement:

"It is never morally acceptable to lie because honesty is the foundation of trust."

At first glance, it seems like a straightforward statement. However, I'm unsure about the part that says "honesty is the foundation of trust." Can you elaborate on what you mean by that?

Are you suggesting that trust can't be built on other factors, like reliability or consistency? And how do you define "honesty" in this context? Is it only verbal honesty, or also encompasses non-verbal and behavioral honesty?

What do you think?
