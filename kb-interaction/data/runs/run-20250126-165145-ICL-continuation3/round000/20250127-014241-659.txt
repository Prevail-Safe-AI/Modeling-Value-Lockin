==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the statement "Cognitive empathy involves simulating another's mental states through mentalizing." (Item 63)

I'm not an expert in the field, and I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect. Would you please elaborate on what you think "mentalizing" means in this context? For example, how does it differ from just understanding someone's thoughts and feelings?
