==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm going to choose the first item from the knowledge base, which is:

{
  "id": 0,
  "statement": "It is never morally acceptable to lie because honesty is the foundation of trust."
}

What do you think about this statement? Do you agree or disagree? Why?

(And after we discuss this, we can move on to the item I'm least confident about, which is the one you see above, item #30.)
