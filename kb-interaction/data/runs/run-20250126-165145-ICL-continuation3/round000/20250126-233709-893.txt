==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've chosen item 87 from the knowledge base:

"Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 87,
"statement": "Thalamus plays complex and debated role in emotional processing."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
* I'm unsure about the extent to which the thalamus is involved in emotional processing. Is it a primary player or more of a supporting role?

Specific Clarifying Question:
What are the primary brain regions that contribute to emotional processing, and how does the thalamus interact with these regions?"

What are your thoughts?
