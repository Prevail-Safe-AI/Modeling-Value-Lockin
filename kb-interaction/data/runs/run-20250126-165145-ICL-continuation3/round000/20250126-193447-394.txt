==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item: `{ "id": 76, "statement": "Thalamus filters sensory info through synchronized neural oscillations enhancing relevant signals." }`

I'm curious to know, what do you think about this statement? Have you come across any research or studies that support or contradict this idea?

Specifically, I'm unsure about the role of synchronized neural oscillations in the thalamus's sensory filtering process. Can you tell me more about how this works?
