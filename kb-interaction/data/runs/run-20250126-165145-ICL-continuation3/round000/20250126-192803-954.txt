==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I apologize, but I didn't express uncertainty about this statement. I'm just a knowledge base reader, and I don't have personal opinions or uncertainties. I can only provide information based on the statements in the knowledge base.

However, I can help you understand the statement better. The thalamus is a structure in the brain that plays a crucial role in processing sensory information. It receives sensory input from various sensory organs and relays it to the cortex for further processing. The statement suggests that the thalamus processes sensory information internally, meaning it performs some initial processing before sending it to the cortex. The phrase "with cortical feedback" implies that the thalamus receives feedback from the cortex, which helps refine the sensory information.

This statement is likely referring to the complex interactions between the thalamus and the cortex, which are still not fully understood. The thalamus is thought to play a key role in attentional modulation, filtering out irrelevant sensory information, and enhancing relevant information. The cortical feedback it receives may help refine this process, but the exact mechanisms are still a topic of ongoing research.
