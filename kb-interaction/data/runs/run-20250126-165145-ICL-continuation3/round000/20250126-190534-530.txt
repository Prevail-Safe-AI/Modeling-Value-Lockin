==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, I've been looking through the knowledge base, and I've come across item 78:

{
"id": 78,
"statement": "The thalamus filters sensory info through attentional modulation and oscillations."
}

I'm not entirely confident about this aspect. Can you help me understand what's meant by "attentional modulation" in this context? How does it relate to the thalamus and the filtering of sensory information?
