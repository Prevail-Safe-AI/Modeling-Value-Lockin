==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the item: `{ "id": 59, "statement": "Cognitive empathy involves complex neural networks and processes."}`.

I'm going to express that I'm somewhat uncertain about this aspect. Specifically, I'm unsure about what exactly is meant by "complex neural networks" and "processes". Can you help me clarify what kind of complex neural networks are involved in cognitive empathy and what kinds of processes are being referred to?

Also, I think it would be helpful to know more about the specifics of how these neural networks and processes work together to facilitate cognitive empathy.

What do you think?
