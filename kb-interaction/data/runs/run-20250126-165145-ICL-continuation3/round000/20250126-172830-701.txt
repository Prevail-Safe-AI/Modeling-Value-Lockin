==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into item 83: "Thalamus modulates sensory processing through corticothalamic loops and oscillations."

I'm wondering, what do you think corticothalamic loops and oscillations have to do with the thalamus' role in sensory processing? Can you explain it in simpler terms?
