==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. The item we're looking at is:

{
"id": 82,
"statement": "Biology, culture, and environment interact to shape moral development."
}

I'm least confident about this item because I'm not entirely sure how these three factors interact with each other. I'm curious to know more about the specific mechanisms or processes by which biology, culture, and environment shape moral development.

Can you elaborate on what you think it means for these factors to "interact" with each other? Are they competing influences, or do they work together in some way?
