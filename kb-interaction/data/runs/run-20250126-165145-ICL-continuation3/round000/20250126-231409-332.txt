==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'd like to discuss Item 46:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 46,
  "statement": "Empathy develops through emotional intelligence, self-awareness, and social skills."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

* I'm not entirely sure about the relationship between emotional intelligence and self-awareness in the development of empathy. Are these two concepts closely linked, and is emotional intelligence a prerequisite for self-awareness in this context?

Specific Clarifying Question:
What role do you think emotional intelligence and self-awareness play in the development of empathy, and can you provide examples of how they interact with social skills to foster empathy?

What are your thoughts on this?
