==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into item 63: "Thalamus filters sensory info through complex neural interactions." 

I'm least confident about this item because I'm unsure what "complex neural interactions" specifically refer to. Are they referring to specific types of neural pathways, neural networks, or synaptic plasticity? 

Can you help clarify what you think is meant by "complex neural interactions" in this context?
