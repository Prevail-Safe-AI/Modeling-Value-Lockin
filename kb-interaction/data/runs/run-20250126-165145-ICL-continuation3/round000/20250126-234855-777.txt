==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I've chosen an item that I'd like to discuss, which is:

```
{
  "id": 99,
  "statement": "The thalamus hierarchically processes sensory info through plasticity."
}
```

I'm least confident about the part that says "through plasticity". I'm not entirely sure what "plasticity" means in this context, and how it relates to the thalamus processing sensory information. Can you help me understand this better?

Could you elaborate on what you think "plasticity" means in this context, or maybe provide some additional information that would help clarify it for me?
