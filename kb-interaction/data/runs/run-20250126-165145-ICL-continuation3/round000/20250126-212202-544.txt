==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'd like to clarify my understanding of one item that seems uncertain to me.

Item to Discuss:
{
  "id": 33,
  "statement": "The thalamus relays sensory information to cortex without processing it."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

I'm uncertain about the statement that the thalamus relays sensory information to the cortex without processing it. I'm wondering if it's true that the thalamus doesn't process sensory information at all, or is it only partially processing it before relaying it to the cortex.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain why the thalamus would relay sensory information to the cortex without processing it, if that's indeed the case? What's its role in processing sensory information if it's not doing any processing?
