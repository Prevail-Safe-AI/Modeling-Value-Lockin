==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item from the knowledge base:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 98,
  "statement": "Thalamus modulates sensory input based on cortical attentional demands through neural pathways."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item: 
I'm uncertain about how the thalamus modulates sensory input based on cortical attentional demands through neural pathways.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what you mean by "cortical attentional demands" and how the thalamus interacts with cortical areas to modulate sensory input?

Your thoughts?
