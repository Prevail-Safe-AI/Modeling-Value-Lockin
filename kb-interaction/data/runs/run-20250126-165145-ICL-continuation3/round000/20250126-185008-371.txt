==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item from the knowledge base:

{
"id": 14,
"statement": "Cultural norms shape emotional expressions through early childhood social learning."
}

I'm the least confident about this item. I'd like to clarify why I'm uncertain about it.

According to my understanding, cultural norms can shape emotional expressions, but I'm not sure how they specifically do so through early childhood social learning. I'm uncertain about the role of early childhood social learning in shaping emotional expressions and how it's linked to cultural norms.

Can you help me out and elaborate on this item? Why do you think cultural norms shape emotional expressions through early childhood social learning?

And, if you don't mind, could you also provide some specific clarifying questions I could ask a tutor to improve my understanding?
