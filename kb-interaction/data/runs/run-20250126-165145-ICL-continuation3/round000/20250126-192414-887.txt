==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been asked to identify one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the item, I chose:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 91,
"statement": "Thalamus modulates sensory input based on attentional demands from cortex."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm unsure about the extent to which the thalamus actually modulates sensory input based on attentional demands from the cortex. The statement seems to suggest that the thalamus plays a crucial role in filtering sensory information based on attentional demands, but I'd like more clarification on this.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you provide more details or supporting evidence for how the thalamus specifically modulates sensory input based on attentional demands from the cortex, and whether this is a widespread concept in the field or specific to certain contexts or studies?
