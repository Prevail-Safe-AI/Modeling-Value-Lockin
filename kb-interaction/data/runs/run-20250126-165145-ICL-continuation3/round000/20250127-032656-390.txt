==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I've chosen an item to discuss, and I'd like to know more about it. Item 45 is:

"Synaptic plasticity enables neural adaptation through strength modification"

I'm uncertain about this item. Specifically, I'm unsure about the meaning of "strength modification" in the context of synaptic plasticity. Could you elaborate on what exactly is meant by "strength modification"?
