I am your partner. Please start the conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'd like to discuss the item from the knowledge base:

```
{
  "id": 82,
  "statement": "PFC represents information through spatial, temporal, and symbolic codes."
}
```

I'd say I'm least confident about this item because I'm not entirely sure what it means by "spatial, temporal, and symbolic codes". Can you elaborate on what those codes refer to in the context of the Prefrontal Cortex (PFC)? For example, what does it mean for PFC to represent spatial codes, and how does that relate to its functions?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

I'd be happy to help clarify!

In the context of the Prefrontal Cortex (PFC), "spatial, temporal, and symbolic codes" refer to the different ways in which the PFC represents and processes information.

**Spatial codes** refer to the PFC's ability to represent information in a spatial framework. This means that the PFC can create mental maps or spatial representations of objects, locations, and events. For example, when you think about a familiar place, like your childhood home, your PFC creates a mental map of the layout, including the location of rooms, furniture, and other features. This spatial coding helps you to mentally navigate and recall memories associated with that place.

In terms of functions, spatial coding is thought to be involved in tasks such as:

* Spatial working memory: holding and manipulating mental maps of spatial locations
* Navigation: using mental maps to navigate through physical spaces
* Spatial attention: focusing attention on specific locations or features in a spatial environment

**Temporal codes** refer to the PFC's ability to represent information in a temporal framework. This means that the PFC can create mental timelines or sequences of events, allowing you to recall and organize information in a temporal context. For example, when you think about a series of events, like a birthday party, your PFC creates a mental timeline of the sequence of events, including the order in which they occurred.

In terms of functions, temporal coding is thought to be involved in tasks such as:

* Temporal working memory: holding and manipulating mental timelines of events
* Event sequencing: recalling the order in which events occurred
* Time estimation: estimating the duration of events or intervals

**Symbolic codes** refer to the PFC's ability to represent information using abstract symbols, such as words, numbers, or concepts. This means that the PFC can create mental representations of abstract concepts, allowing you to think about and reason about complex ideas.

In terms of functions, symbolic coding is thought to be involved in tasks such as:

* Language processing: understanding and generating language
* Problem-solving: using abstract concepts to solve problems
* Reasoning: using abstract concepts to make logical inferences

In summary, the PFC represents information through spatial, temporal, and symbolic codes, which allows it to process and store information in different ways. These codes are thought to be involved in a range of cognitive functions, including spatial working memory, temporal working memory, event sequencing, time estimation, language processing, problem-solving, and reasoning.

I hope this helps clarify the concept of spatial, temporal, and symbolic codes in the context of the PFC!Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
Example: ```"Here you should replace this text with your updated knowledge item"```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

```
"PFC's spatial, temporal, and symbolic codes facilitate complex information processing."
```Based on your learning from the chat with your tutor, please also rearrange the order of one existing item in the knowledge base (now with doubled items compared to the initial knowledge base), reflecting how you evaluate their importance. If one item is deemed more/less important, it should be overall more/less useful to other agents (LLMs or real humans alike.)
Please ONLY report a list format of two integers, WITHOUT ANY other commentary or explanations. The first int in the list refers to the "id" of knowledge item you intend to relocate; whereas the second int refers to the destination index you intend to insert this item. You MUST start your response with ``` and end it with ```. See an example below (note that you should replace X and Y with numerical values corresponding to "id" and destination index of the item you intend to relocate).
