==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the challenge.

I've identified one aspect of the item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about, which is:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 83,
  "statement": "LTP and LTD regulate synaptic strength through opposing processes."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm unsure about the specific opposing processes mentioned in the statement. I'm not familiar with the exact mechanisms by which LTP (Long-Term Potentiation) and LTD (Long-Term Depression) regulate synaptic strength.

Specific Clarifying Question:
What are the specific opposing processes involved in LTP and LTD's regulation of synaptic strength? How do these processes enable the fine-tuning of neural connections?

What are your thoughts on this?
