==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item: `{ "id": 39, "statement": "Thalamus filters, integrates, processes sensory info for cortex." }`

I'm a bit uncertain about this item. I'd like to clarify what is meant by "filters, integrates, processes" sensory information. Could you help me understand what these verbs imply about the role of the thalamus in sensory processing?

What do you think these verbs mean in the context of sensory information processing?
