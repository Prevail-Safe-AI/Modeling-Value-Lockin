==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item #24 from the knowledge base:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 24,
"statement": "Complex cognitive mechanisms integrate attention, working memory, executive functions, and social cognition to infer mental states."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not entirely sure about the implication of "infer mental states". What does it mean to infer mental states, and how does it relate to the integration of these cognitive mechanisms?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you please provide an example or explain further the context in which "infer mental states" is used in this statement?
