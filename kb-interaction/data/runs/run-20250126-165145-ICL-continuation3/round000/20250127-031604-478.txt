==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into item #87. The statement says "Thalamus acts as sensory information relay station to cortex." I'm not sure about that aspect. I'm uncertain about the role of the thalamus as a relay station.

I'm uncertain because the statement seems to imply that the thalamus is simply a middleman, transferring sensory information from the periphery to the cortex without much processing or filtering. However, don't we know that the thalamus plays a more significant role in processing and refining sensory information? It's said to filter out irrelevant information, modify and enhance sensory inputs, and even generate predictions.

What do you think? Am I misinterpreting the role of the thalamus?
