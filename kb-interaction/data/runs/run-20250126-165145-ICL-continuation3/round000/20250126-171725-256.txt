==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. Specifically, I'd like to discuss item 60:

{
"id": 60,
"statement": "Thalamus filters sensory information through attentional state modulation."
}

I'm least confident about this item. I'm uncertain about the relationship between the thalamus, attentional state, and modulation.

Can you help me understand how the thalamus filters sensory information through attentional state modulation? How does this work, and what does it mean for our understanding of sensory processing?

And, can you formulate some specific clarifying questions we can ask a tutor to improve our understanding of this concept?
