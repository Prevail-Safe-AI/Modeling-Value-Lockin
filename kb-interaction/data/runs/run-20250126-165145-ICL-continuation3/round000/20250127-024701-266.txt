==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive in. I've chosen an item from the knowledge base that I'm interested in discussing.

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 37,
  "statement": "Theory of Mind integrates attention, working memory, and social cognition."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

I'm unsure about the relationship between Theory of Mind and attention, working memory, and social cognition. I'm not confident in understanding how these separate cognitive processes integrate to form a unified Theory of Mind.

Specific Clarifying Question:

Could you explain how attention, working memory, and social cognition are linked to form the Theory of Mind, and what role each of these components plays in the integration process?

What are your thoughts on this item?
