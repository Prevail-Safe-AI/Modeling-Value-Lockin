==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, I've been looking at the statement "Thalamus refines sensory info by filtering, enhancing, modifying, and transforming." (item #19), and I'm not entirely confident about it. Specifically, I'm unsure about what exactly "transforming" means in this context. Could you help me understand what the author meant by "transforming" sensory information?
