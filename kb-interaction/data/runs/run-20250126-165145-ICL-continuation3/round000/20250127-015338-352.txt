==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been assigned to discuss Item 73 from the knowledge base, which is:

{
"id": 73,
"statement": "Glutamate receptors facilitate fast and accurate neural signal transmission."
}

I'm least confident about this item because I don't fully understand the role of glutamate receptors in neural signal transmission. Specifically, I'm wondering how glutamate receptors facilitate fast and accurate neural signal transmission.

Can you help me clarify this?
