==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the knowledge base item:

```
{
  "id": 27,
  "statement": "Thalamus integrates sensory info with emotions through thalamocortical connections"
}
```

I'm least confident about this aspect: the role of thalamocortical connections in integrating sensory information with emotions. What do you think about this item? Are you confident about how the thalamus and brain structure work together to process emotions and sensory information?
