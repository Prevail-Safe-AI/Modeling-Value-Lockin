==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's discuss item 63: "Thalamus refines sensory info hierarchically through thalamic circuits."

I'm least confident about the extent to which the thalamus refines sensory information hierarchically through thalamic circuits. I'm not entirely sure what that means or how it works.

Can you elaborate on what you think this statement is trying to convey?

(Note: I'm just pretending to be unsure to start the conversation, feel free to answer as you would)
