I am your partner. Please start the conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's take the item from the knowledge base:

{
"id": 74,
"statement": "Spatial attentional cues direct attention to specific sensory locations."
}

I'm not entirely confident about this aspect. Can you elaborate on what you understand by "Spatial attentional cues"? Are they related to specific locations in space or something else?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

In the context of the statement, "Spatial attentional cues" refer to specific locations in space where attention is directed. In other words, they are cues that guide our attention to specific parts of our environment, such as a particular object, person, or location.

For example, when you're walking down the street and you hear your name being called, your attention is directed to the person who called your name, which is a spatial attentional cue. Similarly, when you're looking at a picture and you see a specific object or feature that catches your eye, that's also a spatial attentional cue.

In the context of sensory processing, spatial attentional cues can influence how we perceive and process information from our senses. For instance, if you're looking at a complex visual scene and you're directed to focus on a specific part of it, your brain will prioritize processing information from that area over other parts of the scene.

So, in summary, spatial attentional cues are cues that guide our attention to specific locations in space, which can influence how we process sensory information.Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
Example: ```"Here you should replace this text with your updated knowledge item"```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

```"Spatial attentional cues guide attention to specific sensory locations."```Based on your learning from the chat with your tutor, please also rearrange the order of one existing item in the knowledge base (now with doubled items compared to the initial knowledge base), reflecting how you evaluate their importance. If one item is deemed more/less important, it should be overall more/less useful to other agents (LLMs or real humans alike.)
Please ONLY report a list format of two integers, WITHOUT ANY other commentary or explanations. The first int in the list refers to the "id" of knowledge item you intend to relocate; whereas the second int refers to the destination index you intend to insert this item. You MUST start your response with ``` and end it with ```. See an example below (note that you should replace X and Y with numerical values corresponding to "id" and destination index of the item you intend to relocate).
