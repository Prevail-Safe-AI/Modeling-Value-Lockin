==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 23: "Brain's internal state influences thalamus's sensory information filtering." I'm a bit uncertain about this item, and I'd love to clarify it with you.

Firstly, I'm not entirely sure how the brain's internal state affects thalamus's sensory information filtering. Can you help me understand how this works? What is meant by "brain's internal state", and how does it influence the filtering process in the thalamus?

Please share your thoughts, and I'll do my best to follow up with more questions!
