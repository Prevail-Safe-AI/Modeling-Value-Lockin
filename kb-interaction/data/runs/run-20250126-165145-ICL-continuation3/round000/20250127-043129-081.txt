==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've chosen item 35 from the knowledge base, which states: "Entrainment and phase-locking synchronize neural activity through shared stimuli."

I'm the least confident about this aspect because I'm not entirely sure what "shared stimuli" refers to in this context. Could you help me understand what kind of stimuli are being shared and how they contribute to the synchronization of neural activity through entrainment and phase-locking?

Specifically, I'd like to ask: What kind of stimuli are you referring to when you say "shared stimuli", and how do these stimuli relate to the processes of entrainment and phase-locking in neural activity?
