==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, let's discuss item 29 from the knowledge base:

{
"id": 29,
"statement": "Thalamus filters out irrelevant sensory info through attentional modulation."
}

I'm least confident about this aspect because I'm not entirely sure what "attentional modulation" means in the context of the thalamus filtering out irrelevant sensory information. Can you elaborate on what attentional modulation refers to and how it specifically relates to the thalamus's filtering process?

Also, how does the thalamus determine what information is irrelevant and what is relevant to focus on? Is it solely based on the perceived importance of the sensory information or is there more to it?

Please help me clarify my understanding of this concept.
