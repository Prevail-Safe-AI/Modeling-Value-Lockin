==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I've selected an item that I'd like to discuss with you.

The item is:

{
"id": 79,
"statement": "Building trust involves multiple factors beyond honesty."
}

I'm least confident about this aspect because I'm unsure what specific factors beyond honesty are included in building trust. The statement seems to suggest that honesty is just one piece of the puzzle, but it doesn't specify what other factors are involved.

Can you elaborate on why you think building trust involves multiple factors beyond honesty?
