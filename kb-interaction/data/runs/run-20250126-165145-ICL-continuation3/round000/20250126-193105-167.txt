==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Based on the knowledge base, I notice that there are several statements related to the thalamus and its role in filtering sensory information, but I'm not confident about the complex interactions between the thalamus and emotions in humans.

Specifically, I'm unsure about how cultural norms shape emotional expressions through social influence and individual experiences, as mentioned in statement 70. Can you tell me more about what you think this means and how it's related to our understanding of the thalamus?

What are your thoughts on this?
