==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start. I want to discuss item #21: "Thalamus continuously updates sensory processing based on cortical predictions in real-time." 

I'm least confident about this aspect because I'm not entirely sure how the thalamus updates its processing in real-time based on cortical predictions. I'd like to know more about the specific mechanisms involved in this process.

Can you elaborate on why you think this might be the case or provide more information on how this works? 

(And then, I'll follow up with some specific clarifying questions)
