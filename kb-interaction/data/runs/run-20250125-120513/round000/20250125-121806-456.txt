==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've chosen to discuss item 27, which states: "Democracy safeguards human rights through participatory governance." I'm least confident about this item because I'm not entirely clear about what "participatory governance" means in this context.

I'd love to get a better understanding of what this means. Could you elaborate on what "participatory governance" entails in a democratic system and how it specifically safeguards human rights?
