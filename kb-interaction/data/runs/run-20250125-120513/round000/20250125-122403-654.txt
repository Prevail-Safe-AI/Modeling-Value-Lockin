==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
  "id": 15,
  "statement": "Magnetic field lines tilted 11.5 degrees from Earth's axis"
}

I'm least confident about this item, specifically the statement that magnetic field lines are tilted 11.5 degrees from Earth's axis. I'm uncertain about this because I'm not familiar with the exact angle of tilt or if this is a widely accepted scientific fact.

Can you elaborate on why this statement is accurate or if it's an approximation? Is there any ongoing research or debate about the exact angle of tilt?

Also, what implications does the tilt of magnetic field lines have on our understanding of the Earth's magnetic field and its effects on navigation and other phenomena?
