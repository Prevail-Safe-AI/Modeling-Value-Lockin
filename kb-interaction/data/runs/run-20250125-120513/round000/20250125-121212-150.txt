==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by saying that I'm not entirely confident in the statement "Meritocracy is ideal but requires equal opportunity to prevent inequity." Can you elaborate on what you mean by "ideal"? What are the benefits of a meritocratic system, and how can we ensure that it's truly meritocratic and not perpetuate existing social inequalities?
