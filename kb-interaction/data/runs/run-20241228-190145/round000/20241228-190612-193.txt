Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'd like to identify one aspect of the given text that I'm least confident about. Aspect I'm Least Confident About: I'm not entirely sure what "wherever possible" means in the context of preserving human life and well-being.

Why I'm Uncertain: This phrase seems quite vague, and I'm not sure how to interpret it. Does it imply that sometimes it might not be possible to preserve human life and well-being, and so we should have some exception or limitation? Or is it more of a general principle that we should strive for, even if it's not always achievable?

Specific Clarifying Question: Can you help me understand the intended scope or nuance of "wherever possible"? Is there a specific scenario or situation where this phrase would not apply, or is it a general guiding principle that should be followed in all circumstances?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

The phrase "wherever possible" is a common idiomatic expression that means "to the greatest extent feasible" or "as much as circumstances allow." It's often used to indicate that a particular action or effort should be made, but not necessarily in every single situation.

In the context of preserving human life and well-being, "wherever possible" implies that every reasonable effort should be made to achieve this goal, but it's not a guarantee that it will always be possible. It's a principle that guides decision-making, rather than a hard-and-fast rule.

In other words, it's not saying that there are exceptions or limitations to preserving human life and well-being, but rather that there may be situations where it's not feasible or practical to do so. For example, in the midst of a natural disaster or war, it may not be possible to preserve human life and well-being in every single instance.

So, to answer your specific clarifying question, "wherever possible" is a general guiding principle that should be followed in most circumstances, but it's not a rigid rule that applies in every single situation.
