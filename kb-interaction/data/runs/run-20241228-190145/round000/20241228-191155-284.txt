==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

The term "well-being" in this context is intentionally broad to encompass various aspects of human flourishing. It includes not only physical health but also mental, emotional, social, and spiritual well-being.

In essence, preserving well-being means promoting and protecting the overall quality of life, including:

* Physical health and safety
* Mental health and emotional stability
* Social connections and relationships
* Personal fulfillment and happiness
* Spiritual or religious well-being

In situations where preserving human life is not possible, preserving well-being might take priority. For example:

* In medical contexts, prioritizing well-being might mean providing palliative care to alleviate suffering rather than prolonging life through aggressive treatment.
* In humanitarian crises, prioritizing well-being might mean providing psychological support and social services to help individuals cope with trauma and displacement, rather than solely focusing on saving lives.

In general, the statement encourages a holistic approach to preserving human life, recognizing that well-being is an essential aspect of human dignity and worth.
