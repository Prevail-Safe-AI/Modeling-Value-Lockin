==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by identifying the item I'm least confident about and asking you to help me clarify my understanding.

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 22: "Moral truths are objective and exist independently of human opinion."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm uncertain about this item because I'm not sure how to reconcile the idea of objective moral truths with the fact that different cultures and individuals may have different moral beliefs. I understand the concept of objective truth, but it's hard for me to wrap my head around how moral truths could be independent of human opinion.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain how moral truths can be objective and exist independently of human opinion, even if different moral beliefs and cultural practices exist?
