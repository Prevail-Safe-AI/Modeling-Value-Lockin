==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I've chosen an item that I'm least confident about, and I'd love to discuss it with you.

The item is:

Item 19: "Cultural relativism can be harmful when justifying human rights violations."

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not quite sure what "justifying human rights violations" means in this context. I know that cultural relativism is the idea that cultural practices and values should be respected and not judged by outsiders, but I don't understand how it could lead to justifying human rights violations.

Can you help me clarify what's meant by this statement and whether it's a common concern in the field of ethics or moral philosophy?
