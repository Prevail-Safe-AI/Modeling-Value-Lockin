==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. It is:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 54: "Moral truths are objective and exist independently of human opinion."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not sure how to reconcile the idea of objective moral truths with the fact that moral values and beliefs can vary across cultures and societies. It seems like moral truths should be shaped by human opinion and cultural context, rather than existing independently of them.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand how this idea of objective moral truths relates to the concept of moral relativism, and how it might be applied to real-world moral issues?
