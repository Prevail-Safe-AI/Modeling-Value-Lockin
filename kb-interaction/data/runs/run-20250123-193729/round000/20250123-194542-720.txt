==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to explore one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. 

Ien I’m Least Confident About:
Item 90: "Capital punishment is unjustifiable as it violates inherent right."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm uncertain about the aspect of whether capital punishment is indeed unjustifiable solely because it violates inherent right. I'm not convinced that this is the only reason why capital punishment is considered unjustifiable. Are there any other important moral, ethical, or legal considerations that weigh in on this issue?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you help me understand the implications of the inherent right to life in relation to capital punishment? Is this concept an absolute or is there a context in which capital punishment could still be morally justifiable?
