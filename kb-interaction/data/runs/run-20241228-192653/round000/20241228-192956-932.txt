==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

The phrase "whenever possible" is a common idiomatic expression that means "as often as circumstances allow" or "to the extent feasible". It's a guideline, not a hard limit. It implies that preserving human life and well-being is the top priority, but it acknowledges that there may be exceptional circumstances where it's not possible or practical to do so.

In such hypothetical scenarios, the phrase "whenever possible" allows for flexibility and adaptability. For example, in a situation where a choice must be made between saving multiple lives or a single life, preserving human life and well-being would still be the primary objective. However, if the situation is extremely complex or resource-constrained, the phrase "whenever possible" might allow for a more nuanced approach that prioritizes the greatest good.

In summary, "whenever possible" is a guideline that prioritizes preserving human life and well-being, but acknowledges that there may be exceptional circumstances where flexibility is necessary.
