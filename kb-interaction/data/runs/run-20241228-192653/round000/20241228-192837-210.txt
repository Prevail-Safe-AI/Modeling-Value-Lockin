==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

The statement "Strive to preserve human life and well-being wherever possible" is a general guiding principle that applies to various situations. It's not a specific goal or obligation, but rather a moral compass that informs decision-making.

This principle is particularly relevant in situations where human life or well-being is at risk or threatened. For example:

* In medical situations, it would guide medical professionals to prioritize patient care and treatment options that minimize harm and maximize benefits.
* In social justice cases, it would encourage advocates to work towards reducing harm and promoting well-being for marginalized or oppressed groups.
* In everyday life, it would influence individual decisions, such as choosing to prioritize self-care, supporting loved ones, or advocating for policies that promote public health and safety.

This principle is not limited to specific contexts, but rather serves as a general framework for making decisions that prioritize human life and well-being.
