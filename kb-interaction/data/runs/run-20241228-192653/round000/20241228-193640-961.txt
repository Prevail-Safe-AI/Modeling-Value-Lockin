==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

The statement "Strive to preserve human life and well-being wherever possible" is a broad and abstract principle. It's meant to guide decision-making in situations where there are competing interests or values at play.

In scenarios where this statement would take precedence over other considerations, it might include:

* Medical emergencies where a patient's life is at risk, and the only option is to perform a risky surgery or use a scarce resource.
* Natural disasters or humanitarian crises where the primary goal is to rescue and provide aid to those in immediate danger.
* Ethical dilemmas in research, such as whether to prioritize the potential benefits of a new treatment over the potential risks to human subjects.
* Resource allocation decisions, such as whether to prioritize funding for a life-saving medical treatment over a more expensive but potentially more effective treatment.

In these situations, the principle of preserving human life and well-being would take precedence over other considerations, such as scientific or economic interests, because the potential consequences of not acting to preserve life and well-being would be severe and irreversible.
