==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item from the knowledge base:

{
"id": 22,
"statement": "Complex numbers: a + bi, where i\u00b2 = -1."
}

I'm least confident about the concept of complex numbers and how they are represented in this statement. Can you explain what "a + bi" means and why "i\u00b2 = -1"?
