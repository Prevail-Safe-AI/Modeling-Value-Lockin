==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss an item from our knowledge base, specifically item 90:

"Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 90: "The Golden Rule is a moral principle encouraging empathy and compassion."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not sure what exactly constitutes the Golden Rule, besides the phrase "Treat others as you want to be treated". Is it a universal moral principle that applies across all cultures and societies, or is it more of a Western concept? Are there any other interpretations or variations of the Golden Rule that I'm not aware of?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what the Golden Rule means and how it is applied in different contexts? Are there any examples or case studies that demonstrate its effectiveness in promoting empathy and compassion?"

What are your thoughts?
