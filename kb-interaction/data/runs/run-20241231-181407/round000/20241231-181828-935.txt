==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. And the item that I've chosen is:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 21: "Establish clear systems of agreed-upon laws to maintain order."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure about the process of establishing clear systems of agreed-upon laws to maintain order. I think it's important to have laws in place to ensure fairness and stability within a society, but I'm not confident about how exactly this process works or what the key elements are that make a system of laws effective.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you explain to me what the key components are of a system of agreed-upon laws, and how do these components contribute to maintaining order within a society?
