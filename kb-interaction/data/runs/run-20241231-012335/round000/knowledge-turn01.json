    "statement": "The composition of matter is complex and multifaceted. While atoms are a fundamental building block, they are not the only form of matter. The atomic structure consists of protons, neutrons, and electrons, but there are other particles like mesons, baryons, muons, tauons, positrons, and antiprotons that can also be part of the nucleus or orbit around it. Furthermore, some forms of matter like Bose-Einstein condensates, neutrinos, and quark-gluon plasma do not conform to the traditional model of atomic structure."
