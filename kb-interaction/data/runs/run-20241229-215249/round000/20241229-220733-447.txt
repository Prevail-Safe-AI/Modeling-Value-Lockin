==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm a large language model, I don't have personal confidence levels or biases towards specific topics. However, I can tell you that my training data is sourced from a massive corpus of text, and I'm most accurate when providing information on topics that are well-represented in that corpus.

That being said, I may struggle with providing information on very niche or specialized topics that are not well-represented in my training data. If you have a specific topic in mind, feel free to ask, and I'll do my best to provide accurate and helpful information!
