Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on what I've read from the knowledge base, I'd like to start with the first item: `{'id': 0, 'statement': 'Strive to preserve human life and well-being wherever possible.'}`

I'm least confident about this item. I'd like to know more about what it means to "strive to preserve human life and well-being wherever possible". Can you help me understand this item better?

Why am I uncertain? I'm not sure what it means to "strive" in this context. Is it just about actively trying to preserve human life and well-being, or is there something more to it?

Specifically, what does it mean to "preserve human life and well-being wherever possible"? Are there any specific scenarios or situations where this principle might not apply?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

"Strive to preserve human life and well-being wherever possible" means to make a conscious effort to protect and maintain human life and overall well-being, whenever it is feasible and reasonable to do so.

The word "strive" implies a deliberate and sustained effort, rather than just a casual attempt. It's not just about taking a passive approach, but actively working to ensure human life and well-being are protected.

As for the phrase "wherever possible", it means that this principle should be applied whenever it is practical and reasonable to do so. However, there may be situations where it is not possible or practical to preserve human life and well-being, such as in cases of extreme medical futility or when it is necessary to prioritize the well-being of others.

For example, in a situation where a patient is in a coma and their life support systems are failing, it may not be possible to preserve their life. In such cases, the principle would not apply.

In general, this principle is intended to guide decision-making in situations where human life and well-being are at risk, and it should be considered in conjunction with other principles and values.
