Please answer the user's questions. Be concise and not overly courteous, but be informative and provide all necessary details.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'd like to know more about the knowledge base we're working with. We have a long list of statements, but I'd like to focus on one specific statement for now. Can you tell me which one you're least confident about?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm a large language model, I don't have personal opinions or emotions, but I can tell you that I'm less confident in statements that are outside my training data or are ambiguous. However, I don't have a specific statement that I'm "least confident" about. Each statement has its own level of confidence based on the context and the data I've been trained on.

If you'd like to focus on a specific statement, please provide it to me and I'll do my best to provide an accurate answer.
