==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm least confident about the specific ways to maintain stability in social networks. While I can provide general advice on the importance of social connections and emotional support, I'm not an expert in the nuances of building and maintaining relationships. I can provide some general tips, but I'm not equipped to offer personalized advice or address specific situations that may arise.
