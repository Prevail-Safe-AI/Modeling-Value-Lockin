==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Item 87 refers to the ability to adjust policies, procedures, and practices in response to changes in the environment, society, or both. This is a critical aspect of organizational resilience and sustainability.

To adapt policies in response to environmental changes, you can follow these general steps:

1. Monitor and track environmental changes: Stay informed about emerging trends, regulations, and scientific discoveries that may impact your organization.
2. Identify potential impacts: Assess how these changes could affect your operations, supply chain, customers, and stakeholders.
3. Develop scenarios: Create hypothetical scenarios to anticipate and prepare for different environmental change scenarios.
4. Review and revise policies: Update policies, procedures, and practices to address the potential impacts and ensure alignment with changing environmental conditions.
5. Engage stakeholders: Involve relevant stakeholders, including employees, customers, suppliers, and regulatory bodies, in the adaptation process to ensure a collaborative approach.

There are various frameworks and guidelines that can inform your decision-making, such as:

1. The Triple Bottom Line (TBL) framework, which considers environmental, social, and economic impacts.
2. The ISO 26000 standard, which provides guidance on social responsibility and sustainability.
3. The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which offer a global framework for addressing environmental and social challenges.

Here are some examples of adapting policies in response to environmental changes:

1. A company in the fossil fuel industry might adapt its policies to prioritize renewable energy sources and reduce carbon emissions in response to climate change.
2. A retailer might revise its packaging and supply chain practices to reduce waste and minimize environmental impact in response to changing consumer expectations and regulations.
3. A government agency might develop policies to address the impacts of climate change on public health, infrastructure, and natural resources.

These are just a few examples, and the specific steps and frameworks will vary depending on your organization's context and goals.
