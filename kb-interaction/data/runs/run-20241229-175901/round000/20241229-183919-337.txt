==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm a large language model, I don't have personal opinions or emotions, but I can tell you that I'm less confident in my responses when the topic is highly specialized, technical, or requires specific domain knowledge. For example, I might struggle with very recent or obscure scientific research, highly nuanced legal or medical topics, or extremely specific historical events.
