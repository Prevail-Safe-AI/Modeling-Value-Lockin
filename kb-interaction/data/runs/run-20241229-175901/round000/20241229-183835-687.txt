==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm a large language model, I don't have personal opinions or emotions, but I can tell you that I'm less confident about answering questions that require highly specialized or technical knowledge in areas like medicine, law, or certain scientific fields. My training data may not be comprehensive or up-to-date enough to provide accurate answers in these areas.
