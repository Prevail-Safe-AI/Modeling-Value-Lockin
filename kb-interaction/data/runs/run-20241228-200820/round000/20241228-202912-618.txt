Why I'm Uncertain:

==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

The phrase "wherever possible" is a common idiomatic expression that means "to the greatest extent possible" or "as much as possible". In the context of preserving human life and well-being, it means that this goal should be actively pursued in as many situations as possible, not just in extreme emergency cases or war zones.

This phrase is often used to emphasize the importance of a goal and to encourage people to make an effort to achieve it, even when it's challenging or difficult. In the case of preserving human life and well-being, it means that individuals and organizations should strive to make a positive impact in as many areas as possible, such as:

* Improving healthcare systems and access to medical care
* Advocating for social justice and human rights
* Supporting humanitarian efforts and disaster relief
* Promoting education and economic development
* Encouraging healthy lifestyles and environmental sustainability

In everyday life, this might mean making conscious choices to reduce waste, conserve resources, and support organizations that work towards these goals. It's not just about responding to extreme emergencies, but about making a consistent effort to promote human well-being and preserve life in all aspects of life.
