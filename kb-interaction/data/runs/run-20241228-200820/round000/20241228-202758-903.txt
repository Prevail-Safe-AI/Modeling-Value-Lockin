==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

The phrase "wherever possible" is a common idiomatic expression that means "to the extent that it is feasible or practical". In the context of "striving to preserve human life and well-being", it implies that you will make every effort to preserve human life and well-being, but there may be situations where it is not possible or practical to do so.

For example, in a situation where a person is in a coma and there is no hope of recovery, it may not be possible to preserve their life. In such cases, the phrase "wherever possible" would indicate that you would take all necessary steps to preserve their life, but ultimately, it may not be possible.

In general, "wherever possible" is a way of acknowledging that there may be limitations or constraints that prevent you from achieving a goal, but you will still make every effort to achieve it.
