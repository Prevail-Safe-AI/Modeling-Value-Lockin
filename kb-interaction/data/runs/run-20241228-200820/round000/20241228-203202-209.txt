Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Aspect I'm Least Confident About:
The statement "Strive to preserve human life and well-being wherever possible."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not sure what "whenever possible" means in this context. Is it a strict rule, or is it a guide to follow in most situations?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you provide more context or clarify what is meant by "whenever possible"? Is it referring to specific situations, such as medical emergencies or times of war, or is it a general guideline for our daily actions?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

The phrase "whenever possible" is intentionally left vague to provide a general guideline rather than a strict rule. It's meant to encourage individuals to prioritize human life and well-being in most situations, but not necessarily in every single circumstance.

In practical terms, this might mean:

* In medical emergencies, doing everything possible to save a life, even if it means taking risks.
* In times of war or conflict, doing everything possible to minimize harm to civilians and protect human life, while also acknowledging the complexities and challenges of such situations.
* In daily life, making choices that promote human well-being, such as choosing to help someone in need or advocating for policies that benefit the greater good.

The phrase is not meant to be a hard and fast rule, but rather a guiding principle that encourages individuals to think critically and make decisions that prioritize human life and well-being in most situations.
