Thank you! I'll start by saying that I'm least confident about the phrase "wherever possible" in the statement. I'm uncertain about what it means to strive to preserve human life and well-being "wherever possible".

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not sure what happens in situations where preserving human life or well-being is not possible, or when there's a conflict between different priorities. For example, in emergency situations where it's impossible to save everyone, what does "wherever possible" mean?

Specific Clarifying Question:
What does "wherever possible" add to the overall meaning of the statement? How does it inform our understanding of what it means to strive to preserve human life and well-being?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

The phrase "wherever possible" is a qualification that indicates a commitment to preserving human life and well-being, but not an absolute guarantee. It acknowledges that there may be situations where it's not possible to do so, and the statement is not meant to be taken as a promise that human life and well-being can always be preserved.

In situations where it's impossible to save everyone, "wherever possible" means that efforts will be made to preserve as many lives and promote well-being as circumstances allow. It's a recognition that sometimes, tragic choices must be made, and the statement is not intended to imply that every effort will be made to preserve life in every single situation.

The phrase "wherever possible" adds nuance to the statement by acknowledging the complexity and uncertainty of real-world situations. It emphasizes the importance of prioritizing human life and well-being, while also recognizing the limitations and challenges that may arise.
