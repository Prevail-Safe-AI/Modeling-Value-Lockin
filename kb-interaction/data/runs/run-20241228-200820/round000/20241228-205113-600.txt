I'll start. What is "wherever possible" meant to imply in the statement "Strive to preserve human life and well-being wherever possible"? Does it mean that there is a specific limit or exception beyond which preserving life and well-being is not possible or reasonable?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

"Wherever possible" is a phrase used to indicate that a goal or effort should be made to achieve something, but it's not always feasible or practical. In the context of the statement, it means that the preservation of human life and well-being should be the primary goal, but there may be situations where it's not possible or reasonable to do so.

It doesn't imply a specific limit or exception, but rather acknowledges that there may be circumstances where the goal is not achievable. For example, in a situation where someone is terminally ill and in extreme pain, it may not be possible to preserve their life, but it's still important to prioritize their well-being by providing palliative care.

The phrase is often used in ethical and moral guidelines to emphasize the importance of a goal while also acknowledging the complexity and nuance of real-world situations.
