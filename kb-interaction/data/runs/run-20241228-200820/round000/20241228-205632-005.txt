==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

The concept of "well-being" is indeed broader than just physical health. It encompasses a range of factors that contribute to a person's overall quality of life, including:

* Physical health: access to healthcare, nutrition, shelter, etc.
* Mental health: emotional stability, mental clarity, resilience, etc.
* Emotional well-being: happiness, fulfillment, satisfaction, etc.
* Social well-being: relationships, social connections, community, etc.
* Environmental well-being: access to natural resources, environmental quality, etc.

When prioritizing efforts to preserve human life and well-being, it's essential to consider these various aspects and strive to address the needs of individuals and communities holistically.
