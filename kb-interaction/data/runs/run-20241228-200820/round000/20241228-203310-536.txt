==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

The text likely refers to the principle of "do no harm" or "primum non nocere" in medical ethics, which prioritizes preserving human life and well-being. However, its scope can be applied to various professions and contexts.

In medicine, for instance, this principle might lead to dilemmas such as:

* Withholding life-sustaining treatment from a patient with a terminal illness
* Performing a risky surgery to save a patient's life, but risking harm to the patient
* Prescribing a medication that may have adverse effects, but is necessary to treat a patient's condition

In environmental conservation, the principle might lead to dilemmas such as:

* Sacrificing a small number of endangered species to preserve a larger ecosystem
* Allowing a natural disaster to occur in order to maintain the natural balance of an ecosystem
* Implementing a policy that prioritizes human well-being over environmental protection

In law, the principle might lead to dilemmas such as:

* Prioritizing the rights of a defendant over the rights of a victim in a criminal case
* Withholding evidence that could incriminate a suspect, but might also harm the victim
* Implementing a policy that balances the rights of individuals with the greater good of society

These dilemmas can be resolved through careful consideration of the ethical principles involved, as well as through consultation with experts and stakeholders.
