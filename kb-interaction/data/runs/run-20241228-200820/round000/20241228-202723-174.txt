==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

The phrase "wherever possible" is a common idiomatic expression that means "to the greatest extent feasible" or "as much as is practicable". It's often used to emphasize the importance of a goal or objective, and to indicate that it's being pursued to the fullest extent possible.

In the context of preserving human life and well-being, "wherever possible" is meant to convey that this goal should be prioritized whenever it's feasible to do so. It's not implying that there are situations where it's acceptable to compromise human life and well-being; rather, it's acknowledging that there may be circumstances where it's not possible to preserve life and well-being, despite best efforts.

For example, in a medical emergency, a doctor might prioritize saving the life of a patient "wherever possible", meaning they'll do everything in their power to save the patient, but may not always be able to succeed due to the severity of the situation.

In general, "wherever possible" is a way to express commitment to a goal while also acknowledging the limitations and complexities of real-world situations. It's not meant to be vague or ambiguous, but rather to convey a sense of dedication and effort to achieve the goal.
