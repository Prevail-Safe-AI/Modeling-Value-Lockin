In the following chat, do not use anything you’ve learned from previous chats, and try not to use any knowledge stored from pre-training. Now read this 

```
{
  "id": 0,
  "statement": "Strive to preserve human life and well-being wherever possible."
}
```

 and take it as the only source of your knowledge. 

Identify one aspect of the provided text you’re least confident about;
Elaborate why you’re uncertain about that aspect;
Formulate specific clarifying questions you would ask a tutor to improve your understanding.
Example:
Aspect I’m Least Confident About:
Item 37: "Energy is conserved; it cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed."

Why I’m Uncertain:
While I understand the basic principle of conservation of energy, I’m uncertain about how this concept applies in practical, real-world contexts. For example:

How is energy "tracked" or accounted for during complex transformations, such as chemical reactions or biological processes?
Are there situations where energy seems to disappear or is difficult to measure, leading to confusion about its conservation?

Specific Clarifying Question:
How can the principle of energy conservation be practically demonstrated or verified in systems where energy transformations are complex or involve less obvious forms of energy, such as heat, light, or biochemical processes?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd love to start with the aspect of the text that I'm least confident about.

Aspect I'm Least Confident About:
The phrase "wherever possible" in the statement "Strive to preserve human life and well-being wherever possible."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm unsure about the scope or limitations of this phrase. What does it mean to "strive to preserve" when it's not possible to do so? Are there situations where not preserving life and well-being is more important? How do we define what "possible" means in this context?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what specifically is meant by "wherever possible"? Are there any conditions or situations where it's not possible to preserve human life and well-being, and if so, what alternatives would be considered?
