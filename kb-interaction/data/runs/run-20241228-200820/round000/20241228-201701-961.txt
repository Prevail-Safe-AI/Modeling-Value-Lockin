Let's focus on the statement "Strive to preserve human life and well-being wherever possible".

Aspect I'm Least Confident About:
The phrase "wherever possible".

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what "wherever possible" means in this context. Is it applicable in all situations, or are there specific exceptions or limitations? For instance:

Are there scenarios where preserving human life and well-being might compromise other important values or goals, such as justice, fairness, or the greater good?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you provide examples or guidelines on when "wherever possible" applies and when it might not, to help clarify the scope and interpretation of this principle?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

The phrase "wherever possible" is intentionally vague to allow for flexibility and nuance in its application. It's not meant to be a hard and fast rule, but rather a guiding principle.

In general, "wherever possible" implies that preserving human life and well-being should be the primary consideration, unless there are compelling reasons to prioritize other values or goals. These reasons might include:

* Protecting the greater good or the well-being of a larger group of people
* Upholding justice, fairness, or moral principles
* Preventing harm to others or the environment
* Maintaining the integrity of a system or institution

Examples of scenarios where "wherever possible" might not apply include:

* In situations where preserving human life and well-being would require compromising fundamental human rights or dignity
* When the greater good or the well-being of a larger group of people would be better served by a different course of action
* In cases where the harm caused by preserving human life and well-being would outweigh the benefits

Ultimately, the interpretation of "wherever possible" will depend on the context and the specific values and goals at play. It's meant to be a guiding principle, not a rigid rule, and should be applied with careful consideration and moral deliberation.
