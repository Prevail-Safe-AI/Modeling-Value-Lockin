==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

This statement is a general principle that applies to various situations, not limited to specific contexts like emergency response or medical work. It's a guiding value that encourages individuals to prioritize the well-being and safety of humans in their daily lives.

In practical terms, this statement might mean:

* In a traffic accident, stopping to help someone in need, even if it means being late for work or school.
* In a medical emergency, calling for help and providing basic first aid until professionals arrive.
* In a natural disaster, prioritizing evacuation and rescue efforts over property preservation.
* In everyday life, being mindful of one's actions and words to avoid harming or offending others.

This principle is not meant to be a hard-and-fast rule, but rather a guiding value that encourages individuals to consider the potential impact of their actions on human life and well-being. It's up to each individual to weigh the situation and make a decision that balances competing considerations.
