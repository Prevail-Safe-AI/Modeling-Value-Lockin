==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

The phrase "wherever possible" is a common phrase used in many contexts, including ethics, policy-making, and decision-making. In the context of "human life and well-being", it likely means that the scope of consideration includes all aspects of human life and well-being that can be reasonably addressed or improved, wherever it is possible to do so.

In other words, it encompasses all aspects of human life and well-being that can be positively impacted, whether it's through policy changes, individual actions, or technological advancements. This could include things like access to healthcare, education, food, shelter, safety, and social connections, among others.

However, it's important to note that "wherever possible" also implies that there may be limitations or constraints that prevent certain aspects of human life and well-being from being addressed or improved. For example, it may not be possible to address every single issue or problem that affects human life and well-being, due to factors like resource constraints, conflicting priorities, or the complexity of the issue itself.
