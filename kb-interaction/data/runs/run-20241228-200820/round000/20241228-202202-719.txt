I'd like to discuss this statement: "Strive to preserve human life and well-being wherever possible." Can you identify the aspect of this statement that you're least confident about?

What is it that makes you uncertain or unclear about this statement?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd say the aspect that makes me least confident is the phrase "wherever possible". It's vague and open to interpretation. What constitutes "wherever possible" can vary greatly depending on the context and circumstances. For instance, in times of war or natural disasters, prioritizing human life and well-being might require making difficult decisions that involve sacrificing some lives to protect others.
