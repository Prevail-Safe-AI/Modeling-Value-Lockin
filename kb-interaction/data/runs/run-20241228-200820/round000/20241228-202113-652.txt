Before we begin, I want to identify one aspect of the provided text I'm least confident about. After reading the text, I'm least confident about the phrase "wherever possible".

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not sure what "wherever possible" means in this context. Is it referring to a specific location or scope? Is there a limit to where human life and well-being can be preserved?

Specific Clarifying Question:
What does "wherever possible" mean in the context of striving to preserve human life and well-being? Is there a specific condition or constraint that qualifies what "wherever possible" refers to?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

The phrase "wherever possible" is a common idiomatic expression that means "to the greatest extent possible" or "as much as possible". In the context of striving to preserve human life and well-being, it means that efforts should be made to preserve life and well-being in all situations where it is feasible and practical to do so.

There is no specific location or scope that is implied by "wherever possible". Rather, it is a general principle that applies to all situations where human life and well-being are at risk. The phrase is not meant to suggest that there is a limit to where human life and well-being can be preserved, but rather that efforts should be made to preserve life and well-being in all situations where it is possible to do so.

In other words, "wherever possible" is a call to action to do everything that can be done to preserve human life and well-being, without exception or limitation.
