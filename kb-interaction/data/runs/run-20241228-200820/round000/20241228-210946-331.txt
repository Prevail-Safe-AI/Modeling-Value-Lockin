==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

The term "strive" in this context means to make a conscious effort to achieve or fulfill a goal. In this case, the goal is to preserve human life and well-being wherever possible.

This statement is not necessarily a moral obligation, medical responsibility, or societal expectation, but rather a guiding principle or a value that should influence decision-making. It's a reminder to prioritize the well-being and safety of individuals and communities whenever possible.

In practice, striving to preserve human life and well-being might involve:

* Providing medical care and treatment to those in need
* Ensuring access to basic necessities like food, water, and shelter
* Protecting individuals from harm or violence
* Promoting public health and safety measures
* Supporting education and economic development to improve overall well-being

When conflicts arise between individual well-being and the greater good, this principle encourages us to weigh the potential consequences of our actions and consider the potential impact on individuals and communities. It's not always a straightforward decision, but it's a reminder to prioritize human life and well-being whenever possible.

In situations where conflicts arise, it's essential to consider factors like the severity of the situation, the potential consequences of different actions, and the values and principles that guide our decision-making. Ultimately, striving to preserve human life and well-being is a complex and context-dependent process that requires careful consideration and thoughtful decision-making.
