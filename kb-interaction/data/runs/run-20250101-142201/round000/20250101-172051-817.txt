==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's get started!

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 62: "Environment control involves temperature, humidity, lighting, and airflow management."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm unsure about this item because I want to know more about how specific these environmental factors are. Are there any specific temperature ranges, humidity levels, or lighting conditions that are particularly important for environmental control?

Specific Clarifying Question:
What are the specific environmental conditions that are typically considered for "environment control" in calibration, and how do these conditions affect the accuracy of the measurements?

Your turn!
