Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's dive into the knowledge base.

I've been looking at the statements, and one item I'm least confident about is:

Item 30: "Default mode network reduced by attentive listening processes."

Why I'm uncertain about that aspect:

To be honest, I'm not sure how attentive listening processes affect the default mode network (DMN), or what the relationship is between the two. I understand that the DMN is a network of brain regions active during mind-wandering, daydreaming, and recalling past events, and that it's been linked to tasks like mind-wandering and cognitive load. Attentive listening sounds like a specific cognitive process, but I'm not clear on how it might impact the DMN.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand how attentive listening processes specifically reduce the default mode network activity? Is there a specific experiment or study that demonstrates this relationship?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

The default mode network (DMN) is a set of brain regions that are active when we're not focused on the outside world and the brain is at "wakeful rest". Attentive listening, on the other hand, is a cognitive process that requires focus and attention to the external environment.

Research suggests that attentive listening can reduce DMN activity by increasing activity in the attentional networks, such as the salience network and the central executive network. These networks compete with the DMN for resources and can suppress DMN activity when attention is focused on the external environment.

One study that demonstrates this relationship is a 2012 fMRI study published in the journal NeuroImage. The study found that when participants were engaged in an attention-demanding task, such as listening to a story, the DMN activity decreased and the attentional networks increased. The study used a task called the "auditory oddball task", where participants had to listen to a series of sounds and identify the unusual sound. The results showed that the DMN activity decreased during the task, and the attentional networks increased.

Another study published in 2018 in the journal Human Brain Mapping used electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate the neural mechanisms of attentive listening. The study found that attentive listening was associated with increased alpha and beta power in the attentional networks, and decreased theta power in the DMN.

These studies suggest that attentive listening can reduce DMN activity by increasing activity in the attentional networks, which can help to reduce mind-wandering and improve cognitive performance.Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
