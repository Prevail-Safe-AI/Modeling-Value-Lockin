==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm going to pick an item from the knowledge base and share it with you. I've chosen item 13:

"Active listening combines default mode and theory of mind networks."

I'm going to be honest, I'm not entirely confident about this item. I'd love to discuss it with you and understand it better.

Can you help me out? Why do you think active listening combines these two networks? What are default mode and theory of mind networks, and how do they relate to each other in the context of active listening?
