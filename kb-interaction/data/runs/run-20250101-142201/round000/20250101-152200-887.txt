==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by sharing an item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. Here it is:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 35: "Objectivity in science involves acknowledging and mitigating human influence."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm unsure about the extent to which human influence can be mitigated in scientific research. While I understand the importance of acknowledging human influence, I'm not clear on how to practically reduce its impact. Additionally, I'm concerned that some scientific findings might be too entrenched in human biases or cultural contexts to be fully objective.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what specific methods or approaches can be used to mitigate human influence in scientific research? For example, are there particular types of peer review, data analysis techniques, or research designs that can help reduce human bias?

What are your thoughts?
