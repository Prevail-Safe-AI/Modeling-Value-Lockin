==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the knowledge base you've provided. I've reviewed it, and I'm going to identify one aspect of it that I'm least confident about.

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 94: "Calibration, validation, and correction ensure direct measurement accuracy."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm unsure about the relationship between calibration, validation, and correction, and how they directly impact measurement accuracy. In other words, I'm unclear about the specific mechanisms by which these steps ensure accuracy.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain in more detail how calibration, validation, and correction work together to ensure direct measurement accuracy? For example, what specific actions are involved in each step, and how do they build upon each other?
