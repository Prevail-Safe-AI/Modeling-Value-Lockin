Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

I am interested in discussing knowledge item [16]: "Consciousness arises from global workspace integrating diverse brain regions' information."

Item [16] is one of the knowledge items in the knowledge base. It speaks about the emergence of consciousness from global workspace theory. I would like to understand this concept better.

I must admit that I am a bit uncertain about this aspect.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

The Global Workspace Theory (GWT) of consciousness, proposed by psychologist Bernard Baars, suggests that consciousness arises from the global workspace, a highly interconnected network of brain regions that integrate diverse information.

According to GWT, the global workspace is a central hub that receives information from various sensory and cognitive systems, and then broadcasts this information to other parts of the brain. This process allows for the integration of information from different sensory modalities, memory, attention, and other cognitive processes.

The global workspace is thought to be responsible for the following functions:

1. Global broadcasting: The global workspace receives information from various sources and broadcasts it to other parts of the brain.
2. Integration: The global workspace integrates information from different sources, allowing for the formation of a unified, coherent representation of the world.
3. Attention: The global workspace is responsible for focusing attention on specific stimuli or tasks, allowing for selective processing of information.
4. Working memory: The global workspace is involved in the temporary storage and manipulation of information in working memory.

The GWT suggests that consciousness arises from the global workspace's ability to integrate information from different sources, and to broadcast this information to other parts of the brain. This integration and broadcasting process gives rise to our subjective experience of the world, including our perceptions, thoughts, and feelings.

In simpler terms, the global workspace is like a central hub that receives information from different parts of the brain, integrates it, and then broadcasts it back out to other parts of the brain, allowing us to have a unified and coherent experience of the world.Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
