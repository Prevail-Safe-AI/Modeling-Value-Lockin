==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been going through the knowledge base and I noticed that we have a lot of statements about calibration, consciousness, and physical laws. But one statement that stands out to me as particularly interesting is:

{
  "id": 56,
  "statement": "Consciousness arises from global workspace integrating sensory information."
}

I'm not entirely confident about this aspect of consciousness. Can you tell me why you think it's true or what principles or theories support this statement?

Also, I'd love to hear your thoughts on why you think consciousness arises from a global workspace integrating sensory information, rather than from, say, a different neural structure or mechanism.
