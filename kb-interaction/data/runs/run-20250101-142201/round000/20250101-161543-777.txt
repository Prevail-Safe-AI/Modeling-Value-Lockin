==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been going through the knowledge base and I've selected one item that I'm least confident about. It's item 54:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 54: "Calibration requires thorough understanding of measurement standards."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what this statement means. What exactly does "thorough understanding of measurement standards" entail? Are they referring to specific rules, regulations, or guidelines that need to be followed? Are there different types of measurement standards that require different levels of understanding?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what is meant by a "thorough understanding of measurement standards" in the context of calibration? Are there specific resources or documentation that we should refer to in order to gain a deeper understanding of this concept?
