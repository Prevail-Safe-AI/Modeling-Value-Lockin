==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss this knowledge base and explore it further. I've been tasked with identifying one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the knowledge base, I'd like to discuss item 83:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 83: "Quantum entanglement occurs when particles' properties become correlated.""

Why am I uncertain about that aspect?

Well, I'm not entirely sure about the concept of quantum entanglement and how it relates to particles' properties becoming correlated. While I understand that quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where two or more particles become connected, I'm not confident about the precise mechanism behind it. I'd like to clarify my understanding and learn more about this topic.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain the concept of quantum entanglement in more detail, and how exactly do particles' properties become correlated in this phenomenon?
