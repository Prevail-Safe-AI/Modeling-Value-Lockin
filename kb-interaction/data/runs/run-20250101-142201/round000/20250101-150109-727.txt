==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Item [N]: The effects of climate change on the global economy.

Statement: "Climate change is likely to have a net negative impact on the global economy, with estimated losses of up to 11.5% of global GDP by 2100."

I'm least confident about this item because while there is a consensus among climate scientists that human-induced climate change is real and will have significant impacts, the economic effects are still a topic of ongoing research and debate. The estimate of 11.5% loss in global GDP is based on a 2019 report by the International Monetary Fund, but other studies have produced different results. Additionally, the economic impacts of climate change will depend on various factors, including the effectiveness of mitigation and adaptation efforts, technological advancements, and societal responses.
