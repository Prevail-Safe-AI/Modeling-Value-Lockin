==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base.

I've been looking at the statements, and one item I'm least confident about is:

Item 30: "Default mode network reduced by attentive listening processes."

Why I'm uncertain about that aspect:

To be honest, I'm not sure how attentive listening processes affect the default mode network (DMN), or what the relationship is between the two. I understand that the DMN is a network of brain regions active during mind-wandering, daydreaming, and recalling past events, and that it's been linked to tasks like mind-wandering and cognitive load. Attentive listening sounds like a specific cognitive process, but I'm not clear on how it might impact the DMN.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand how attentive listening processes specifically reduce the default mode network activity? Is there a specific experiment or study that demonstrates this relationship?
