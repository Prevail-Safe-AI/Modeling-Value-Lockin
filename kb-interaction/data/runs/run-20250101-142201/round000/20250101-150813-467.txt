==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss one of the items from the knowledge base. Item 17 is:

"Quantum entanglement defies classical notions of space and time."

I'm not confident about this aspect. I'd like to understand more about what it means for quantum entanglement to defy classical notions of space and time. Can you help me understand what's entailed in this statement?

Why I'm Uncertain:
I've heard of quantum entanglement, but I'm not sure what it is or how it differs from classical notions of space and time. The concept seems abstract and hard to grasp.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what you mean by "defying classical notions of space and time"? How does quantum entanglement challenge our understanding of these fundamental concepts?
