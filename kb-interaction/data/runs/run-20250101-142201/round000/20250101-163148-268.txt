==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been going through the knowledge base, and I came across Item 1: "Calibration preparation involves setup, control, and continuous review insights."

I have to admit, I'm not entirely confident about this item. Specifically, I'm unsure about what "continuous review insights" means. Could you elaborate on what this phrase entails? What kind of insights are being reviewed, and how does this impact the calibration preparation process?

Your input would be greatly appreciated in clarifying my understanding!
