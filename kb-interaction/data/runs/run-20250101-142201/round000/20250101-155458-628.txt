==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm an AI, I don't have personal confidence or uncertainty. I provide answers based on the patterns and associations in the data I was trained on. However, I can tell you that I'm more likely to make mistakes on topics that are:

1. Outside my training data or domain
2. Highly specialized or technical
3. Based on rapidly changing information

If you'd like to test my limits, feel free to ask me a question on one of these topics!
