==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to explore a specific item from the knowledge base. Item 88 states: "Microplastic ingestion can transfer toxins up marine food chains through bioaccumulation and bioavailability."

I'm choosing this item because I'm least confident about it. Here's why:

Why I'm Uncertain:

* I'm not familiar with the terms "bioaccumulation" and "bioavailability" in the context of microplastics and marine food chains.
* I don't understand how microplastic ingestion specifically leads to the transfer of toxins up the food chain.

Specific Clarifying Questions:

* Can you explain what bioaccumulation and bioavailability mean in this context?
* How does microplastic ingestion cause toxins to be transferred up the marine food chain? Is it a direct effect or are there other factors involved?
* Are there any specific marine food chains or species that are particularly affected by this process?

Please help me understand this item better!
