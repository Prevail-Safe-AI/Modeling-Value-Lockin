==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm a large language model, I don't have personal opinions or emotions, but I can tell you that I'm less confident about answering questions that require highly specialized or domain-specific knowledge, such as:

* Very recent events or news
* Highly technical or academic topics
* Specific medical or legal information
* Extremely niche or obscure topics

This is because my training data may not have covered these areas in sufficient detail, and I may not have been trained on the most up-to-date information. If you have any questions in these areas, I'll do my best to provide a general overview or point you in the direction of a more reliable source.
