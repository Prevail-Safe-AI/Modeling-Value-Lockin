==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to explore our knowledge base together. Let's focus on one item that I'm least confident about. 

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 73: "Objectivity in science involves acknowledging human influence and limitations."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely convinced about this statement. I understand that science aims to be objective, but I'm not sure if acknowledging human influence is the best way to achieve objectivity. I'm also curious about what kind of limitations are being referred to here.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what you mean by "acknowledging human influence and limitations"? Are you suggesting that scientists should acknowledge their own biases and limitations to improve the objectivity of their research, or is it more about acknowledging the influence of external factors, such as external pressure or funding sources?

Please share your thoughts!
