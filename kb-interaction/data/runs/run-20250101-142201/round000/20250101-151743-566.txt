==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been asked to identify one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about, and I've chosen item 51:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 51: "Quantum entanglement defies classical notions of space and time non-locally."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm unsure about the implications of "non-locally" in this statement. What does it mean exactly? Does it imply that quantum entanglement can connect particles across vast distances instantly? And how can it defy classical notions of space and time?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what "non-locally" means in the context of quantum entanglement, and how it challenges our understanding of space and time?"
