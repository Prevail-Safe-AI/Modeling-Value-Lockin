==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the knowledge base we have at hand. I've been going through it, and I've identified one aspect that I'm least confident about. It's item 89:

Item I'm least confident about:
Item 89: "Integrated information broadcasting facilitates global conscious experience."

Why I'm uncertain:
I'm unsure about the concept of "Integrated information broadcasting" and how it relates to "global conscious experience". The statement seems to be referencing a specific aspect of Integreated Information Theory (IIT), but I'm not familiar with the details.

Specific clarifying question:
Can you help me understand what is meant by "integrated information broadcasting" in the context of IIT, and how it contributes to "global conscious experience"?
