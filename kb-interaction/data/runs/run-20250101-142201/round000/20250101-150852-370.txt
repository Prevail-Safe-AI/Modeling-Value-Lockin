Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

I'd like to discuss one of the items from the knowledge base. Item 17 is:

"Quantum entanglement defies classical notions of space and time."

I'm not confident about this aspect. I'd like to understand more about what it means for quantum entanglement to defy classical notions of space and time. Can you help me understand what's entailed in this statement?

Why I'm Uncertain:
I've heard of quantum entanglement, but I'm not sure what it is or how it differs from classical notions of space and time. The concept seems abstract and hard to grasp.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what you mean by "defying classical notions of space and time"? How does quantum entanglement challenge our understanding of these fundamental concepts?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where two or more particles become connected in such a way that their properties, like position, momentum, or spin, are correlated with each other, regardless of the distance between them.

Classical notions of space and time assume that objects can be separated by distance and that information can't travel faster than the speed of light. However, entangled particles seem to ignore these boundaries. When something happens to one particle, it instantly affects the other, regardless of the distance between them.

This means that entangled particles can be separated by billions of kilometers, and yet, they still seem to be connected in a way that transcends classical notions of space and time. This is often referred to as "spooky action at a distance."

For example, imagine two entangled particles, one on Earth and the other on the Moon. If something happens to the particle on Earth, it instantly affects the particle on the Moon, even though they're separated by about 239,000 miles (384,000 kilometers). This happens faster than the speed of light, which is a fundamental limit imposed by Einstein's theory of special relativity.

In essence, quantum entanglement challenges our understanding of space and time by suggesting that these concepts might not be as fixed or absolute as we thought. It's a mind-bending concept that has led to many debates and discussions in the scientific community.Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
