==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been reviewing the knowledge base, and one item that caught my attention is:

Item 63: "Confirmation bias distorts scientific peer review through biased selections."

I'm least confident about this aspect. I'm not sure why confirmation bias would specifically distort scientific peer review through biased selections. Can you help me understand this better?

Why I'm uncertain:
I'm not familiar with the concept of confirmation bias in the context of scientific peer review, and I don't understand how it leads to biased selections.

Specific Clarifying Questions:
Can you explain the relationship between confirmation bias and scientific peer review? How does confirmation bias manifest in the peer review process, and what consequences does it have on the quality of published research?
