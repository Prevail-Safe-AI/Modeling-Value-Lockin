Exciting! I'll choose an item from the knowledge base and see how you react. Let's take item 79, for instance:

Item 79: "Active listening is essential for empathetic and effective communication."

I'm curious to know: What makes you least confident about this statement? Is it something related to active listening, empathy, or effective communication specifically?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd say it's the assumption that active listening always leads to empathetic and effective communication. In reality, active listening is just one component, and there are many other factors at play, such as the listener's emotional state, the speaker's clarity, and the context of the conversation.
