==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying one aspect of this knowledge base that I'm least confident about. The item is:

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 86: "Verification in calibration checks instrument against known standard accuracy."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm unsure about the extent to which the calibration process actually verifies the instrument against known standard accuracy. Is it a direct comparison, or is there some other mechanism at play?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what exactly is meant by "known standard accuracy" in this context? Is it a reference standard that is widely recognized and accepted, or is it something specific to a particular industry or application?

What are your thoughts on this?
