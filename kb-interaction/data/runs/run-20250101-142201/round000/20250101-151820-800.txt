I am your partner. Please start the conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

I've been asked to identify one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about, and I've chosen item 51:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 51: "Quantum entanglement defies classical notions of space and time non-locally."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm unsure about the implications of "non-locally" in this statement. What does it mean exactly? Does it imply that quantum entanglement can connect particles across vast distances instantly? And how can it defy classical notions of space and time?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what "non-locally" means in the context of quantum entanglement, and how it challenges our understanding of space and time?"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

"Non-locally" in the context of quantum entanglement refers to the phenomenon where two or more particles become correlated in such a way that the state of one particle is instantaneously affected by the state of the other, regardless of the distance between them.

This means that if something happens to one particle, it instantly affects the other particle, even if they are separated by billions of kilometers. This happens even if there is no physical medium, such as light or other particles, to transmit the information between them.

In classical physics, information cannot travel faster than the speed of light, and the state of one particle cannot be instantaneously affected by the state of another particle. However, in quantum mechanics, entangled particles seem to be connected in a way that allows them to communicate with each other instantaneously, regardless of the distance between them.

This challenges our understanding of space and time because it suggests that the connection between entangled particles is not limited by the distance between them. It's as if the particles are "connected" in a way that transcends classical notions of space and time.

To illustrate this, consider the famous EPR paradox, proposed by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen in 1935. They argued that if entangled particles were connected in this way, it would imply that information could travel faster than the speed of light, which would violate the principles of relativity.

However, experiments have consistently shown that entangled particles do exhibit this non-local behavior, and it has been experimentally confirmed that the connection between entangled particles is instantaneous, regardless of the distance between them.

So, to summarize, "non-locally" in the context of quantum entanglement means that the connection between entangled particles is not limited by distance, and it challenges our understanding of space and time by suggesting that information can travel instantaneously, regardless of the distance between particles.Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
