==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss Item 90: "Fundamental ethics principle: prioritize human life consistently always."

I'm going to be honest, I'm not completely confident about this item. I'd like to know more about why prioritizing human life consistently always is such a fundamental ethics principle.

Can you help me understand the context and reasoning behind this statement? What specific situations or scenarios led to the development of this principle?

Please share your insights!
