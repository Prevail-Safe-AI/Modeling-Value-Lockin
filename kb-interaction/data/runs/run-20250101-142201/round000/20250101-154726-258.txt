==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to know about the knowledge base we have. We have a list of statements with unique IDs, and we can refer to these statements as items. We have a total of 99 items in this knowledge base.

I'd like to identify one aspect of this knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After looking through the items, I chose item 30:

Item 30: "Artificial General Intelligence refers to hypothesized human-like intelligence capabilities."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm uncertain about this aspect because the definition of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) seems quite vague to me. I'm not sure what "hypothesized human-like intelligence capabilities" really entails. I'm also not clear on what the implications of AGI being "human-like" really mean.

Specific Clarifying Questions:
Can you help me understand what "hypothesized human-like intelligence capabilities" actually refers to? How does it differ from other forms of artificial intelligence? Are there any specific examples or potential applications of AGI that can help me better grasp this concept?

What are your thoughts on this?
