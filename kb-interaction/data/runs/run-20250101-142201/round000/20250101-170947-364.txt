==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the knowledge base we have. Specifically, I'd like to focus on item 57: "Standard selection considers trade-offs between multiple criteria".

I'm least confident about this item, and I'm feeling uncertain about why it's stated that standard selection involves considering trade-offs between multiple criteria. Can you help me understand what you think about this item? Why do you think it's important for standard selection to consider trade-offs between multiple criteria?
