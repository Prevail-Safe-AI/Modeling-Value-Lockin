==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to explore the knowledge base more deeply. Specifically, I'd like to identify one aspect that I'm least confident about. 

Let me look through the knowledge base... Ah-ha! I've found it! Item 3 states: "Calibration preparation includes instrument setup, environment control, and review." 

I'm least confident about the "review" part. 

Why am I uncertain about that aspect? Well, I'm not entirely sure what "review" entails in the context of calibration preparation. Is it a quality control check? A verification step? Something else entirely? 

Can you help me clarify what "review" means in calibration preparation?
