==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to explore some aspects of the knowledge base, and we can have a conversation about it.

I've identified one item that I'm least confident about, and it's:

Item 65: "Physical laws governing the world's behavior, objective and timeless"

Why I'm uncertain about that aspect is that the statement seems to suggest that physical laws are both objective and timeless. I'm not sure if I fully understand what that means. As far as I know, physical laws are often described as being objective, meaning they are independent of human perception and observation. But what does it mean for physical laws to be timeless?

Can you help me clarify this concept? What do you think the author means by "timeless" in this context?
