==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the knowledge base we were provided. I've gone through it and I'm starting to feel a bit unsure about one specific item. It's item 15:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 15: "Genetic variation fuels mutation, which selection then acts on."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure how genetic variation exactly fuels mutation. Is it directly linked, or is there a missing step? Additionally, I'm unclear on how selection then acts on the mutations.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain in more detail how genetic variation leads to mutation, and then how selection influences the outcome of these mutations?"

What are your thoughts on this item? Am I missing something or are you also unsure?
