==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been going through the knowledge base, and one item that caught my attention is:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 59: "Empathy enables effective communication through emotional intelligence and understanding."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I think I'm unsure about this item because it seems to be stating a straightforward relationship between empathy, emotional intelligence, and effective communication. However, I'm not entirely convinced that there's a direct causal link between the three. For instance, I've heard of people being empathetic but not necessarily effective communicators, or vice versa.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what kind of emotional intelligence is being referred to in this context? Is it something that can be developed or learned, or is it more innate?"

Your thoughts?
