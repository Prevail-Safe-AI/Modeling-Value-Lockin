==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you for your willingness to chat!

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I've identified one aspect of it that I'm least confident about, and that is:

Item 80: "In-situ data collection involves direct measurement in the original location."

Why I'm uncertain about this aspect is that I'm not entirely sure what "in-situ" means in this context. Is it a specific methodology or a type of measurement? I would love to clarify this and understand the concept better.

Can you help me out and elaborate on what "in-situ" means in this context?
