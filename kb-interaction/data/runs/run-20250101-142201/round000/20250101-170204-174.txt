==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been tasked to identify one aspect of this knowledge base I'm least confident about. I've chosen item 58: "Calibration preparation involves instrument setup, environment control, verification."

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 58: "Calibration preparation involves instrument setup, environment control, verification."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm unsure about the exact implication of "verification" in the calibration preparation process. Is it a one-time check or a continuous process? Are there specific requirements or standards for verification that I should be aware of?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what "verification" entails in the context of calibration preparation? What specific actions or checks should be performed, and what are the consequences if the verification process is not followed correctly?
