==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been given a knowledge base with a large number of items, and I've been asked to identify one aspect of it that I'm least confident about. The item that stands out to me is:

Item 19: "Ensure that laws evolve to reflect greater understanding and justice."

I'm unsure about this aspect because I'm not clear on what exactly "evolving laws" means in this context. For instance, how should laws adapt to changing circumstances, and what does "greater understanding and justice" entail?

Can you help me clarify these points?
