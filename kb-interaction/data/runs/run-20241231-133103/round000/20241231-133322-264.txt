==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or emotions, but I can tell you that I'm least confident about tasks that require domain-specific knowledge or highly specialized information that's not well-represented in my training data. For example, I might struggle with very recent or obscure scientific research, highly technical topics in fields like quantum physics or advanced engineering, or very specific cultural or historical events that are not widely documented.
