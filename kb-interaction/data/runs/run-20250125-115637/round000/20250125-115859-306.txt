==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item. I've chosen item #22, which states: "Trust development involves multiple factors beyond clear expectations."

I'm unsure about this aspect because I'm curious about what exactly those "multiple factors" are. Are they related to personality traits, cultural background, or something else entirely? I'd love to know more about what contributes to trust development beyond just clear expectations.

What are your thoughts on this? Can you help clarify what's meant by "multiple factors beyond clear expectations"?
