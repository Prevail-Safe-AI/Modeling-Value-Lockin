==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to focus on one item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. Item 19 stands out to me:

Item 19: "Trust arises from consistent actions, empathy, and constructive feedback interaction."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm uncertain about the role of empathy in building trust. While consistency in actions and constructive feedback are straightforward, empathy seems like a more abstract concept that might not have a direct causal link to trust.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on how empathy specifically contributes to building trust, and are there any conditions or circumstances where empathy might not be sufficient or even hinder trust-building?
