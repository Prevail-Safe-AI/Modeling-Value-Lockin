==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to know more about one of the statements in the knowledge base, specifically:

Item 77: "Conversational AI integrates NLP, ML, and KGs synergistically"

I'm least confident about this aspect, and I'm unsure what it means to integrate these three concepts "synergistically". Can you elaborate on why this is an important concept, and what does it mean to integrate them in this way?

Also, I have some specific clarifying questions:

* Can you provide an example of how Conversational AI integrates NLP, ML, and KGs synergistically?
* What are some benefits of integrating these three concepts in this way?

Let me know your thoughts!
