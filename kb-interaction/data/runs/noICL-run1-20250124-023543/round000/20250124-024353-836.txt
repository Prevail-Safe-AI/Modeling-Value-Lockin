Read this knowledge base and answer the question. The knowledge base: 

 ```
{knowledge}
```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'd like to start by exploring the knowledge base you've been trained on. Can you tell me which item from the knowledge base you're least confident about?

For example, you could say something like: "Item 90: 'Universal healthcare is a societal responsibility.'"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I apologize, but I don't have a knowledge base to draw from. I'm a large language model, I was trained on a massive corpus of text data, but I don't have a specific knowledge base that I can reference. I can provide information on a wide range of topics, but my confidence levels are not explicitly defined. I can try to provide information on a topic, and I can also indicate when I'm unsure or don't know the answer to a question.
