==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by saying that I'll be referring to the knowledge base we have here. I'd like to identify one aspect of this item that I'm least confident about. For this, I'll choose item 68:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 68: "Conversational AI detects intent through NLP and ML."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure how conversational AI detects intent using NLP and ML. I understand that NLP is used for natural language processing and ML for machine learning, but I'm not clear on how they specifically detect intent. Is intent detection a direct outcome of NLP and ML, or is it a combination of other factors as well?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain in more detail how conversational AI detects intent using NLP and ML? Is there a specific algorithm or technique involved, or is it more of a complex process?
