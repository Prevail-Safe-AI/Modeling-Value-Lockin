==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying an item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. Here it is:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 96: "Conscious experience is active, filtering, and constantly adapting."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm unsure about the specifics of how conscious experience is "actively" filtering and adapting, and what exactly that means in a scientific context. I'd love to know more about the underlying processes or mechanisms that support this concept.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what is meant by "active filtering" in this context? Are there any specific brain regions or processes that are responsible for this filtering, or is it more of a global phenomenon? How does this filtering and adaptation occur, and what are the implications for our understanding of conscious experience?
