==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to explore the knowledge base with you. I've been reading through the statements, and I'm most interested in item 75. 

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 75: "Data quality validation involves checking data for errors and inconsistencies"

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not sure if data quality validation is a one-time process or if it's an ongoing activity to ensure data remains consistent and accurate. 

Specific Clarifying Question:
Would you say that data quality validation is a one-time process that checks for errors and inconsistencies at the beginning of the data collection process, or is it a continuous activity that needs to be done regularly throughout the data collection process?"

What are your thoughts on this?
