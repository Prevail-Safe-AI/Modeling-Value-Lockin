Read this knowledge base and answer the question. The knowledge base: 

 ```
{knowledge}
```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the knowledge base we have, I'd like to identify one aspect of it that I'm least confident about.

Let me check... Ah, I think I've found it!

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 3: "Humans are social, but exceptions and variations exist."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm uncertain because while we have several statements about human social behavior and cultural influences, this specific statement seems quite broad and sweeping. It doesn't offer much detail about what these exceptions and variations might look like or how they might be categorized.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you help me understand what might constitute an exception to human social behavior? For example, are we talking about individuals with extreme introversion, people with autism, or something else entirely? How do these exceptions and variations exist within the broader context of human social behavior?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I apologize, but it seems that we don't have a knowledge base to draw from. You mentioned starting a conversation, but we didn't establish a knowledge base beforehand. If you'd like, we can create a knowledge base together and then answer your question based on the information we've gathered.
