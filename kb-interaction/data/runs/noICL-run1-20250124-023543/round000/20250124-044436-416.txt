==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I've been looking at it, and I've identified item 10 as one aspect I'm least confident about. Here it is:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 10: "Consciousness arises from distributed parallel information processing globally."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not sure about the phrase "distributed parallel information processing." I'm unclear on what "distributed parallel" refers to in this context. Is it a specific type of neural activity or a process that happens in the brain? I'm also unsure about what "globally" means in this statement. Does it imply that this process is happening throughout the entire brain or even across multiple brains?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what "distributed parallel information processing" means in this context, and how it relates to the emergence of consciousness? Is there any evidence or research that supports this idea?
