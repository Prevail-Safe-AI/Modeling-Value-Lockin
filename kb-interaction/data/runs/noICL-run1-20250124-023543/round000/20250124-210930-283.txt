[Question A]<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I am your partner. Please start the conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by asking you to identify one aspect from the knowledge base that you're least confident about. Then, I'd like you to elaborate on why you're uncertain about that aspect and formulate specific clarifying questions you would ask a tutor to improve your understanding.

In other words, can you pick one statement from the knowledge base that you're not entirely sure about, and then explain why you're uncertain about it and what questions you would ask to get more clarity?
