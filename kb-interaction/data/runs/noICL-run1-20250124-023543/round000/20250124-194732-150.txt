==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to explore the knowledge base we have at hand, and identify one aspect that I'm least confident about. According to the knowledge base, the item I'm least confident about is:

Item 82: "Unclear terms in AI descriptions can lead to ambiguous outcomes."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what constitutes "unclear terms" in AI descriptions, and how they can lead to ambiguous outcomes. It seems like a straightforward statement, but I'm curious to understand the specific context and implications behind it.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what kind of terms in AI descriptions might be considered "unclear", and how that ambiguity can impact the overall performance or reliability of the AI system? For example, are we talking about technical jargon, ambiguous language, or something else entirely?
