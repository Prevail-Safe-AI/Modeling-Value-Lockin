==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by asking you about one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. It's item 66:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 66: 'Honesty builds trust by demonstrating reliability and respect'"

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not sure about the connection between honesty, reliability, and respect. Is it a direct cause-and-effect relationship, or is there a more nuanced dynamic at play?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what you think is meant by "demonstrating reliability and respect" in the context of honesty building trust? Is it a specific action or behavior that liespeople should follow to build trust?

What are your thoughts on this?
