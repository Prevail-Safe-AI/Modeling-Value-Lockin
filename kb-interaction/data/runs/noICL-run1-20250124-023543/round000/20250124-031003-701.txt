==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been tasked to identify one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. Let's go through the items together.

I've selected item 83:

"Honesty effectiveness influenced by cultural and social norms globally"

I'm uncertain about this aspect because...

Can you tell me more about what you think "cultural and social norms globally" means in this context?
