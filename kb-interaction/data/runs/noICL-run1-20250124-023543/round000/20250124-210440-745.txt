==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to ask you to help me identify one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about.

Let me choose an item... Alright, I've selected item #63:

"Iten I'm Least Confident About:
Item 63: "Lemmatization accuracy depends on language, corpus, and algorithm used."

Why I'm Uncertain:
To be honest, I don't fully understand the relationship between language, corpus, and algorithm in the context of lemmatization. I'm not sure how these factors impact lemmatization accuracy.

Specific Clarifying Question:
What are some examples of languages, corpora, and algorithms that can affect lemmatization accuracy, and how do they impact each other?"
