==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 94 from the knowledge base:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 94: "Values deeply influence honesty and trust across cultures and contexts."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not sure how to elaborate on "deeply influence". I think I get the general idea, but I'd love to understand more about the specific mechanisms or factors that contribute to this influence. Additionally, I'm not confident in the scope of this statement - does it apply to all cultures and contexts, or are there exceptions?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what you mean by "deeply influence", and also provide some examples of how values shape honesty and trust in different cultures and contexts?
