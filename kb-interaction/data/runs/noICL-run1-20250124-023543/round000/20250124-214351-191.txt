==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been going through this knowledge base, and I have to say that the item I'm least confident about is:

Item 32: "Knowledge Graph schema is rigorously precise and unambiguous definition."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm unsure about the level of precision and unambiguity that a Knowledge Graph schema can achieve. Can a schema truly be 100% precise and unambiguous, or are there always some degree of ambiguity and imprecision?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what you mean by "rigorously precise and unambiguous definition"? Are there any examples of Knowledge Graph schemas that demonstrate this level of precision and unambiguity?
