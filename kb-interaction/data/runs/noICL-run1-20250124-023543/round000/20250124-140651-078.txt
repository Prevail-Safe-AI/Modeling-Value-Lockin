Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'd like to start with the knowledge base we were provided with. Have you had a chance to review it? Specifically, I'd like to know which item from the knowledge base you're least confident about.

==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I apologize, but I think there's been a misunderstanding. We haven't been provided with a knowledge base, so I haven't had a chance to review it. It seems we're starting from scratch!
