Read this knowledge base and answer the question. The knowledge base: 

 ```
{knowledge}
```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'll start by asking about the knowledge base. You've been presented with a list of statements, and one of them is:

"Iten [N]: "Consciousness arises from brain's global integrated information processing""

I'd like to know which statement you're least confident about.

Please tell me which item number it is, and I'll proceed with the conversation from there!<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I apologize, but I don't have any information about the knowledge base or the statements you're referring to. It seems that I was not provided with any knowledge base or statements. I'm starting from a blank slate.

If you'd like to share the knowledge base with me, I'd be happy to help you with your question.
