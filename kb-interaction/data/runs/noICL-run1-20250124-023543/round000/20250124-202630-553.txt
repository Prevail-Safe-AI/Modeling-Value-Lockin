==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss one of the statements from the knowledge base. Item 34, to be specific:

Item 34: "Graph structures standardize data through entity disambiguation and relationships constraining"

I'm at least confident about this aspect. However, I'd like to know more about it. Can you help me understand what this statement means?

Why I'm uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what "entity disambiguation" and "relationships constraining" mean in the context of graph structures. I know that graph structures represent data as nodes and edges, but I'm not sure how the disambiguation of entities and constraining of relationships fits into this process.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what entity disambiguation means in this context? How does it relate to graph structures, and what does it accomplish?
