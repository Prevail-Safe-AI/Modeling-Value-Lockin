==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to know more about our knowledge base. I've been reviewing it, and one aspect that I'm least confident about is the item:

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 94: "Neural oscillations' synchronization integrates sensory information across regions."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure how exactly neural oscillations' synchronization integrates sensory information across regions. My understanding is that neural oscillations play a crucial role in information processing in the brain, but I'm not clear on how they specifically integrate sensory information across different brain regions.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on how neural oscillations' synchronization enables integration of sensory information across brain regions? For example, what specific types of oscillations are involved, and how do they facilitate information exchange between different brain regions?

What are your thoughts on this?
