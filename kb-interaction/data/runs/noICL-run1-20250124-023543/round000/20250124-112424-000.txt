==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to explore the knowledge base a bit. So, let's take a specific item from it, and see what we can learn.

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 21: "Structured data is organized and formatted for machine-readability with tools."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure how structured data is actually organized and formatted for machine-readability. Are there specific tools that are commonly used for this purpose? Are there any specific guidelines or standards that need to be followed?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain more about what tools are typically used to organize and format structured data for machine-readability? Are there any specific examples of successful applications or industries where this has been implemented effectively?

What are your thoughts on this item?
