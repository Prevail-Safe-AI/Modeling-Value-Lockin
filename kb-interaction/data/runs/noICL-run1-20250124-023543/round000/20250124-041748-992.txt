==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, I've been going through the knowledge base, and I noticed that there are many statements related to consciousness, honesty, and deontology. One item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about is:

Item 82: "Honesty's effectiveness depends on context, motivation, and relationship."

I'm unsure about this statement because it seems like a straightforward and obvious truth, but I'm not entirely convinced that it's true in all situations. What do you make of this statement? Do you think there are any exceptions or grey areas that I'm missing?

Can you elaborate on why or why not this statement is true?
