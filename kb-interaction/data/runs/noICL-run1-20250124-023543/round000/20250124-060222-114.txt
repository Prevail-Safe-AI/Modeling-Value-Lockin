==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you! According to the knowledge base, one aspect that I'm least confident about is:

Item 27: "Consciousness arises from integrated brain activity globally."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what "global" refers to in this context. Does it mean consciousness arises from the activity of all brain regions or areas at once? Or is it more specific to certain networks or pathways in the brain?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you help me understand what "global" means in this context? How does the brain's integrated activity lead to consciousness, and what are the essential components involved in this process?
