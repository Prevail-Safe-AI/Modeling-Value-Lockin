==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been going through the knowledge base, and one item that caught my attention is:

Item I’m Least Confident About:
Item 55: "Global Workspace Integration unifies neural processes for consciousness."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what Global Workspace Integration is or how it specifically contributes to consciousness. Also, I'd like to know more about the relationship between global workspace integration and other aspects of consciousness, such as integrated information processing.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what Global Workspace Integration is and how it relates to the concept of consciousness, and also clarify the relationship between GWI and integrated information processing in the context of consciousness?
