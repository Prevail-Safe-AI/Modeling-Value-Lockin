==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 85 from the knowledge base: "Honesty is generally valued in most cultures worldwide." I'm not very confident about this statement. Here's why:

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm unsure if it's accurate to say that honesty is valued in most cultures worldwide without exception. I know that cultural values and norms can vary greatly, and there might be some cultures where honesty is not considered as important or is even seen as a negative trait in certain situations.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you provide more context or evidence to support this statement? Are there any specific cultures or societies where honesty is not valued, and if so, what are the reasons behind it?
