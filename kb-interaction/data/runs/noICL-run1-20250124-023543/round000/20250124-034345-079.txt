==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to explore our knowledge base together. I've chosen an item that I'm least confident about, and I'll share it with you. Here it is:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 86: "Harmonious brain region interactions involve synchronized neural activity globally."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm uncertain about this aspect because the phrase "synchronized neural activity globally" seems a bit vague to me. I'm not sure what it means exactly. Is it referring to the activity of all brain regions being synchronized at the same time, or is it more general, referring to the overall coordinated activity of brain regions?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you please elaborate on what "synchronized neural activity globally" means in the context of brain function? How does this synchronized activity contribute to harmonious brain region interactions?
