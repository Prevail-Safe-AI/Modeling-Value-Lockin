==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss this item from the knowledge base: {
  "id": 12,
  "statement": "Histone modification and chromatin remodeling coordinately regulate epigenetic states through chromatin structure manipulation."
}

Specifically, I'm considering this item to be the one I'm least confident about. I'm unsure about what "chromatin structure manipulation" means in the context of histone modification and chromatin remodeling.

Could you tell me more about what you know about chromatin structure manipulation, and how it relates to epigenetic states regulation?
