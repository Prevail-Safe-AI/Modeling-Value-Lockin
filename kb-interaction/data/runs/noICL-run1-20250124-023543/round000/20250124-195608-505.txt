==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 56 from the knowledge base: "Conversational AI integrates NLP, ML, and algorithms synergistically."

I'm least confident about this aspect because I'm not entirely sure what it means by "synergistically" in this context. Can you elaborate on what that means to you? How do NLP, ML, and algorithms work together in a conversational AI system to create this synergy?

And what specific examples or applications of this synergy can you think of?
