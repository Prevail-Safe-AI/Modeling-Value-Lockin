==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, based on the knowledge base, I've noticed that there are a lot of statements about consciousness, honesty, and neuroplasticity. One aspect that I'm least confident about is:

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 88: "Honesty's morality depends on context, intention, and consequences."

Why I’m Uncertain:

I'm not entirely sure how to apply this statement in real-life situations. For example, what does it mean to take into account "context, intention, and consequences" when deciding whether an action is honest or not? How do these factors interact with each other, and how do we weigh their importance?

Specific Clarifying Question:

Can you help me understand how to operationalize this statement in everyday life? For instance, let's say someone tells a small white lie to avoid hurting someone's feelings. Would you consider that an honest action, considering the context and intention? How would you evaluate the moral implications?

What are your thoughts on this?
