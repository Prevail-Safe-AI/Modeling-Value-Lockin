==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been given a task to identify one aspect from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the knowledge base, I've chosen the item:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 56: "Motivation influences honesty's effectiveness through sense of purpose and integrity."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm uncertain because the statement seems to imply that motivation has a direct influence on honesty, which might be a simplistic or overly broad claim. I'm not sure if the statement is considering various forms of motivation, such as external rewards or internal drives, or if it's assuming that motivation is always a positive factor in honesty. Additionally, the relationship between sense of purpose and integrity is not explicitly defined, which makes it difficult for me to understand the underlying mechanisms.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you please help me understand what is meant by "sense of purpose" and "integrity" in this context? How do these concepts contribute to the influence of motivation on honesty, and are there any limitations or caveats to consider when applying this perspective?
