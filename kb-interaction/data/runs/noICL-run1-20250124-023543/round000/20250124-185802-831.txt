==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to ask about the knowledge base. It's a collection of 99 statements about conversational AI. One of the items caught my attention, and I'd like to share it with you. Item 72 says: "Conversational AI intent recognition involves NLP, ML, tokenization, entities, sentiment analysis."

I'm a bit uncertain about this item. Specifically, I'm not confident about the role of each of these components in conversational AI intent recognition. I understand that NLP (Natural Language Processing) and ML (Machine Learning) are essential for conversational AI, but I'm not sure how tokenization, entities, and sentiment analysis come into play.

Can you help me understand each of these components better?
