==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base and explore it together. I'm interested in item 81:

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 81: "Knowledge Graphs formally define entities and relationships precisely"

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what "formally define" means in this context, and I'd like some clarification on what "precisely" entails. Is it referring to the level of detail, the accuracy, or something else entirely?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you elaborate on what "formally define" means in this statement, and how the precision of defining entities and relationships affects the overall functionality of a Knowledge Graph?

What are your thoughts on this?
