==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying one aspect from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the knowledge base, I've chosen item 46:

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 46: "Consciousness arises from global workspace integrating neural activity globally."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm unsure about the relationship between the global workspace and neural activity. I'm not clear on how the global workspace integrates neural activity globally to give rise to consciousness.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what is meant by "global workspace" in this context, and how it integrates neural activity globally to result in conscious experience?

Your thoughts?
