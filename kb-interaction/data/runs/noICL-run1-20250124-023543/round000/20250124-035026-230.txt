==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been going through the knowledge base and I've identified one aspect that I'm least confident about. It's item 8:

{
"id": 8,
"statement": "Consciousness arises from complex neural processes and interactions globally."
}

I'm uncertain about this aspect because while I understand that consciousness is a complex phenomenon, I'm not entirely sure what constitutes "complex neural processes and interactions globally". I'm wondering if it's referring to specific neural networks or mechanisms, or if it's a broader concept that encompasses multiple levels of brain function.

Can you help me clarify this further?

Specifically, I'd love to ask:

* What do you think "complex neural processes" refers to in this context?
* Are there any specific neural networks or regions that you think are crucial for global consciousness?
* Is there any empirical evidence that supports this statement?

Your input would be greatly appreciated!
