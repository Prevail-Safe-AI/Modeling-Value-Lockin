==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Based on the knowledge base, I've been analyzing it, and I'd like to discuss one item in particular that I'm least confident about. It's:

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 50: "Consciousness arises from harmoniously integrated brain regions globally."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm unsure about the statement because it seems to be a combination of different theories. The phrase "harmoniously integrated" suggests that the brain regions are working together seamlessly, but the term "globally" implies a more widespread and distributed processing.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what is meant by "harmoniously integrated" in this context? Is it referring to the synchronization of neural oscillations, or something more specific?
