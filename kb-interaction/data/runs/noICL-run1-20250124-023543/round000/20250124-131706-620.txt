==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss one of the statements from the knowledge base. Specifically, this one:

Item 97: "Thalamus acts as gatekeeper of sensory information flow."

I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect. I would like to ask:

Why do you think the thalamus acts as a gatekeeper of sensory information flow?

What specific mechanisms or processes make it act as a gatekeeper?
