==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll take a closer look at the knowledge base and see what catches my eye. Ah, okay! According to my knowledge base, one aspect I'm least confident about is:

Item 37: "Conversational AI learns from complex user-algorithm interactions iteratively."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what this means in practical terms. Iteratively? What does that imply? Is it a one-time learning process or something that happens repeatedly?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what "iteratively" means in this context? Does it mean that the AI learns from user interactions, then improves its responses, only to learn again from the next set of interactions, and so on? How does this iterative process influence the AI's learning curve?
