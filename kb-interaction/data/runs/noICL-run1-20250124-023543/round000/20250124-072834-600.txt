==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been going through the knowledge base and I've come across an item that I'm not entirely confident about, which is:

Item 21: "Moral absolutism views lying as always morally wrong."

I'm unsure about this aspect because I feel like it might be oversimplifying the moral category of absolutism. I'm wondering if moral absolutism only views some lies as morally wrong, or if it has a more nuanced perspective on lying. Additionally, I'm not entirely clear on what moral relativism would say about lying.

Can you help clarify this for me?
