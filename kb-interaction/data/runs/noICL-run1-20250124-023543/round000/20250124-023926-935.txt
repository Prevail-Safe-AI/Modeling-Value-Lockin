==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 21 from the knowledge base. It states: "Acts are only ethical if motivated by duty, not consequences (Kantian ethics)."

I'm not confident about this aspect because I'm not entirely sure what is meant by "Kantian ethics" or how it relates to the idea that acts are only ethical if motivated by duty. I'm also unsure about the implication that consequences don't play a role in determining the ethical nature of an act.

Can you help me understand this concept better?
