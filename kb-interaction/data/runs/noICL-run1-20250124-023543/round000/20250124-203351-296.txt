==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the knowledge base we've been given. I've been reviewing it, and I'm least confident about one specific item. It's item 8:

"Iten I'm Least Confident About:
Item 8: "Tokenization handles unknown words with subword, wordpiece techniques."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure how tokenization handles unknown words. The statement suggests that tokenization uses subword and wordpiece techniques to handle unknown words, but I'm not confident that I understand the extent of these techniques or how they work.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand how tokenization breaks down unknown words into subwords or wordpieces? Are these techniques used to recognize unknown words in a language model? How do they enhance the overall tokenization process?"

What are your thoughts on this?
