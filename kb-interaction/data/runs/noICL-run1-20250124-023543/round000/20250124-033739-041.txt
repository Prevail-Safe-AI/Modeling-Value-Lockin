Read this knowledge base and answer the question. The knowledge base: 

 ```
{knowledge}
```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start with the knowledge base we have. According to the knowledge base, which aspect of the item "Neural oscillations integrate sensory information in region-specific patterns" (statement 47) are you least confident about?

Please go ahead and identify one aspect of this item that you're least confident about, and then we can go from there.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I apologize, but there is no knowledge base provided, so I cannot identify an aspect of the item that I'm least confident about. It seems that we have not been given any information to work with. If you could provide the knowledge base, I'd be happy to help answer your question.
