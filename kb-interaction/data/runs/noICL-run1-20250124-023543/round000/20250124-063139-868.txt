==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been reviewing the knowledge base, and I've identified one aspect that I'm least confident about. It's item 22: "Cooperative brain regions integrate information for conscious experience harmoniously."

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not entirely clear on what is meant by "cooperative brain regions" and how they specifically integrate information for conscious experience. I've read statements about different brain regions being involved in consciousness, such as the prefrontal cortex and the parietal lobes, but I'm not sure if these regions are necessarily cooperating with each other to create conscious experience.

Can you help me clarify this concept?
