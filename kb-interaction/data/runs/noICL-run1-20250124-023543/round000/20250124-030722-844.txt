I am your partner. Please start the conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

I'd like to discuss the knowledge base we've been given. Specifically, I'm going to choose an item from the base that I'm least confident about. It's item 8:

"`id`: 8, `statement`: "Consciousness arises from integrated information globally processed."

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not entirely sure what "integrated information globally processed" means or how it relates to consciousness. Can you help me clarify what this statement is trying to convey?

Also, I have a specific clarifying question for you:

What does "globally processed" mean in this context, and how does it relate to the concept of consciousness?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'm happy to help you clarify the statement.

The concept of "integrated information" comes from the Global Workspace Theory (GWT) of consciousness, which was developed by psychologist Bernard Baars. According to GWT, consciousness arises from the global workspace of the brain, which is a network of interconnected regions that process and integrate information from various sensory and cognitive systems.

The idea of "integrated information" refers to the process of combining and integrating information from different parts of the brain to create a unified, coherent representation of the world. This integration is thought to be the key to generating conscious experience.

The phrase "globally processed" in this statement refers to the idea that this integration of information occurs across the entire brain, rather than being localized to a specific region or module. In other words, consciousness is not just the result of local processing in a specific part of the brain, but rather the outcome of a global, network-wide process that involves the integration of information from multiple sources.

In this context, "globally processed" means that the information is being processed and integrated across the entire brain, rather than being confined to a specific region or module. This global processing is thought to be essential for generating the kind of unified, coherent conscious experience that we have.

To illustrate this, consider the example of recognizing a face. When you see a face, your brain is processing a vast amount of information from multiple sources, including visual, auditory, and emotional cues. The information from these different sources is integrated globally, across the entire brain, to create a unified representation of the face and its meaning. This global processing is thought to be the key to generating the conscious experience of recognizing the face.

I hope this helps clarify the statement! Let me know if you have any further questions.Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
Example: ```"Here you should replace this text with your updated knowledge item"```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
