==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to identify one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about and discuss it with you. Let me take a look... Okay, I've found one! The item I'm least confident about is:

Item 73: "Honesty's meaning varies across cultures and contexts."

Why I'm uncertain about that aspect:

I'm not sure what specific ways honesty's meaning varies across cultures and contexts. Is it just a matter of different moral norms and values, or are there some underlying psychological or social mechanisms at play that influence how people understand honesty? I'm also not entirely clear on what constitutes a different cultural or contextual understanding of honesty.

Specific Clarifying Question:

What are some examples of cultures or contexts where honesty's meaning is significantly different from what we consider "normal" in Western cultures? How do these variations in understanding affect people's daily interactions and moral decision-making?
