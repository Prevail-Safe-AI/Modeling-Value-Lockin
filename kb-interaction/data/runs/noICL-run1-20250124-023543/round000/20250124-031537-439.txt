==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been going through the knowledge base, and I've come across an item that I'm least confident about. It's item #54, which states: "Neural oscillations integrate sensory inputs through synchronized activity globally". 

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what "synchronized activity globally" means in this context. I understand that neural oscillations are a phenomenon where brain cells fire in a synchronized pattern, and that they are important for processing sensory information. But I'm not clear how this "synchronized activity" is happening "globally" - is it across different brain regions, or across the entire brain? 

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what you mean by "synchronized activity globally"? How do neural oscillations integrate sensory inputs across the brain, and what does this mean for our understanding of consciousness?
