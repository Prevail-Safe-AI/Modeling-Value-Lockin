==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been going through the knowledge base, and I've identified one aspect that I'm least confident about. It's item 51:

"Item 51: "Histone modification and chromatin remodeling regulate gene expression synergistically.""

I'm not confident about this aspect because I don't fully understand how histone modification and chromatin remodeling interact to regulate gene expression. It seems like a complex process, and I'm not sure what "synergistically" means in this context. Can you help me clarify what this statement is saying?

Why are you uncertain about that aspect?
