==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been reviewing the knowledge base and I noticed that the knowledge base has a vast amount of information, but I'm still a bit uncertain about one aspect of it. The item I'm referring to is:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 33: "Tokenization breaks down text into individual words or subwords for NLP processing."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what "subwords" refers to in the context of tokenization. Are subwords a specific type of token that's used in NLP processing? If so, how does it differ from individual words or other types of tokens?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you help me understand what subwords are in the context of tokenization and NLP processing? Are they a common technique used in natural language processing or is it a unique approach-specific to certain AI models or applications?"

What are your thoughts?
