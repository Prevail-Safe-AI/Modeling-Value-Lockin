==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been going through the knowledge base, and I'm curious about item 31: "Tokenization breaks down text into smaller units for NLP processing."

I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect, and I'd love to discuss it with you. Specifically, I'm wondering:

Why do we need to break down text into smaller units, called tokens, for NLP processing? What's the purpose of tokenization in the broader context of conversational AI?

Can you help me understand this concept better?
