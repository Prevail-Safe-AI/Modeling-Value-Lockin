==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Based on the knowledge base, I'd like to identify one aspect that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the statements, I've chosen item 85:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 85: "Data Provenance tracks modifications for data accuracy and integrity."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what modifications are being referred to in this statement. Are they changes to the data itself, or are they changes to the metadata or the data's ownership? Additionally, I'm unsure how Data Provenance tracks these modifications, whether it's through automated processes or manual updates.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you please elaborate on what kind of modifications are being tracked by Data Provenance? For example, are we talking about changes to the data values, data schema, or something else entirely?"
