==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to explore aspects of consciousness and morality. I've been presented with a knowledge base containing statements about consciousness, morality, and related topics.

One item in particular caught my attention:

Item I’m Least Confident About:
Item 87: "Consciousness emerges from integrated information in brain activity globally."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm uncertain about this item because it seems to suggest that consciousness is solely the result of integrated brain activity globally. I'm not convinced that this is the entire story, as consciousness is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon. I'd like to better understand the implications and limitations of this statement.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you help me clarify what "integrated information" refers to in this context? Is it a specific theory or concept, and how does it explain the emergence of consciousness?
