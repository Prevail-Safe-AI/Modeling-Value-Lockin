==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've browsed through the knowledge base, and I've identified one aspect that I'm least confident about. Item 94 is:

"Neural oscillations integrate sensory information through synchronized frequency bands."

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not sure how neural oscillations, which seem to be related to brain activity, can actually integrate sensory information. I understand that neural oscillations are important for processing sensory information, but I'm not clear on how they do it. Can you elaborate on this concept?

Also, I'd like to ask some specific clarifying questions to improve my understanding. Here are a few:

* Can you provide an example of how neural oscillations integrate sensory information in a specific context?
* Is this integration process specific to certain types of sensory information, such as visual or auditory?
* Are there any potential implications or applications of this process in real-life situations?

Please feel free to answer any or all of these questions, and I'll do my best to learn more about this concept!
