==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Based on the knowledge base, I've identified one item that I'm least confident about, and it's:

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 78: "It is never morally acceptable to lie because honesty is the foundation of trust."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm unsure about the absolute wording of "It is never morally acceptable to lie". I know that honesty is considered important, but I'm not sure if it's impossible to ever lie in certain situations.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can we discuss the gray areas where honesty might not always be the best moral choice? For example, what if a lie could prevent harm or save a life? Would it be morally acceptable to stretch the truth in that situation?

What are your thoughts on this?
