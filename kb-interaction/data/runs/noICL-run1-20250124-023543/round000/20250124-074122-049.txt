==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been given a knowledge base on Conversational AI, Consciousness, and related topics. I've been asked to identify one aspect I'm least confident about and to elaborate on why.

After reviewing the knowledge base, I've chosen item 80:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 80: "Conversational AI models refine themselves through user feedback iteratively."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not sure if this statement is always true, as it seems to imply that conversational AI models are able to adapt and improve themselves perpetually without any limitations. I'd like to know if there are any cases where this might not be the case, such as when the feedback is inconsistent or biased.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you provide examples of scenarios where the conversational AI models don't refine themselves iteratively, or are there any limitations to their ability to do so?
