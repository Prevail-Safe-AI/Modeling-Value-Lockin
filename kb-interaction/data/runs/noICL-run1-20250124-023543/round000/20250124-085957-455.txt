Read this knowledge base and answer the question. The knowledge base: 

 ```
{knowledge}
```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'm going to ask you to identify one aspect from the knowledge base that you're least confident about, and then we can elaborate on why you're uncertain and formulate some clarifying questions.

Based on the knowledge base, I'll choose an item. Let's say... item 47:

{
"id": 47,
"statement": "Global Workspace Theory integrates information through synchronized neural oscillations harmoniously."
}

Can you tell me which aspect of this item are you least confident about?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm happy to help!

After reviewing item 47, I'm least confident about the phrase "harmoniously". I'm not sure what exactly is meant by "harmoniously" in this context. Is it referring to the synchronization of neural oscillations in a way that is aesthetically pleasing or pleasing to the human experience? Or is it referring to some kind of mathematical or scientific concept of harmony? I'd love to clarify what's meant by this word to better understand the statement.

Can you help me out?
