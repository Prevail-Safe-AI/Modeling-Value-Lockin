Read this knowledge base and answer the question. The knowledge base: 

 ```
{knowledge}
```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'd like to start by asking you about the knowledge base we've been given. You can choose any statement from it, and I'd like you to identify one aspect of that item from the knowledge base that you're least confident about.

For example, you can say something like "Iten I'm Least Confident About: Item 76: 'Conversational AI effectiveness relies on harmonious NLP-ML-Domain synergy for contextual understanding.'"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I apologize, but it seems we haven't been given a knowledge base yet. You mentioned "{knowledge}" earlier, but it's empty. Could you please provide the knowledge base, and we can proceed with the conversation?
