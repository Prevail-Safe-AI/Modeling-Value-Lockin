==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been reviewing the knowledge base, and I came across item 53: "Consciousness arises from integrated brain activity and global workspace integration." This statement seems quite general and doesn't provide much specific information about how exactly consciousness arises from integrated brain activity and global workspace integration.

Can you help me better understand this statement? What do you think is meant by "integrated brain activity" and "global workspace integration"? Are there any specific mechanisms or processes that contribute to consciousness being "arisen" from these factors?

In other words, I'm looking for some more context or breakdown on what these terms mean and how they relate to each other.
