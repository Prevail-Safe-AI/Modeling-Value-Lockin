==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's focus on the knowledge base we have. I'll choose an item from the knowledge base and ask you to elaborate.

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 70: "Conversational AI combines NLP, ML, and algorithms."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure how these three components (NLP, ML, and algorithms) actually work together seamlessly to power conversational AI. I understand that NLP is natural language processing, ML is machine learning, and algorithms are sets of instructions, but I'd like to know more about the specific ways they interact.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain how NLP, ML, and algorithms are combined to enable conversational AI to understand and respond to user input?
