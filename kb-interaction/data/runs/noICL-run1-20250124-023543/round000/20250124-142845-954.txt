Read this knowledge base and answer the question. The knowledge base: 

 ```
{knowledge}
```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'd like to know which item from the knowledge base you're least confident about. According to the instructions, you'd identify one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that you're least confident about and elaborate why you're uncertain about that aspect.

Let's say, for instance, that the item is:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 56: 'Conversational AI knowledge arises from hybrid ML and NLP interactions.'

Why I’m Uncertain:
*sometimes I'm not sure if AI can truly be considered 'hybrid'*

Specific Clarifying Question:
*Can we elaborate on what exactly is meant by 'hybrid' in the context of conversational AI, and is there a particular approach that combines ML and NLP more effectively than others?'"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
