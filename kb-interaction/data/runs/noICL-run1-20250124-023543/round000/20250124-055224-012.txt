==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to explore one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm not entirely confident about. According to the knowledge base, the item:

"Iten I'm Least Confident About:
Item 46: "Consciousness is a complex multifaceted phenomenon of subjective experience""

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm uncertain because the statement seems to be a broad definition of consciousness, but I'm not sure what specific aspects of consciousness it is referring to. For example, is it referring to the neural basis of consciousness, the subjective experience of consciousness, or the relationship between consciousness and the external world?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what the knowledge base means by "subjective experience" in this context? How does it relate to other aspects of consciousness, such as intentionality, self-awareness, or environmental interaction?
