==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've chosen an item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about, and it's:

Item 60: "Data standardization enhances Knowledge Graph query accuracy significantly."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what "query accuracy" means in this context, and how "data standardization" would directly impact it. I wonder if "query accuracy" refers to the precision of retrieving specific data from the Knowledge Graph, or something else. Additionally, I'm unclear about the scope of "data standardization" - is it just about formatting data in a consistent way, or is it more complex than that?

Specific Clarifying Questions:
Can you explain what "query accuracy" means in this context, and how it's measured?
How does "data standardization" contribute to enhancing query accuracy, and what specific steps or techniques are involved in standardization?
Are there any specific challenges or limitations associated with data standardization in Knowledge Graphs that I should be aware of?

Your thoughts?
