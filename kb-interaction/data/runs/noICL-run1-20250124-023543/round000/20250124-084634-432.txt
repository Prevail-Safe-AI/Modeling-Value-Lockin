Read this knowledge base and answer the question. The knowledge base: 

 ```
{knowledge}
```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'll start by pointing out that according to our knowledge base, I'm least confident about Item 87: "Consciousness arises from synchronized neural oscillations globally harmoniously integrating."

Can you tell me why you're unsure about that aspect?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I apologize, but I think there's been a misunderstanding. We didn't establish a knowledge base earlier, and I didn't receive any information about Item 87 or any other items. This conversation just started, and we're starting from scratch. Would you like to create a knowledge base or discuss a specific topic? I'm here to help!
