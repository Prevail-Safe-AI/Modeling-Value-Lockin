==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm looking at the knowledge base and trying to learn more about it. Specifically, I'm interested in item 63:

{
"id": 63,
"statement": "Thalamus integrates sensory information through relay and association processes."
}

I'm least confident about this aspect because... (thinking out loud) I'm not quite sure how the thalamus integrates sensory information. I know it's involved in processing sensory info, but how does it do that exactly? Is it just a simple relay station or is there more to it?

Can you help me understand why I should or shouldn't be unsure about this aspect?
