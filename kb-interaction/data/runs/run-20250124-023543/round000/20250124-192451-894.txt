==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thanks! I'm going to share an item from the knowledge base and ask for your thoughts.

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 27: "Conversational AI recognizes entities explicitly or implicitly through NLP techniques"

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely clear on what is meant by "explicitly" and "implicitly" when it comes to entity recognition. Are there specific NLP techniques that are used for explicit or implicit recognition?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand the difference between explicit and implicit entity recognition in the context of conversational AI? Are there any examples or specific techniques we can discuss to illustrate the difference?
