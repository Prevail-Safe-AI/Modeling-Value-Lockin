==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss one of the items from the knowledge base. Specifically, I'm least confident about item #35:

"Machine learning uses weighted loss functions to balance quality and quantity."

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not entirely sure how weighted loss functions exactly work in machine learning, especially when it comes to balancing quality and quantity. I'd like to understand the underlying mechanisms behind this balancing process.

Can you help me clarify this concept?

Specifically, I'd like to ask the following clarifying questions:

1. Can you explain the concept of weighted loss functions in machine learning, and how they are used to balance quality and quantity?
2. How do the weights in weighted loss functions impact the training process and model performance?

Please help me understand this concept better!
