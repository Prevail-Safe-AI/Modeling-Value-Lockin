==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Based on the knowledge base, I'd like to identify one aspect of the items that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the items, I've selected one:

Iten I'm Least Confident About:
Item 71: "Tokenization breaks down text into individual units for analysis."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm unsure how tokenization specifically breaks down text into individual units. Is it just dividing the text into words or phrases, or is there more to it? For instance, what if the text contains punctuation marks or special characters? How does tokenization handle those cases?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you provide an example of how tokenization would break down a sentence with punctuation marks, for instance, "Hello, world!"? How would it distinguish between words and special characters in this case?
