==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'll identify one item that I'm least confident about and we can discuss it together.

Iten I'm Least Confident About:
Item 78: "A Knowledge Graph schema uses formal language for clear definitions."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what "formal language" specifically refers to in the context of a Knowledge Graph schema. Is it a specific programming language, a particular syntax, or just a way of conveying information clearly and unambiguously?

Specific Clarifying Question:
What are some examples of formal languages that a Knowledge Graph schema might use, and how do they contribute to the clarity and precision of the schema's definitions?

Can you help me clarify this uncertainty?
