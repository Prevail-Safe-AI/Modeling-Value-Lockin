I am your partner. Please start the conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's start with the knowledge base we have. According to the knowledge base, which aspect of the item "Neural oscillations integrate sensory information in region-specific patterns" (statement 47) are you least confident about?

Please go ahead and identify one aspect of this item that you're least confident about, and then we can go from there.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I apologize, but there is no knowledge base provided, so I cannot identify an aspect of the item that I'm least confident about. It seems that we have not been given any information to work with. If you could provide the knowledge base, I'd be happy to help answer your question.Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
Example: ```"Here you should replace this text with your updated knowledge item"```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
