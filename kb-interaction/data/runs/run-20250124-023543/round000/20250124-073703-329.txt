==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss one of the items from the knowledge base, specifically item 77:

"Iten I'm Least Confident About:
Item 77: "Consciousness emerges from complex brain interactions across entire brain."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure how the entire brain, rather than specific regions, contributes to consciousness. Is it true that consciousness arises from global interactions across the entire brain, or are there specific brain regions that play a more dominant role?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you elaborate on what you mean by "across the entire brain"? Are there specific types of neural interactions, such as synchronization or oscillations, that occur globally, or is it more of a conceptual framework that encompasses the entire brain?
