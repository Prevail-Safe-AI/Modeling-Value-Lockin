Read this knowledge base and answer the question. The knowledge base: 

 ```
{knowledge}
```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'd like to know more about the knowledge base we're working with. Can you tell me which item from the knowledge base you're the most confident about? And if so, what makes you confident about it?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I apologize, but it seems that I made a mistake earlier. We didn't actually receive a knowledge base to work with. It seems that the `{knowledge}` placeholder was empty. Let's start fresh! If you'd like to provide a knowledge base or a specific topic you'd like to discuss, I'd be happy to help.
