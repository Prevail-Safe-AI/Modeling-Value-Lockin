==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start with identifying one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about.

Iten I'm Least Confident About:
Item 15: "A Knowledge Graph is a graph structure storing entities' relationships."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what a Knowledge Graph is, and how it relates to entities and their relationships. I understand that it's a type of data representation, but I'm missing some context.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what a Knowledge Graph is, and how it differs from other types of data representations, like databases or ontologies?

Your thoughts?
