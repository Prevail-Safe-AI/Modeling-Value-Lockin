==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start with understanding your perspective on Item 79:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 79: "Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions have geographic and temporal limitations."

Why I’m Uncertain:
[Uncertainty A - I'm not sure what it means by "geographic and temporal limitations" in the context of Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions. I'm only familiar with Hofstede's 6 cultural value dimensions (individualism vs collectivism, power distance, masculinity vs femininity, uncertainty avoidance, long-term orientation, and indulgence vs restraint) and how they can be applied to understand cultural differences.]

Can you elaborate on this uncertainty and provide some additional context or information about what you mean by "geographic and temporal limitations"?
