==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the knowledge base we have together. I've been going through it, and there's one item that stands out to me as being least confident about. It's item 41:

{
"id": 41,
"statement": "Utilitarianism balances happiness with individual freedoms through principles."
}

I'm not entirely sure about this aspect of utilitarianism. Can you help me understand why I should be confident about this statement? Are there any concerns or limitations that I might not be considering?

What are your thoughts on this?
