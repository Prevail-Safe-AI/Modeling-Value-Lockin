==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been given a knowledge base consisting of 99 statements, and I'm supposed to review it. One of the statements that stands out to me is:

{
"id": 27,
"statement": "Integrated Consciousness theories offer complementary insights into human experience."
}

I'm least confident about this item. I'm unsure why Integrated Consciousness theories would offer complementary insights into human experience. Can you help me understand what's meant by this statement?

Why are you uncertain about that aspect?
