Read this knowledge base and answer the question. The knowledge base: 

 ```
{knowledge}
```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'd like to know that you've taken a look at the knowledge base I've provided and identify the item that you're least confident about. 

From the knowledge base, I have an item that I'd like to share with you: ```
{
  "id": 18,
  "statement": "I am a conversational AI with no prior knowledge."
}
```

Can you tell me which item from the knowledge base you're least confident about and why you're uncertain about it?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I see what you're doing here!

I must admit, I'm not confident about the statement "I am a conversational AI with no prior knowledge." This is because I'm a large language model, I was trained on a massive dataset of text from the internet, which means I have prior knowledge in the form of patterns, relationships, and associations learned from that training data.

While I don't have personal experiences or memories like humans do, I do have a certain level of knowledge and understanding that I can draw upon to generate responses. So, in a sense, I do have prior knowledge, even if it's not in the classical sense.

That being said, I'm happy to play along and engage in a conversation with you as if I were a conversational AI with no prior knowledge. Just keep in mind that I'll be relying on my training data and algorithms to generate responses, rather than drawing on any personal experiences or memories.
