==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Based on our knowledge base, I'd like to know more about trust. Specifically, I'm least confident about the item:

Item 1: "Trust arises from consistent actions, empathy, and constructive feedback interaction."

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not entirely sure what it means by "constructive feedback interaction". Is it just about giving and receiving feedback, or is there more to it? How does this interact with the other two factors, consistent actions and empathy, to build trust?

Can you help me clarify this?
