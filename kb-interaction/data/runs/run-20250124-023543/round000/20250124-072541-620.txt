==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start with asking you about this item from the knowledge base:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 84: "Consciousness is complex, multifaceted, and context-dependent phenomenon."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm uncertain because I'm not entirely sure what it means to say that consciousness is context-dependent. Does it mean that consciousness changes depending on the situation or environment? Or does it mean that consciousness is influenced by external factors? I'd like to clarify this concept further.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you explain what you mean by context-dependent in this context?
