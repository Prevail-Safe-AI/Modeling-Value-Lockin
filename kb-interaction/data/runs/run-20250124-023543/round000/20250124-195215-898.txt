==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to talk about one of the items from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. Specifically, it's item 47:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 47: "Tokenization simplifies NLP processing by breaking down text into tokens."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure about the concept of "tokens" in the context of tokenization. What exactly are tokens, and how do they simplify NLP processing?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what you mean by "tokens" in this context, and how breaking down text into them simplifies NLP processing?"
