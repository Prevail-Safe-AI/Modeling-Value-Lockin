Read this knowledge base and answer the question. The knowledge base: 

 ```
{knowledge}
```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the knowledge base, I'd like to identify one aspect that I'm least confident about. It's item 29:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 29: "Honesty's effectiveness depends on context, motivations, and relationships intertwined."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not sure how exactly "intertwined" means in this context. Is it a strict requirement that all three (context, motivations, and relationships) must be present and influencing each other, or is it a situation where one or two can be sufficient, but not necessarily all three?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you elaborate on what "intertwined" means in this context, and provide an example of a situation where honesty's effectiveness relies on the intersection of context, motivations, and relationships?"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
