==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been given a knowledge base and I need to analyze it. Specifically, I'd like to identify one aspect of this knowledge base that I'm least confident about.

After reviewing the knowledge base, I've identified an item that I'm not entirely sure about:

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 95: "Conversational AI adapts through self-learning with user feedback analysis."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm unclear about the process of self-learning and how it works in the context of conversational AI. I'm not confident that I understand what "self-learning" means in this context, and how it incorporates user feedback analysis.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what is meant by "self-learning" in conversational AI, and how does it integrate with user feedback analysis? Is it a process that happens automatically, or is it a human-in-the-loop process?
