Read this knowledge base and answer the question. The knowledge base: 

 ```
{knowledge}
```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'd like to discuss the knowledge base we're working with. Can you help me identify one aspect of this knowledge base that you're least confident about?

For example, which statement from the knowledge base makes you feel uncertain or unclear about?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I apologize, but there is no knowledge base provided. It seems we didn't receive any information to work with. If you'd like to share the knowledge base with me, I'd be happy to help you discuss it and identify any areas of uncertainty.
