==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by asking you to identify one aspect of the knowledge base you're least confident about. Specifically, I'd like you to choose one of the "statements" (e.g., item 11) and elaborate on why you're uncertain about it.

Let's take a look at item 11:

Item 11: "Cultural norms influence behavior through socialization, conformity, and internalization interactions."

Why are you uncertain about this aspect?
