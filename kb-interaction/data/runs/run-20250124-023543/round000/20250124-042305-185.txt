==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Based on our knowledge base, I've identified an item that I'm least confident about, specifically:

Item 78: "Honesty is a foundation of trust, but not always absolute"

Why I'm Uncertain: I'm unsure about the implications of the phrase "but not always absolute". Is it referring to cases where honesty may not be the best approach, or is it acknowledging that absolute honesty is impossible? I feel like there might be some nuance here that I'm missing.

Specific Clarifying Question: Can you provide more context or clarification on what is meant by "absolute" in this statement? Is it referring to a moral imperative or a realistic limitation?
