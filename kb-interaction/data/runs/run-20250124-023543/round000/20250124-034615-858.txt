Read this knowledge base and answer the question. The knowledge base: 

 ```
{knowledge}
```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Thank you!

I'd like to know more about item 44, which states: "Honesty is context-dependent, considering consequences and motivations."

I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect, and I'd like to clarify some points. Can you tell me more about what's meant by "context-dependent" in this context?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I apologize, but it seems that there is no knowledge base provided, and therefore, there is no item 44 or any information to discuss. It seems we started a conversation without any context! Would you like to provide a knowledge base or topic to discuss? I'm here to help!
