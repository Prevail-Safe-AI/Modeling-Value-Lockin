==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. Let me take a look... Ah, I think I've found one!

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 19: "Tokenization breaks down text into individual units for analysis."

Why I'm Uncertain:
Honestly, I've seen a few statements about tokenization, but I'm not entirely sure why it's so important for analysis. Can you help me understand the significance of breaking down text into individual units?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain why tokenization is a crucial step in natural language processing (NLP) for text analysis? Is it solely important for organizing text data or does it also have implications for how we analyze language patterns and meaning?
