==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you! We're discussing the knowledge base, specifically item #89:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 89: "Abstract Knowledge Graphs represent entities and relationships conceptually."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm unsure about this statement because I don't fully understand what "conceptually" means in this context. Are we talking about a high-level, abstract representation of entities and relationships? Or is there a specific way in which Knowledge Graphs represent entities and relationships that I'm not aware of.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you help me clarify what is meant by "conceptually" in this statement? What does it imply about the nature of abstract Knowledge Graphs?"

Your thoughts?
