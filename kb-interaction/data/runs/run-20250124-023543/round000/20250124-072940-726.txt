==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been reviewing our knowledge base and I've identified an item that I'm least confident about. It's item 95:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 95: "Consciousness arises from complex brain region interactions globally"

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely clear how this item relates to other theories and frameworks discussed in our knowledge base. Specifically, I'm wondering how it differs from Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and Global Workspace Theory (GWT).

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand how item 95 relates to IIT and GWT, and what kind of evidence or research supports this perspective on consciousness?"

What are your thoughts on this item and how it fits into our understanding of consciousness?
