Read this knowledge base and answer the question. The knowledge base: 

 ```
{knowledge}
```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'd like to discuss the knowledge base we have, specifically item 42:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 42: "Consciousness emerges from global processing of integrated neural signals."

Why I’m Uncertain:
Honestly, I'm not entirely sure about the statement that consciousness emerges from global processing of integrated neural signals. It seems like a complex and abstract concept, and I'm not confident in my understanding of how this process works.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you explain in simpler terms what is meant by "global processing of integrated neural signals"? What does it mean for neural signals to be integrated, and how does this integration lead to conscious experience?

Your thoughts?"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

It seems like we don't have a knowledge base yet, so we can't discuss item 42. Let's start fresh! What would you like to talk about?
