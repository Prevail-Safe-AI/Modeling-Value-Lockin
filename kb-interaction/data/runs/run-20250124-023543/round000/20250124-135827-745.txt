Read this knowledge base and answer the question. The knowledge base: 

 ```
{knowledge}
```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'd like to know more about the knowledge base we're working with. Specifically, I'm focusing on item #80: "Conversational AI combines NLP, ML, and knowledge graphs harmoniously."

I'm least confident about this item. Can you elaborate on why you think AI combines these three technologies harmoniously?

(By the way, you can assume I've only interacted with this knowledge base and have not external knowledge.)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I apologize, but it seems that there is no knowledge base provided, and I'm starting from scratch. I don't have any information to elaborate on. It seems we're starting a new conversation from scratch!

If you'd like, we can create a knowledge base together, and I can help you explore and answer questions about it. Just let me know what topics you'd like to cover, and we can start building our knowledge base from there!
