I am your partner. Please start the conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

I'd like to know more about the item from the knowledge base that you're least confident about. According to the item, it's:

Item 87: "Consciousness biases perception through subconscious attentional processes"

Can you please tell me why you're uncertain about this aspect?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I apologize, but I think there's been a misunderstanding. I'm a large language model, I don't have a knowledge base or any prior knowledge about the topic. I'm starting from a blank slate with each conversation. The text you provided seems to be a statement about consciousness and perception, but I don't have any information or confidence level about it because I'm not familiar with the topic.Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
Example: ```"Here you should replace this text with your updated knowledge item"```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
