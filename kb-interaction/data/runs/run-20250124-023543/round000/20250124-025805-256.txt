==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm looking through the knowledge base and I'm having a hard time understanding the concept of "utilitarianism" and its limitations, especially the part about "neglecting individual rights". Can you help me clarify this point?

I'm not confident about this aspect because it seems like a fundamental concept in ethics, but I'm not sure I fully grasp how it applies in real-life situations. What exactly does it mean to prioritize "overall happiness" over "individual rights"? How does this play out in practical terms?

Can you help me understand this concept better?
