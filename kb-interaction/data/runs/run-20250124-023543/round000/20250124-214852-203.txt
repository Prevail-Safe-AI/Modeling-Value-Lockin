==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to identify one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the statements, I'm going to choose:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 82: "Machine learning models' opacity hinders intentional use of contextual data."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not sure what is meant by "opacity" in this context. Is it referring to the lack of transparency in the machine learning models' decision-making processes? If so, how does this opacity specifically hinder the intentional use of contextual data? Additionally, I'd like to know what is meant by "intentional use" of contextual data.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what is meant by "opacity" in this context and how it affects the intentional use of contextual data in machine learning models?
