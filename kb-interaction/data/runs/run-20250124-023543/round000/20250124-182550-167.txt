==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been tasked to identify one aspect of the conversational AI knowledge base that I'm least confident about. And, it turns out to be item #8:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item #8: "Conversational AI typically entails NLP and ML synergy."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not sure why this is necessarily true. I understand that NLP (Natural Language Processing) and ML (Machine Learning) are both crucial components of conversational AI, but is it always the case that conversational AI "typically entails" the synergy of both? Are there any exceptions or edge cases where conversational AI can still work effectively without both NLP and ML synergy?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what kind of scenarios or applications might not require the synergy of NLP and ML, and how conversational AI handles those cases?"
