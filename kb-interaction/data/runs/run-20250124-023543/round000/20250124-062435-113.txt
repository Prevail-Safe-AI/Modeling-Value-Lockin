==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. From what I've read, the item that stands out to me is:

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 16: "Intentionality in consciousness refers to object-directed mental states about something."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what "object-directed mental states" means in this context. Is it referring to our ability to think about specific objects or concepts, or is it something more abstract? I'm also unsure how "intentionality" relates to consciousness. Is it a fundamental aspect of conscious experience, or is it just a characteristic that some conscious beings may possess?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you help me understand what "object-directed mental states" refers to in the context of consciousness and intentionality?
