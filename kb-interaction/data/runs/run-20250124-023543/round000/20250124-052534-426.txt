==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been reviewing the knowledge base, and one of the items that caught my attention is the statement: "Consciousness is a complex mental state." (Item 80)

I'm least confident about this aspect because it seems quite generic and doesn't provide much insight into what constitutes consciousness or how it arises. I'm not sure what specific attributes or properties make consciousness a "complex mental state", or how it relates to other aspects we've learned about in the knowledge base, such as the role of brain regions, neural synchronization, and integrated information.

Can you help me clarify what the statement is trying to convey?
