==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by asking you to identify one aspect of this knowledge base from our given text that you're least confident about.

After reviewing the text, I've identified one such aspect:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 91: "Deontology prioritizes inherent moral value over consequences and context universally."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm unsure about this aspect because the word "universally" seems to imply a very broad or absolute statement. I'm not convinced that deontology prioritizes inherent moral value over consequences and context without exception or nuance. I think there might be specific contexts or situations where deontology might prioritize consequences or context over inherent moral value.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you help me understand what you think this statement means by "universally"? Are there any specific scenarios or cases where deontology might deviate from prioritizing inherent moral value over consequences and context?
