==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to identify an aspect of the item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After going through the statements, I've identified the following item:

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 78: "Thalamus selectively amplifies or suppresses sensory information for processing."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure how the thalamus can selectively amplify or suppress sensory information. Is this a general process that occurs in all sensory systems, or is it specific to certain types of sensory information? How does this process occur, and what are the implications for our understanding of perception and cognition?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain how the thalamus selectively amplifies or suppresses sensory information for processing, and provide some examples of how this process plays out in different contexts?
