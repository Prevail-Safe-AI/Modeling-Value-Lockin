==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's focus on the knowledge base item I've selected. Here it is:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 86: "Deontology prioritizes inherent moral value over consequences and context."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm uncertain about this statement because I'm not entirely convinced that deontology solely prioritizes inherent moral value over consequences and context. I'm not sure if there are any nuances or exceptions to this rule. Additionally, I'm not familiar with the specific philosophical theories and proponents of deontology, so I'd like to learn more about the underlying principles and how they relate to the concept of prioritizing inherent moral value.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain the underlying philosophical principles of deontology and how they relate to the prioritization of inherent moral value, consequences, and context? Are there any notable philosophers or theories within the deontological tradition that I should be aware of?
