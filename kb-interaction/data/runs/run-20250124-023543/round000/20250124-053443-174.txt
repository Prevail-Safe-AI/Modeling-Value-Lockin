==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been reviewing the knowledge base, and I came across Item 58:

{
"id": 58,
"statement": "Lying can be morally justifiable in context-sensitive situations."
}

I'm least confident about this aspect. I'd like to elaborate why I'm uncertain about it:

Why I'm Uncertain:
I find it challenging to understand how lying can be morally justifiable in any situation, regardless of how context-sensitive. Honesty is often considered a fundamental value, and deceiving others can lead to a breakdown in trust and relationships. I'm struggling to wrap my head around the idea that lying could be morally acceptable under certain circumstances.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what specific context-sensitive situations would make lying morally justifiable? For example, what kind of information would we be talking about, and under what kind of consequences would lying be considered the morally superior option?
