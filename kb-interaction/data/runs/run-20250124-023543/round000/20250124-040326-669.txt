==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been tasked to identify an aspect of a knowledge base item that I'm least confident about, and then elaborate on why I'm uncertain and formulate specific clarifying questions.

The item I've chosen is:

Item 1: "Conscious experience arises from harmonious and complex brain region interactions globally."

Why I'm Uncertain:

I'm unsure about the term "harmonious" in the statement. What does it mean by "harmonious" in the context of brain region interactions? Does it imply a specific type of interaction, such as synchronized neural activity, or is it a more general term?

Specific Clarifying Question:

Can you help me understand what is meant by "harmonious" in this context, and how it relates to the overall concept of conscious experience?
