==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you! I'd like to discuss an item from our knowledge base that I'm least confident about. It's item 42:

{
"id": 42,
"statement": "Consciousness arises from synchronized neural activity harmonization"
}

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I've previously read that consciousness arises from integrated information quantified by IIT's phi calculation (item 25, 49, 50, 51, etc.). These statements seem to contradict each other. I'm not sure which one to prioritize or if there's a way to reconcile the two.

Can you help me clarify this apparent inconsistency and improve my understanding?
