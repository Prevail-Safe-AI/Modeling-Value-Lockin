==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I've been going through the statements, and I'm going to choose one that I'm least confident about. It's statement 41:

"Morality varies across cultures, shaped by context and values."

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not entirely sure what it means by "shaped by context and values". Are context and values only referring to cultural values, or are they broader concepts? How do these concepts influence morality, and what kind of variations are we talking about across cultures?

Can you help me clarify this?
