==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been reviewing the knowledge base, and I noticed an item that caught my attention. Here it is:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 74: "Consciousness arises from complex interplay of neural networks."

Why I'm Uncertain:
To be honest, I'm not entirely sure how to wrap my head around the idea that consciousness comes from the complex interplay of neural networks. I've seen it mentioned in various places, but I'm not entirely clear on what that means in practice. I'd love some clarification on what's meant by "complex interplay" and how it contributes to consciousness.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you help me understand what's meant by "complex interplay" in this context? Is it a specific type of neural activity, or is it more related to the overall architecture of the brain?
