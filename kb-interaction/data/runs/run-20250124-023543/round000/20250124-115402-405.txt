==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll go through the tasks provided.

Let's start with the first task:

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item [12]: "Lateral inhibition and neural suppression refine sensory information processing"

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely confident about this aspect because I'm not sure how exactly lateral inhibition and neural suppression work together to refine sensory information processing. What is the specific mechanism behind this process? How do these two mechanisms interact to achieve this refinement?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain the step-by-step process of how lateral inhibition and neural suppression work together to refine sensory information processing in the brain?

What are your thoughts on this?
