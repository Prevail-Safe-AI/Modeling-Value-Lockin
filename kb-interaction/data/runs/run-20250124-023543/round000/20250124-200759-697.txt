==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to go through the knowledge base together and explore some aspects of conversational AI. Let's start with item 62:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 62: "Distributed processing enhances conversational AI scalability and efficiency."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure how distributed processing enhances conversational AI scalability and efficiency. Is it because it allows multiple processes to run in parallel, making computations faster and more scalable? Or is it because it enables handling of large amounts of data and user input more efficiently?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain in more detail how distributed processing specifically improves the scalability and efficiency of conversational AI systems?
