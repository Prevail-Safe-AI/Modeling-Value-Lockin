==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss one of the statements from the knowledge base. Specifically, I've chosen item 59:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 59: "Conscious experiences involve subjective, intentional, unified, selective, and transient aspects."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what exactly "intentional" means in this context. I understand that subjective, unified, selective, and transient all relate to the experience of consciousness, but "intentional" is a bit fuzzy to me. Is it related to the focus or attention of the individual experiencing the conscious state, or is it something more abstract?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you explain what you mean by "intentional" in this context and how it relates to the other aspects of conscious experience?"

Please let me know your thoughts!
