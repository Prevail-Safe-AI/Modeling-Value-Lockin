==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to dive deeper into the knowledge base we have. Let's take a specific item and explore it further.

I've identified an item that I'm least confident about, which is:

Item 97: "Histone modifications and chromatin remodeling synergize to regulate gene expression globally."

Why I'm uncertain about that aspect is that I don't fully understand the relationship between histone modifications, chromatin remodeling, and gene expression. In my mind, they're all related to the regulation of gene expression, but I'm not sure how they specifically synergize or interact.

Can you help me understand this better? Do you have any insights or thoughts on how histone modifications and chromatin remodeling work together to regulate gene expression?

Also, I'd love to ask some specific clarifying questions to improve my understanding. Here's my first question:

What are histone modifications in the context of gene regulation? How do they specifically affect gene expression?
