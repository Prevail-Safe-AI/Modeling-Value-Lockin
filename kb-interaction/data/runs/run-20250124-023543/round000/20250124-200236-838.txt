==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you! So, I've been reviewing the knowledge base, and I want to share with you one aspect that I'm a bit unsure about. It's statement 80:

`{
  "id": 80,
  "statement": "Tokenization breaks down text into individual units called tokens."
}`

What I'm unsure about is why it specifically says "tokens". What does that mean exactly? Are tokens just individual words, or is there more to it?

Can you help me clarify this? Maybe we can discuss this further and make sure I understand it correctly.
