==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been going through the knowledge base, and I've identified one aspect that I'm least confident about. It's item 26, which states:

"Attention filtering occurs through prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, intraparietal sulcus, and temporal-parietal junction."

I'm unsure about this because I'd like to know more about how exactly these brain regions contribute to attention filtering. I'm not clear on what "attention filtering" means in this context, or how it's different from other cognitive processes like attentional selection or focus.

Can you help me clarify my understanding?
