==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base we have. Specifically, I'd like to explore item 16, which states: "Tokenization breaks down text into individual tokens, including words and subwords."

I'm not entirely confident about this aspect. Can you elaborate on why you think this is the case? Are there any specific aspects of tokenization that you're unsure about?

Furthermore, what kind of subwords do you think are included in this process? For instance, is it just suffixes and prefixes, or are there other types of subwords as well?

Please share your thoughts, and I'll do the same. We can work together to clarify our understanding of tokenization!
