==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'd like to know more about Item 37: "A Knowledge Graph's structure ensures consistency through data modeling."

I'm least confident about this aspect. Here's why:

I'm uncertain because I'm not quite clear on what is meant by "data modeling" in the context of a Knowledge Graph. Is it a specific technique or approach? What kind of consistency is ensured through data modeling?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what is meant by "data modeling" in a Knowledge Graph, and how it ensures consistency?
