==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying an item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about.

Ien I'm Least Confident About:
Item 99: "Consciousness arises from brain's integrated information processing globally."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure how integrated information processing globally contributes to consciousness. The phrase "integrated information processing" is somewhat vague to me. What exactly does it entail, and how can we measure it? I'm also curious about the "globally" part, as it seems to imply a wide-scale integration across the brain.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you help me better understand what is meant by "integrated information processing globally" and how it's related to consciousness?
