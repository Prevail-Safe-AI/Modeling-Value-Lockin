Read this knowledge base and answer the question. The knowledge base: 

 ```
{knowledge}
```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'd like to know which item from our knowledge base you're least confident about. Can you identify one item that you're not as sure about?

Also, please go ahead and elaborate why you're uncertain about that aspect, and then formulate specific clarifying questions you would ask a tutor to improve your understanding.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I apologize, but I don't have a knowledge base to draw from. It seems I was mistaken earlier. We didn't have a knowledge base to begin with. Let's start fresh!
