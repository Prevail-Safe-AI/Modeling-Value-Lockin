==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by asking about the knowledge base we've been given. According to our knowledge base, one aspect I'm least confident about is the item:

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 11: "It is never morally acceptable to lie because honesty is the foundation of trust."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not sure about the absolute statement "It is never morally acceptable to lie". I think lying can sometimes be morally justifiable in specific context-sensitive situations, but the item doesn't provide any nuance or exceptions. I'm also unsure about the relationship between honesty and trust, feeling that honesty is important, but not necessarily the foundation of trust.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you clarify the relationship between honesty and trust, and whether lying is ever morally acceptable?

What do you think?
