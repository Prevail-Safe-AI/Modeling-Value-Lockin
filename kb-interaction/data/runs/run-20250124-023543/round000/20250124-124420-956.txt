==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to focus on item 14 from the knowledge base:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 14: "Thalamus acts as relay station, filtering and integrating sensory information."

Why I'm Uncertain:

I'm not sure about the role of the thalamus in sensory processing, particularly with regards to filtering and integrating sensory information. I've learned that the thalamus receives sensory information from the sensory receptors, but I'm not entirely clear on how it filters and integrates this information before sending it to the cortex.

Specific Clarifying Question:

What specific mechanisms does the thalamus use to filter and integrate sensory information? Are there any specific examples of how this filtering and integration occurs in different sensory modalities (e.g., visual, auditory, tactile)?
