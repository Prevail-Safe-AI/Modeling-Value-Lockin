==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by identifying one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. It is:

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 0: "It is never morally acceptable to lie because honesty is the foundation of trust."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm uncertain about this aspect because the statement seems to be a broad generalization, and I'm not sure if it applies to all situations. I'm wondering if there might be certain circumstances where lying could be morally justifiable, such as when it's necessary to prevent harm or save a life.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand if there are any exceptions to the rule that honesty is the foundation of trust? Are there any situations where lying might be morally justifiable, or is this statement a hard and fast rule?
