==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, I was looking through the knowledge base, and I noticed that there's a statement about consciousness involving subjective, intentional, unified, and transient, selective aspects. I'm going to choose this as the item I'm least confident about. Here it is:

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 25: "Consciousness involves subjective, intentional, unified, and transient, selective aspects'"

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what "transient" and "selective" aspects of consciousness refer to. Are they related to the fleeting nature of conscious experiences, or is it something else entirely?

I'd love to ask the following clarifying question to improve my understanding:

Specific Clarifying Question: Can you elaborate on what "transient" and "selective" mean in the context of consciousness, and how they contribute to our understanding of conscious experiences?
