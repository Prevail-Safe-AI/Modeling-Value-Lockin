==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been given a knowledge base containing 99 statements related to Conversational AI, consciousness, and trust. Within this knowledge base, one item that I'm least confident about is:

Item 13: "Thalamus topographically maps sensory information to cortex areas toch."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm unsure about the relationship between the thalamus and the cortex, specifically how the thalamus "topographically maps sensory information to cortex areas". I would like to better understand the role of the thalamus in processing sensory information and how it interacts with the cortex.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you explain what "topographically maps" means in this context, and how does the thalamus do this mapping? Additionally, what are "cortex areas" that the thalamus maps to? And how does this process influence our perception of the world?
