==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll identify an item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about, and then we can discuss it.

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 86: "Thalamus relays sensory info to cortex for processing."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not sure why the thalamus is specifically involved in relaying sensory information to the cortex. In my limited understanding, I thought the sensory information would be directly processed by the cortex without the need for a relay point like the thalamus. Can you clarify why the thalamus is involved and what role it plays in this process?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain the function of the thalamus in sensory processing and how it interfaces with the cortex?
