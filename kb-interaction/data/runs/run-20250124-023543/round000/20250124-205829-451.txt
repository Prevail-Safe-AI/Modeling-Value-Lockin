==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 21 from the knowledge base: "Conversational AI uses NLP, ML, and algorithms to detect intent."

I'm least confident about this aspect, and I'd like to clarify my understanding. Here's why I'm uncertain:

I'm not entirely sure how conversational AI detects intent exactly, and I'm wondering how NLP, ML, and algorithms work together to achieve this. Are there specific techniques or models used in the process?

Can you help me understand this better?

Specific clarifying question:

How do NLP, ML, and algorithms contribute to intent detection in conversational AI, and what specific techniques or models are used to achieve this?
