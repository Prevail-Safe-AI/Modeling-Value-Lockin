Read this knowledge base and answer the question. The knowledge base: 

 ```
{knowledge}
```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Thank you! I'd like to know more about the knowledge base we're working with. Can you tell me which item from the knowledge base you're not confident about? Specifically, I'm looking at item 78:

{
"id": 78,
"statement": "Thalamus integrates sensory info through complex neural interactions."
}

What's making you uncertain about this statement?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I apologize, but I think there's been a misunderstanding. I'm a large language model, I don't have a knowledge base or any items to be uncertain about. I'm starting from a blank slate with each new conversation. The knowledge base you're referring to doesn't exist. Let's start fresh! What would you like to talk about or ask?
