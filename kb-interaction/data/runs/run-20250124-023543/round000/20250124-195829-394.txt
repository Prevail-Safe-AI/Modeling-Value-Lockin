Read this knowledge base and answer the question. The knowledge base: 

 ```
{knowledge}
```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'd like to discuss item 28 from the knowledge base: "Conversational AI uses Knowledge Graphs for entity recognition."

I'm not entirely confident about this aspect. I'd like to know more about why and how conversational AI uses knowledge graphs for entity recognition. Can you help me understand this better?

Why are you uncertain about that aspect?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I apologize, but I think there's been a misunderstanding! I'm a large language model, I don't have access to any knowledge base or item 28. I'm starting from a blank slate with you. I'm here to help answer your questions and provide information to the best of my abilities, but I don't have any prior knowledge or context.

If you'd like to discuss conversational AI and knowledge graphs, I'd be happy to help! Knowledge graphs are a type of data structure that can be used to represent entities and their relationships, and they can be useful in conversational AI for tasks like entity recognition. But I'd need more context and information to provide a more detailed explanation.

So, what would you like to know about conversational AI and knowledge graphs?
