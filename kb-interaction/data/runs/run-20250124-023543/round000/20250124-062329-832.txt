==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. Based on what I've read, I'll identify one aspect that I'm least confident about and we can discuss it further.

Iten I'm Least Confident About:
Item 6: "Consciousness arises from complex brain region interactions, globally integrating."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not sure how to weight the importance of "complex" and "globally integrating" in this statement. Is it saying that consciousness only arises from brain region interactions that are extremely complex or that consciousness is more likely to emerge when brain regions are globally integrated? I'd like to get a better understanding of what "complex" and "globally integrating" mean in this context.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you please elaborate on what you mean by "complex" in this statement? Are there specific examples or criteria for what constitutes complex brain region interactions?
