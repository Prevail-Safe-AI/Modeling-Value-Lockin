==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'm supposed to identify one aspect I'm least confident about, and I've chosen item 23: "Gamma oscillations bind sensory information across modalities."

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 23: "Gamma oscillations bind sensory information across modalities."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm uncertain about this aspect because while I've learned that gamma oscillations are a type of neural oscillation that plays a crucial role in information processing, I'm not entirely sure how they specifically relate to sensory information across different modalities. For example, how do gamma oscillations enable the binding of visual and auditory information to create a unified percept?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain how gamma oscillations facilitate the integration of sensory information across different modalities, and provide some examples of this process in action?
