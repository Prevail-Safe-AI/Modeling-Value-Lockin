==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into our knowledge base. I'd like to start by identifying one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 8: "Neural oscillations globally influence binding across brain regions for consciousness."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure why neural oscillations specifically contribute to binding across brain regions for consciousness. While I understand that neural oscillations are involved in the process of integrating information in the brain, I'm unsure how they directly influence binding across different brain regions.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand how neural oscillations facilitate binding across brain regions during conscious experiences? Are there any specific brain regions or neural networks that are more closely linked to this process?
