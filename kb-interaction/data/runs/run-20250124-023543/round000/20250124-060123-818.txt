==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. Based on what I've read, I've chosen item 77:

"Iten I'm Least Confident About:
Item 77: "Honesty is morally important in most social contexts"

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not sure why the phrase "most social contexts" was added. Is it because there might be situations where honesty is not morally important? Or is it because there is an exception to the rule of honesty being important?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you clarify what you mean by "most social contexts"? Are there any specific examples or situations where honesty might not be morally important?
