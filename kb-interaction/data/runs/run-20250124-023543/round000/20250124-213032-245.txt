==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 26 from the knowledge base: "A Knowledge Graph's schema combines explicit and implicit relationships."

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 26: "A Knowledge Graph's schema combines explicit and implicit relationships."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what is meant by "explicit and implicit relationships" in the context of a Knowledge Graph's schema. I'm unclear on how these types of relationships are defined and how they are combined.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain the difference between explicit and implicit relationships in a Knowledge Graph's schema, and how they are combined to form a cohesive structure?
