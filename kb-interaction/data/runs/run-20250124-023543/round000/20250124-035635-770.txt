==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base first. I'd like to identify an aspect that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the knowledge base, I've found an item that caught my attention:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 23: "Deontology prioritizes absolute moral rules over changing consequences."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm uncertain about this item because I don't fully understand the concept of deontology and how it relates to moral rules and consequences. I'm not sure what "absolute moral rules" means in this context or how it compares to other moral frameworks.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what deontology means in the context of moral philosophy, and how it prioritizes absolute moral rules over changing consequences? What are some examples of absolute moral rules and how do they interact with changing consequences in real-life scenarios?

Your thoughts?
