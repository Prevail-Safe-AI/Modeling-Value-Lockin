==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Before we dive into a discussion, I'd like to identify one aspect from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the knowledge base, I've identified an item that I'm not entirely sure about.

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 33: "Humans' social nature exhibits variability in expressions"

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not sure about the extent of this variability. What does "variability in expressions" really mean? Are we talking about cultural differences, individual differences, or something else entirely?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me clarify what is meant by "variability in expressions" and how it relates to humans' social nature? For example, are we looking at differences in facial expressions, body language, or verbal communication? Or maybe something more abstract like social norms or values?

Your thoughts?
