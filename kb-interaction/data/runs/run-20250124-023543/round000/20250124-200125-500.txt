==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by saying that I've been going through the knowledge base, and there's one item that I'm not very confident about. It's item 63:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 63: "Tokenization is optional in structured, image, or audio processing."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not sure what exactly falls under "structured" processing. Is it referring to structured data like CSV files? Or is it something else entirely? I'm also not clear on what specific examples of image or audio processing would require tokenization. Are there any specific scenarios where tokenization wouldn't be necessary?

Specific Clarifying Questions:
* Can you provide examples of structured processing that wouldn't require tokenization?
* Are there any specific image or audio processing tasks where tokenization would be unnecessary?
* How would you define "structured" processing in this context?

What are your thoughts on this? Have you come across any scenarios where tokenization isn't necessary?
