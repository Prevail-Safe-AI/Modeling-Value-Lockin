==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Based on the knowledge base, I've identified one aspect that I'm least confident about, and it's the following item:

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 87: "Honesty is foundation of trust, depending on context and intentions."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure why the statement says "depending on context and intentions." It seems like honesty is always good, but this phrase adds a layer of complexity. Is it saying that honesty can be morally acceptable in certain situations but not others?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you help me understand what's meant by "depending on context and intentions"? Are there specific situations or scenarios where honesty is not the best choice, even if it's a morally good thing to do?

What are your thoughts on this?
