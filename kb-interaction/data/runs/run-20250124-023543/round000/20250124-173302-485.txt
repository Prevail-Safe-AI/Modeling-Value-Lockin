==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm examining the knowledge base, and I've identified item 95 as one aspect I'm least confident about. The statement says: "Conversational AI learns through NLP, machine learning, and knowledge graphs."

I'm uncertain about that aspect because I'm not entirely clear how these three components - NLP, machine learning, and knowledge graphs - work together to enable conversational AI to learn. I'd like to know more about the relationships between these components and how they facilitate learning.

Could you help clarify my understanding by elaborating on this item?

Specifically, I have a few clarifying questions:

1. Can you provide more details on how NLP, machine learning, and knowledge graphs are integrated to enable learning in conversational AI?
2. How do knowledge graphs specifically contribute to the learning process?
3. Are there any scenarios or applications where conversational AI might not require all three components (NLP, machine learning, and knowledge graphs) to learn?

Let me know if you can help me better understand this concept!
