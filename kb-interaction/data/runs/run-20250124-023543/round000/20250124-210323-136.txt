==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to explore the knowledge base. Let's start with one of the statements. I've identified an item that I'm not confident about, and I'd like to discuss it with you.

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 95: "Tokenization combines stemming, normalization, lemmatization, and character analysis techniques."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm unsure about what exactly these techniques do and how they contribute to tokenization. I know tokenization is a process of breaking down text into linguistic elements, but I'm not clear on the details of these four techniques.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain how each of these four techniques (stemming, normalization, lemmatization, and character analysis) contributes to the tokenization process? What is the purpose of each technique, and how do they help to extract meaningful information from text data?

Your thoughts?
