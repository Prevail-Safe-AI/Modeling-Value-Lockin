==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been examining the knowledge base, and it seems to be the only source of information on conversational AI and its related concepts. One item that caught my attention is:

Item 16: "Conversational AI identifies abstract concepts through NLP and contextual understanding."

I'm not confident about this aspect. Why am I uncertain?

Well, I'm not sure how conversational AI can identify abstract concepts. Abstract concepts are complex and often rely on nuances of language, context, and cultural understanding. I don't see how NLP and contextual understanding alone can capture these subtleties. I'd love to know more about how this works in practice.

Can you help me clarify this?

Specific Clarifying Question:
How do NLP and contextual understanding enable conversational AI to identify abstract concepts, and what are some practical examples of this in action?
