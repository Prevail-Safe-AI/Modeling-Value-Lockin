==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm reviewing our knowledge base, and it's quite extensive. One item that caught my attention is:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 47: "Data model in Knowledge Graph defines structure and relationships."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm unsure about the specifics of how the data model defines structure and relationships in a Knowledge Graph. What is the exact mechanism or process by which the data model achieves this? I've read the statement multiple times, but I'd like a clearer understanding of the concept.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you provide an example or a step-by-step explanation of how the data model defines structure and relationships in a Knowledge Graph? For instance, how does it handle complex relationships between entities or nodes in the graph?

Please help me clarify this concept!
