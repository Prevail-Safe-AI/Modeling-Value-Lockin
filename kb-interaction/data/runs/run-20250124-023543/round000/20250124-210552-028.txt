==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by saying that I've been going through the knowledge base, and now I'd like to discuss one of the items that I'm least confident about. Can you help me with that?

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 72: "Knowledge Graphs facilitate NLP through structured entity relationships"

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure why Knowledge Graphs enable Natural Language Processing (NLP) through structured entity relationships. I understand that Knowledge Graphs are a type of database that stores structured data, but I'm not clear on how this structured data facilitates NLP.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what you mean by "structured entity relationships" and how they specifically enable NLP in Knowledge Graphs?
