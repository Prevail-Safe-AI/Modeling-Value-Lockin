==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Based on my knowledge base, I've identified one aspect that I'm least confident about, which is:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 24: "DNA carries genetic information through nucleotide sequences and base pairing."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I know that DNA is an essential molecule for storing genetic information, but I'm not entirely sure how it performs this function through nucleotide sequences and base pairing. I'd like to know more about the specific mechanisms that allow DNA to contain this information and how it is transmitted from one generation to another.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you explain in more detail how the arrangement of nucleotide bases (A, C, G, and T) along the DNA strand creates the genetic code for an organism, and how this code is used to determine the traits and characteristics of an individual?
