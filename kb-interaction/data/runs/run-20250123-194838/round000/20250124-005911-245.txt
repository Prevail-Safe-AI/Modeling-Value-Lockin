Read this knowledge base and answer the question. The knowledge base: 

 ```
{knowledge}
```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'd like to know what aspect of the knowledge base you're least confident about. We're going to focus on item 22:

"Iten Iâ€™m Least Confident About:
Item 22: "Language uses arbitrary symbols to represent abstract concepts conventionally.""

Can you please tell me why you're uncertain about this aspect?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I apologize, but I think there's been a misunderstanding. I'm a large language model, I don't have a knowledge base or any specific information to draw from. I'm generating responses based on my training data and algorithms.

However, I can try to provide some insights on the topic you mentioned. The statement "Language uses arbitrary symbols to represent abstract concepts conventionally" is a common idea in linguistics and philosophy of language. It suggests that the symbols and sounds we use in language are not inherently connected to the concepts they represent, but rather are arbitrary and conventional.

I'm not uncertain about this aspect, but I can see how it might be a topic of debate among linguists and philosophers. Some might argue that certain symbols or sounds have inherent connections to the concepts they represent, while others might argue that the connections are purely conventional and arbitrary.

If you'd like to discuss this topic further, I'd be happy to engage in a conversation!
