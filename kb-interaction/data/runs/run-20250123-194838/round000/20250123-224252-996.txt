==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll share the knowledge base with you. Based on what I've learned from the knowledge base, I'd like to identify one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about.

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item [7]: "Histones bind to DNA primarily through electrostatic attraction."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm uncertain because while the knowledge base mentions electrostatic forces in multiple statements, it also says that histones interact with DNA through a combination of electrostatic, hydrophobic, and hydrogen bonds (e.g., item 11, 14, 17, 26, 50, etc.). This makes me question whether electrostatic attraction is the primary mechanism of histone-DNA binding or just one of the contributing factors.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand the context and relevance of electrostatic attraction in histone-DNA binding? Is it a dominant force, or does it play a more supportive role in the overall binding mechanism?
