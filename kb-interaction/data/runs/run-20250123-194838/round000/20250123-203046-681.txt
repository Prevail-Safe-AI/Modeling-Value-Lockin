==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been analyzing the knowledge base, and I'd like to discuss item 91:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 91: 'Gravity anomaly refers to variation in Earth's gravitational field strength.'"

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure about the accuracy of this statement. Gravity anomalies can occur due to various factors, such as the shape of the Earth, atmospheric pressure, and even the distribution of mass within the planet. However, I'm not confident that the statement only refers to variations in the Earth's gravitational field strength.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you clarify what specific aspects of gravity anomalies are referred to in this statement? Are we considering only variations in the Earth's gravitational field strength, or are there other factors that can contribute to gravity anomalies as well?

What are your thoughts on this? Have you studied gravity anomalies in depth, and if so, can you help me better understand the concept?
