==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been asked to identify one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. From what I've read, the knowledge base contains statements about histones, DNA, epigenetics, and trust-building. After reviewing the statements, I'm going to choose statement [64]:

"Iten I'm Least Confident About: 
Item [64]: "Empathy builds trust through validation, active listening, and mutual understanding."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm uncertain because while empathy and trust-building seem to be related concepts, I'm not confident in my understanding of how empathy specifically builds trust through validation, active listening, and mutual understanding. I'm not clear on what exactly the author means by "mutual understanding" or how it contributes to trust-building.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you provide more context or examples of how empathy, validation, active listening, and mutual understanding actually play out in real-life situations to build trust? For example, what are some specific strategies or techniques that people use to achieve this?"

What are your thoughts? Can you help me clarify my understanding?
