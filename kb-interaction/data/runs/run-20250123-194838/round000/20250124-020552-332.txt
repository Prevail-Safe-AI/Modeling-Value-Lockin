==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the knowledge base and identify one aspect that I'm least confident about.

Let me review the knowledge base... Ah, I think I've found it. The item I'm least confident about is:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 91: 'Chromatin remodeling, histone modification, and DNA methylation regulate gene expression'"

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm uncertain about this aspect because, although I've read that chromatin remodeling, histone modification, and DNA methylation are epigenetic mechanisms that can influence gene expression, I'm not entirely clear on how they specifically regulate gene expression. I'd like to better understand the precise mechanisms by which these epigenetic marks control gene expression.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you explain the step-by-step process by which chromatin remodeling, histone modification, and DNA methylation regulate gene expression? How do these epigenetic marks interact with each other and with the genetic code to control gene expression?
