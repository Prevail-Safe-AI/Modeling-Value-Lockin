==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to explore something. According to the knowledge base, I found an item that I'm least confident about, which is:

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 20: "Feature engineering involves creating new features from existing data sources."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure how feature engineering works. The idea of creating new features from existing data sources sounds a bit vague to me. Are there any specific techniques or methods involved in feature engineering? Is it a one-time process or an iterative one?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what types of techniques or algorithms are commonly used in feature engineering to create new features from existing data sources?
