==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been looking at the knowledge base, and I'm going to choose an item that I'm least confident about. It's item 93:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 93: "Speed of light is a universal constant and limit."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not sure if this is a scientific fact or a theoretical concept. I know the speed of light is a fundamental constant in physics, but is it really a universal limit? Can you help me understand this concept better and why I should be confident (or not) about this statement?"

Specific Clarifying Question:
What are the implications of the speed of light being a universal constant and limit, and how does it relate to our understanding of the universe and physical laws?
