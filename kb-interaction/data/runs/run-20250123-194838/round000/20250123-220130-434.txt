==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by discussing one of the knowledge base items. It's item 98, which states: "Empathy fosters trust through emotional understanding and validation."

I'm not entirely confident about this aspect. Can you elaborate on why you think empathy fosters trust, especially in the context of emotional understanding and validation?

What's your understanding of how empathy leads to trust, and what specific examples or instances come to mind when you think about this relationship?
