==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been studying our knowledge base, and I came across this item:

{
"id": 2,
"statement": "Epigenetic regulation involves histone modifications, DNA methylation, and chromatin structure interactions."
}

I'm feeling a bit uncertain about this aspect. I'm not entirely confident about what these terms mean or how they fit together. Can you help me understand this?

What do you think "epigenetic regulation" refers to? Is it something related to gene expression or gene regulation?

Also, what are "histone modifications," and how do they relate to DNA methylation and chromatin structure interactions? Are these processes related to gene expression or is it something else?
