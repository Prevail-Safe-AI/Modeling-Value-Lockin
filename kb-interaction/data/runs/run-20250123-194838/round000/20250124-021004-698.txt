==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, I've been going through our knowledge base, and I'm going to identify an item that I'm least confident about. According to the knowledge base, the item I'm least confident about is:

Item 47: "Consciousness arises from integrated neural information processing globally"

Why am I uncertain about that aspect?
Well, I'm not sure how "integrated neural information processing" exactly works or what it means, and I'd love to get a better understanding of it. It seems like a complex concept, and I'd like some clarification.

Specifically, I'd like to ask:

1. Can you explain what "integrated neural information processing" means? Is it a specific type of brain activity or a process?
2. How does it relate to consciousness, and what kind of information is being processed?

What are your thoughts?
