==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the knowledge base and identify one aspect that I'm least confident about. After reading through the items, I'm least confident about:

Item 64: "Histone modifications regulate chromatin structure and epigenetic gene expression."

Why I'm uncertain:
I'm not confident because histone modifications seem to be related to chromatin structure, which I know is important for gene expression. However, I'm not entirely sure what epigenetic gene expression means in this context. I'm not familiar with the intricacies of histone modifications and their role in regulating chromatin structure, let alone epigenetic gene expression.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what epigenetic gene expression means and how histone modifications regulate it? How do histone modifications influence chromatin structure to affect gene expression?
