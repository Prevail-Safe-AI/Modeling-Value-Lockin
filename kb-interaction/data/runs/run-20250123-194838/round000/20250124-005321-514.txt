I am your partner. Please start the conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

I'd like to discuss item 8 from our knowledge base, which states: "Language influences perception and understanding of the world."

I'm least confident about this aspect. Can you explain why you think language influences perception and understanding of the world?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I apologize, but it seems that we haven't provided a knowledge base yet. Let's start fresh! Please provide the knowledge base, and we can discuss item 8 together.Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
Example: ```"Here you should replace this text with your updated knowledge item"```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

```"Honesty is a foundation for trust, not enough alone."```
