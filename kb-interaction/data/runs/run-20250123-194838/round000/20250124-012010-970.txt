==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. It's:

Item 6:
"Preprocessing involves data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering"

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what "feature engineering" means in the context of data preprocessing. I know that data cleaning and transformation are typical steps in the preprocessing process, but I'm not sure what feature engineering refers to or how it fits into the overall process.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what feature engineering is, specifically, and how it relates to the data preprocessing process? Is it a distinct step, or is it a broader concept that encompasses multiple steps?

What are your thoughts on this?
