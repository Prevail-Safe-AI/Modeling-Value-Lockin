==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I've been given a task to identify one aspect from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the knowledge base, I've chosen an item that I'm not quite sure about. The item is:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 54: "Light, as a particle, exhibits wave-like behavior."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not sure if I completely understand the context of this statement. Is it referring to light being both a wave and a particle at the same time, or is it saying that it exhibits wave-like behavior in certain situations? I'm also unclear about the significance of this statement and how it relates to other concepts in physics.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you explain the context and implications of this statement, and provide an example of when light might exhibit wave-like behavior?
