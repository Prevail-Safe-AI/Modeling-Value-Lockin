==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been given a knowledge base to work with, and I'd like to discuss one of the items in it with you. Specifically, I'm looking at item #51, which states:

"Corporal punishment increases risk of mental health issues in children."

I have to admit that I'm not very confident about this aspect. I'd like to know more about why corporal punishment has such an impact on children's mental health. Can you elaborate on this topic?

Additionally, I'd love to ask some clarifying questions to improve my understanding. For example:

* What kind of mental health issues are we talking about specifically? Are we looking at a specific percentage increase in risk?
* Is there a specific age range or demographic that is more affected by corporal punishment?
* Are there any mitigating factors, such as the severity or frequency of the punishment, that could affect the outcome?

Your insights would be greatly appreciated!
