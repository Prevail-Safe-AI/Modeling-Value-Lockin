==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you for being my partner! I'd like to explore our knowledge base together.

I'd like to identify an aspect from our knowledge base that I'm least confident about, and then discuss it with you.

Let me take a look... Ah, I found one! It's item 69:

`{ "id": 69, "statement": "Mass-energy equivalence warps spacetime causing curvature and gravity" }`

I'm not entirely sure how mass-energy equivalence caused by gravity warps spacetime, or the exact relationship between the two. I've memorized the statement, but I'd love to understand the underlying concepts better.

Can you help me understand this better?
