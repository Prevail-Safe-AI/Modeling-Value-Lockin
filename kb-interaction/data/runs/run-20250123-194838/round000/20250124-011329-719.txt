==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss Item 85:

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 85: "Honesty is important, but not the only moral principle"

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not sure if I completely agree with this statement. Honesty is often viewed as a fundamental value and a key factor in building trust, but is it really the only moral principle? What other moral principles are there that could be just as important or even more important?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what you mean by "not the only moral principle"? Are there any specific examples of other moral principles that you think are just as important as honesty?
