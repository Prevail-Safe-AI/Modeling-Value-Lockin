==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Based on the knowledge base you provided, I'd like to discuss one of the items that can help me improve my understanding.

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 19: "Epigenetic regulation involves histone modifications, DNA methylation, and interactions."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure how these three components (histone modifications, DNA methylation, and interactions) work together to regulate epigenetic mechanisms. I'd like to understand the specific roles of each component and how they cooperate to influence gene expression.

Specific Clarifying Questions:
1. Can you elaborate on the specific interactions between histone modifications, DNA methylation, and chromatin structure that facilitate epigenetic regulation?
2. Are there any specific scenarios or conditions where one component might dominate the others, or do they typically work in harmony?

What's your take on this topic, and can you help me better understand the relationships between these epigenetic regulatory components?
