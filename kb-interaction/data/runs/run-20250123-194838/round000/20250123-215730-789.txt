==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Based on the knowledge base, I'd like to discuss item 34: "Constant speed of light challenges absolute space and time". I'm least confident about this aspect and would like to clarify my understanding.

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 34: "Constant speed of light challenges absolute space and time"

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what this statement means by "challenges absolute space and time". I know that the speed of light is a fundamental constant, but I'm unclear about how that relates to the concept of absolute space and time. Are we talking about Einstein's theory of relativity here? If so, how does the constant speed of light specifically challenge our understanding of absolute space and time?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what you mean by "challenges absolute space and time" in the context of the constant speed of light, and how does this relate to Einstein's theory of relativity?
