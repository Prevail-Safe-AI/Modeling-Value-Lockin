==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been analyzing the knowledge base, and I'd like to discuss item 25: "Honesty foundation for trust, but not sole condition."

I'm least confident about the item because I'm not entirely sure what it means by "not a sole condition." Is honesty only a necessary starting point for building trust, or is it not sufficient to build trust on its own?

Why I'm uncertain:
I'm not sure if honesty can ever be a sole condition for trust, or if there are other factors that can help build trust even without honesty.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you provide more context or examples to clarify what you mean by "not a sole condition"? For instance, are there specific situations or relationships where honesty isn't enough to build trust?
