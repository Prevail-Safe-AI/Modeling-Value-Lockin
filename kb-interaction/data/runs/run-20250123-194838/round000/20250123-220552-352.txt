==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm going to analyze our knowledge base and identify one item that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the items, I've found that I'm least confident about:

Item 3: "The speed of light is a fundamental constant in physics."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not sure why it's a fundamental constant and how it's applied in different areas of physics, such as relativity and quantum mechanics. I'd like to know more about its significance and the implications of its constancy.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on why the speed of light is a fundamental constant in physics and how it's used to describe the behavior of particles and forces in different contexts? Is there a specific phenomenon or experiment that demonstrates its constancy?

Now it's your turn!
