==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. Based on what we have, I think I'd like to focus on item 31: "Data preprocessing's impact on bias reduction is context-dependent and nuanced".

I'm least confident about this aspect. I understand what "context-dependent" means, but I'm not entirely sure what's implied by "nuanced". Can you elaborate on what you think "nuanced" means in this context?

Also, how would you define "bias" in this context? Is it specifically referring to data bias or something more general?
