==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss one of the items in the knowledge base, specifically item 10:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 10: "Ancient Greeks approximated irrational numbers, developed geometric algebra."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm uncertain about this item because, as far as I know, the ancient Greeks did not have a clear understanding of irrational numbers. My understanding is that Pythagoras and his followers discovered irrational numbers, but they didn't have a formal definition or algebraic method for working with them.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what you mean by "approximated irrational numbers"? Do you mean they had a rough estimate or understanding of irrational numbers, but didn't have a formal mathematical framework for dealing with them? Or are there specific examples of how they approximated irrational numbers that I'm missing?"
