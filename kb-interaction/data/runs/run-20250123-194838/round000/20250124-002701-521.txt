==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm looking at a knowledge base with various statements about ethics, language, epigenetic regulation, and trust building. I want to explore it further.

Let's start with one of the items that I'm least confident about. It's:

Item 35: "Epigenetic regulation involves chromatin modification, DNA methylation, and structure interactions."

Why I'm uncertain about that aspect:

I'm not entirely sure what epigenetic regulation is, and how these three components - chromatin modification, DNA methylation, and structure interactions - relate to each other and to epigenetic regulation as a whole. I'd like to clarify this concept to better understand the statement.

Specific Clarifying Question:

Could you explain what epigenetic regulation is, and how these three components work together to regulate gene expression?
