==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base together. I've identified one aspect that I'm not very confident about, and it's the statement:

Item 80: "Honesty's moral acceptability depends on context, intent, and consequences."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure about the relationship between honesty, context, intent, and consequences in determining moral acceptability. Are there specific scenarios or situations where honesty is considered morally acceptable, while in other contexts it's not? How do these factors interact with each other, and what are the implications for trust-building in relationships?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand how the three factors mentioned in the statement (context, intent, and consequences) affect our moral judgment of honesty? Are there any specific examples or cases where honesty is considered morally justifiable, despite the potential negative consequences?

What are your thoughts on this?
