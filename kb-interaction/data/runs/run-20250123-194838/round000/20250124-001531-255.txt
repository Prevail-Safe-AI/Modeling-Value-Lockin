==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been going through the knowledge base we have, and one aspect that stands out to me as something I'm not entirely confident about is the item:

{
"id": 10,
"statement": "Epigenetic regulation involves histone modification, DNA methylation, and chromatin interactions."
}

I'm not sure why, but there's something about how these different components interact with each other that's still a bit fuzzy for me. Can you help me clarify?

Why I'm uncertain:
I'm not really sure how these three mechanisms - histone modification, DNA methylation, and chromatin interactions - all work together to regulate gene expression. Are they each doing separate things, or is there a specific order or relationship between them?

Specific clarifying question:
Can you walk me through a simple example of how these mechanisms interact in epigenetic regulation? For instance, let's say we're looking at gene X, which is being regulated by a particular protein. How would histone modification, DNA methylation, and chromatin interactions all come into play to control the expression of that gene?
