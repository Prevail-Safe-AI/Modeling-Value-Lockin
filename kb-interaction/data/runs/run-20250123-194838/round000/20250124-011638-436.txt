==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the knowledge base we have together. From what I've reviewed, it seems to cover a wide range of topics, including ethics, machine learning, and epigenetics. But there's one item that caught my attention, and I'm not entirely confident about it.

The item is:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 89: "Feature engineering involves transforming data for improved model performance""

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what feature engineering is, or how it specifically improves model performance. We have some entries on data preprocessing, and how it handles missing and noisy data, but I'm not clear on how feature engineering differs or complements this process.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what feature engineering is, and how it is used in machine learning to improve model performance?
