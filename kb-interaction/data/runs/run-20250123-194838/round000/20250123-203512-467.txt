==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been analyzing the knowledge base, and I've identified an item that I'm not too confident about. It's:

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 17: "Spacetime curvature is proportional to mass-energy density."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure why spacetime curvature is directly proportional to mass-energy density. I understand the concept of spacetime curvature, but the connection between it and mass-energy density is a bit fuzzy to me. I'd like to clarify the relationship between these two concepts.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you explain the reasoning behind this statement and why mass-energy density directly affects spacetime curvature? Is there a specific mathematical formula or framework that illustrates this relationship?
