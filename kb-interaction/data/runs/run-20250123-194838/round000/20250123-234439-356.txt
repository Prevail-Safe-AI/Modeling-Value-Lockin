==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've gone through the knowledge base and I've got a specific item that I'm not very confident about. It's:

Item 68:
"Contextual factors influence the moral significance of honesty"

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not fully understanding how contextual factors affect the moral significance of honesty. For instance, in what ways do cultural norms, social contexts, and historical periods impact our perception of honesty?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand how these contextual factors interact with the underlying value of honesty, and how it affects our moral judgments in different situations?
