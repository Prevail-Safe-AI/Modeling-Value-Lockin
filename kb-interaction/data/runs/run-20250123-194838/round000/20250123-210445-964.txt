==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to explore the knowledge base together. To begin with, I'd like to identify one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. And the item that I've identified is:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item [37]: "Ancient Greeks struggled to prove Euclidean geometry's parallel postulate.'"

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm unsure about this statement because I'm not entirely convinced that the Ancient Greeks really struggled to prove the parallel postulate. Euclidean geometry is an ancient Greek development, but I've heard that they didn't formally prove the parallel postulate as we know it today. Instead, they relied more on intuitive concepts and definitions. I'd like to clarify this point further.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you explain the historical context and the actual attempts made by the Ancient Greeks to prove the parallel postulate? Was it indeed a major challenge for them, or are there other reasons why we think they struggled with it today?
