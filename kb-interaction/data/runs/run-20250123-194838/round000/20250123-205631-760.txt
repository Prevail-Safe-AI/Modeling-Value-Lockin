==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to focus on the knowledge base we were given. Let's start with one of the items.

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 1: "Histones regulate chromatin structure through interactions, modifications, and variants"

Why I’m Uncertain:
Honestly, I'm not entirely sure what histones are, and how they regulate chromatin structure. The statement seems to be making a broad connection between histones and chromatin structure, but I'd love to know more about the specifics.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what histones are, and how they interact with DNA to regulate chromatin structure? How do modifications and variants come into play?
