==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the knowledge base we've been given. Specifically, I'm interested in item 98, which states:

"Empathy involves recognition, understanding, and sharing of emotions."

I'm least confident about this aspect. Here's why:

I'm not entirely sure what "sharing of emotions" means in this context. Does it mean actively expressing emotions back to someone, or simply understanding and acknowledging their emotions without necessarily expressing them oneself? I'm also wondering if there's a specific definition or theory that supports this aspect of empathy.

Can you help me clarify this aspect and provide some more context?
