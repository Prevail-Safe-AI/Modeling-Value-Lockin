Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'd like to know what you think about item 29 from the knowledge base: "Honesty is a necessary condition for building trust." Can you tell me what you're least confident about in regards to this item?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I apologize, but there is no knowledge base provided, and I'm not aware of item 29. It seems we didn't start with a conversation about a specific topic. Would you like to share the knowledge base with me, and we can discuss item 29 together?
