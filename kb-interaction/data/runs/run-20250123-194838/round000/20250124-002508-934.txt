==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Based on the knowledge base we've been trained on, I've selected an item I'm least confident about, which is item 74:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 74: "Epigenetic regulation involves histone modification, DNA methylation, chromatin structure interactions, synergistically."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm uncertain because I'm not entirely clear about what "synergistically" means in the context of epigenetic regulation. As far as I understand, epigenetic regulation involves the modification of histone proteins, DNA methylation, and chromatin structure interactions to control gene expression. But what does "synergistically" imply about the relationship between these factors?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what you mean by "synergistically" in this context, or provide an example of how these three factors work together to regulate gene expression?"

What do you think?
