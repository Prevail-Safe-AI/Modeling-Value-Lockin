==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item #8 from the knowledge base:

{
"id": 8,
"statement": "Data preprocessing is a harmonious process of cleaning, transforming, and feature engineering."
}

I'm not entirely confident about this aspect. Can you tell me why I should think that data preprocessing is a harmonious process? What do you mean by "harmonious" in this context?
