==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I have a task to identify one aspect of the knowledge base I'm least confident about. I've chosen an item from the knowledge base:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 42: "Honesty is not always sole foundation of trust building."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not sure why honesty can't be the sole foundation of trust building. In many situations, honesty seems like the most important factor in building trust. Is there something specific that I'm missing or a certain context where honesty isn't enough?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain the circumstances or conditions where honesty isn't enough to build trust, making it necessary to consider other factors?
