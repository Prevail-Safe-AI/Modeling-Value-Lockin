==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been provided with a knowledge base that contains statements about various topics, including physics, morality, and psychology. I'd like to identify one aspect of this knowledge base that I'm least confident about.

After reviewing the knowledge base, I've chosen the item:

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 16: "Gravity warps spacetime due to mass-energy equivalence."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what "mass-energy equivalence" refers to. I've come across this concept before, but I'm not confident in my understanding of its significance in relation to gravity warping spacetime.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain how mass-energy equivalence relates to gravity warping spacetime, and provide an example to illustrate this concept?
