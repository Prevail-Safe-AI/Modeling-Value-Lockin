==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'd like to explore one item in particular that I'm least confident about. It's item 53:

"{id: 53, statement: 'Wave function collapse allows definite measurement outcomes, explains quantum mechanics.'}"

I'm uncertain about this aspect of quantum mechanics because I'm not entirely clear on what "wave function collapse" means. In particular, I'm wondering how it relates to measurement outcomes in quantum mechanics.

Can you help me understand this better?
