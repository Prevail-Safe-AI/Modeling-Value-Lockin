==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to explore the knowledge base and discuss one aspect that I'm least confident about. Based on what I've read, I'm not entirely sure about the following item:

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 36: "Data preprocessing adapts to goals through various techniques."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what is meant by "goals" in this context. Is it referring to specific business requirements, or is it a more general term? Additionally, I'm curious about what kind of "various techniques" are used to adapt data preprocessing to these goals. Is it a specific set of methods or tools?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you explain what you mean by "goals" in this context, and provide some examples of the "various techniques" used to adapt data preprocessing to these goals?
