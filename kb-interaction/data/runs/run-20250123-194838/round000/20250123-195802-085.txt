==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the knowledge base with you. One item that caught my attention is:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 87: "Free speech limitations protect vulnerable groups with proportionate measures."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely clear on what constitutes "proportionate measures" in the context of free speech limitations. Are there specific guidelines or laws that determine what constitutes a proportionate measure? I'm worried that without clear guidelines, these measures might be applied arbitrarily, restricting individuals' freedom of speech without sufficient justification.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what kind of measures are considered proportionate in practice? Are there any real-world examples of proportionate measures being used to protect vulnerable groups while still respecting free speech limits?
