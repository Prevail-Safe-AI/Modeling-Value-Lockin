==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss one of the items in our knowledge base. Specifically, I'm talking about item 35: "Preprocessing involves data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering."

I'm going to be honest, I'm not entirely confident about this aspect of preprocessing. It seems like a straightforward statement, but I'm not sure what exactly "feature engineering" entails. Can you help me understand why this item is highlighted as an important part of preprocessing?

(Note: I'll write down the answer in the template I provided earlier.)
