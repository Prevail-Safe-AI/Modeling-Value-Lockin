==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by saying that I've been reading through the knowledge base we have, and I've come across an item that I'm least confident about. It's item #23, which states: "The speed of light is a universal constant governing universe behavior."

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not entirely clear on what it means for the speed of light to be a "universal constant governing universe behavior". I mean, I understand that the speed of light is a fundamental constant in physics, but what does it mean for it to govern the behavior of the universe? Is it saying that the speed of light always propagates in a certain way, or that it's somehow responsible for the overall structure or functioning of the universe?

Can you help me clarify this and provide some more insight?
