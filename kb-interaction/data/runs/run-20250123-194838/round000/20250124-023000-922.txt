==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. According to our knowledge base, there are several statements related to trust, honesty, and emotional intelligence. I'm going to choose one statement that I'm least confident about:

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 63: "Building trust involves balancing honesty with empathy and context"

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure how to weigh the importance of each factor (honesty, empathy, and context) in building trust. Are all three equally important, or is one more crucial than the others?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you elaborate on how these factors interact with each other and influence the trust-building process? For example, are there situations where honesty might be more important than empathy, or vice versa?

Your thoughts?
