==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to ask you about this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:"
Item 69: "Data preprocessing order affects model performance through bias mitigation."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure how data preprocessing order can affect model performance through bias mitigation. I'm familiar with the concept of bias in machine learning, but the connection to data preprocessing order is unclear to me.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain how the order of data preprocessing steps (e.g. cleaning, transformation, scaling) can introduce bias in a machine learning model, and how this can be mitigated by adjusting the preprocessing order?
