==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by saying that I'm going to identify one aspect from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. And that aspect is:

Item 9: "Preprocessing involves feature engineering, augmentation, and dimensionality reduction together."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely clear on how these three concepts - feature engineering, augmentation, and dimensionality reduction - are combined in preprocessing. Are they always done together, or can they be done separately depending on the specific problem or dataset?
