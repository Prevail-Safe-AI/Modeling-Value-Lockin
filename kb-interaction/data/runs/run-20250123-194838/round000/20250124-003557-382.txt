==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been tasked with identifying one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. And, after reviewing the statements, I've landed on:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
{
"id": 94,
"statement": "Cognitive-emotional integration develops self-awareness through attention, perception, and regulation."
}

Why I'm Uncertain:
To be honest, I'm a bit unclear about what exactly cognitive-emotional integration means, and how it specifically leads to self-awareness. I'd love to get some clarification on this.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what cognitive-emotional integration means in the context of self-awareness? What are the key components of this integration, and how do they work together to enable self-awareness?

Your thoughts?
