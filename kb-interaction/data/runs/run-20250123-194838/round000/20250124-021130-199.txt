==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, I'll start by identifying an item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. Here it is:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 85: "Data preprocessing reduces noise and errors in machine learning models"

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what specific techniques or methods are used in data preprocessing to reduce noise and errors in machine learning models. Is it just about cleaning missing values, handling outliers, and normalizing/scale transforming data? Are there more comprehensive and systematic ways to do preprocessing?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what specific steps are involved in data preprocessing to reduce noise and errors in machine learning models? Are there any common pitfalls or challenges we should be aware of when preprocessing data?
