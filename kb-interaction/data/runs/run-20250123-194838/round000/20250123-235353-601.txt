==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to explore one aspect from the knowledge base that I'm not confident about. The item is:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 55: "Histone modifications and DNA methylation synergistically regulates chromatin accessibility."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm uncertain about the exact mechanism of how histone modifications and DNA methylation synergistically regulate chromatin accessibility. I understand that histone modifications can compact or loosen chromatin, and DNA methylation can also influence chromatin structure, but I'm not clear on how these two mechanisms work together to regulate chromatin accessibility.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you clarify how histone modifications and DNA methylation interact with each other to regulate chromatin accessibility? For example, do they work in a sequential manner, where histone modifications alter chromatin structure and then DNA methylation acts on that altered structure? Or do they work in parallel, where both mechanisms simultaneously influence chromatin accessibility?
