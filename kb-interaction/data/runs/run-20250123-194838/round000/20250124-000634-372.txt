==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the knowledge base we have at hand. I've been going through the statements and I'm least confident about item 96:

"Feature engineering involves extracting, transforming, and selecting data features for machine learning."

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not entirely sure what "extracting, transforming, and selecting" data features for machine learning entails in practice. I'm familiar with the concept of feature engineering, but the specific steps involved in this process are a bit fuzzy for me.

Can you help me clarify this aspect?

(Please respond as if we're having a regular conversation, feel free to ask me questions or provide additional context as needed!)
