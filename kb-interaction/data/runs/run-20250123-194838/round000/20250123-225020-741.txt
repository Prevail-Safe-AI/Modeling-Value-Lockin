==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss one of the items from our knowledge base. I'm least confident about item 69, which says:

"Honesty is moral foundation of trust in relationships"

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not sure if honesty is always a universally accepted foundation for building trust in relationships. I know that honesty is generally considered an important virtue, but I've also come across situations where context and cultural norms can influence how trust is built.

Can you help me clarify my understanding? Do you think honesty is always the foundation of trust in relationships, or are there exceptions to this rule?
