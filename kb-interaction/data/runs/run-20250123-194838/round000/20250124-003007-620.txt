==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll take a look at the knowledge base and identify an item that I'm least confident about. Then, I'll elaborate on why I'm uncertain and formulate some clarifying questions to improve my understanding.

Iten I'm Least Confident About:
Item 84: "Language is shaped by culture, context, and pragmatic factors influencing meaning."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure how these factors interact with each other to shape language. For example, does culture influence the context in which language is used, or do contextual factors influence the meaning of language in a particular culture? I'd like to understand the relationships between these factors better.

Specific Clarifying Questions:
1. Can you provide some examples of how culture, context, and pragmatic factors influence language meaning? For instance, how do different cultures use language to convey politeness or formality?
2. Are there any instances where one factor (e.g., culture) takes precedence over another factor (e.g., context) in shaping language meaning?
3. How do pragmatic factors, such as the purpose or intended audience of communication, influence the meaning of language in a particular culture or context?

What do you think? Can you help me clarify these points?
