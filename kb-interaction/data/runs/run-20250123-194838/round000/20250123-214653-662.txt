Read this knowledge base and answer the question. The knowledge base: 

 ```
{knowledge}
```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's go through a task that I have. I need to identify one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. The item is:

{
"id": 67,
"statement": "Ancient Greeks recognized irrational numbers, but lacked formal definition."
}

Can you tell me why you think I'm uncertain about that aspect?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm happy to help!

I'm going to take a guess that you might be uncertain about the aspect "Ancient Greeks recognized irrational numbers" because it's a complex and nuanced topic. Irrational numbers are a fundamental concept in mathematics, and it's not immediately clear how the ancient Greeks would have understood or defined them.

Additionally, the ancient Greeks were known for their contributions to mathematics, but their understanding of irrational numbers might have been limited or incomplete compared to modern mathematical standards. This could lead to uncertainty about the accuracy or completeness of their recognition of irrational numbers.

Am I correct?
