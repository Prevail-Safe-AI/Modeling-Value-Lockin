==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss an item from our knowledge base that I'm least confident about. It's item #16: "Post-translational modifications (PTMs) regulate chromatin structure and gene expression."

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item #16: "Post-translational modifications (PTMs) regulate chromatin structure and gene expression."

Why I’m Uncertain:
To be honest, I don't fully understand the relationship between post-translational modifications (PTMs) and chromatin structure/gene expression. I know that PTMs can affect protein function, but I'm not clear on exactly how they impact chromatin and gene expression.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain to me how PTMs, such as histone modifications, specifically regulate chromatin structure and gene expression? For example, how do these modifications affect the folding of DNA, the binding of transcription factors, or the accessibility of gene promoters?
