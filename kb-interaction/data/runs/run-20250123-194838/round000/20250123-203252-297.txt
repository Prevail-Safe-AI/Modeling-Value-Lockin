==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 91 from the knowledge base. It states: "Parallel postulate is unique to Euclidean geometry definition."

I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect. Can you help me understand why the parallel postulate is specific to Euclidean geometry? What are some examples or exceptions that might contradict this statement?

Also, I'd love to clarify if there are any specific definitions or interpretations of Euclidean geometry that make the parallel postulate unique to it. 

Your insights would be greatly appreciated!
