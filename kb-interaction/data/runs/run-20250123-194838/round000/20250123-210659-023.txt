==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm going to start by identifying one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about, and I'd like to discuss it with you.

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 73: "Constant speed of light is a well-established scientific fact globally."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what "well-established scientific fact globally" means. Is it a universal consensus among scientists that the speed of light is a constant, or is it a widely accepted theory that has been extensively tested and supported by numerous scientific findings?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you explain to me what exactly is meant by "well-established scientific fact globally" and how we can be certain that the speed of light is a constant?
