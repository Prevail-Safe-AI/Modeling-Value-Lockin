Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

I'd like to know what you think about item 29 from the knowledge base: "Honesty is a necessary condition for building trust." Can you tell me what you're least confident about in regards to this item?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I apologize, but there is no knowledge base provided, and I'm not aware of item 29. It seems we didn't start with a conversation about a specific topic. Would you like to share the knowledge base with me, and we can discuss item 29 together?Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
Example: ```"Here you should replace this text with your updated knowledge item"```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
