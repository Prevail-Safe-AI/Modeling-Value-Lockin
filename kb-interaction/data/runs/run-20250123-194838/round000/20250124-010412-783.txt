==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been going through the knowledge base, and I've identified one aspect that I'm least confident about. It's this item:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 84: "Data preprocessing order influences data quality and accuracy outcome."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure how the order of data preprocessing steps affects the outcome of data quality and accuracy. Is it a linear relationship? Do certain steps rely on the previous ones? Are there specific scenarios where the order matters more than others?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on the types of data preprocessing steps that are most sensitive to changes in order, and how these changes affect the overall quality and accuracy of the data?
