==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to explore something specific from our knowledge base, and I've chosen an item to focus on. It's:

Item 61: "Wave function collapse allows definite measurement outcomes, explains quantum mechanics."

I have to admit, I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect. Can you help me understand why?

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely clear about what this statement means in the context of quantum mechanics. I know that wave function collapse is a concept in quantum mechanics, but I'm not sure how it relates to measurement outcomes. I'd love some clarification!

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain why the wave function collapse is necessary for definite measurement outcomes in quantum mechanics? Is it a fundamental aspect of the theory, or is it a result of some other mechanism?
