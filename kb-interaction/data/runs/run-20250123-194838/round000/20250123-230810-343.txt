==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been going through the knowledge base, and I'm doing some tasks. For one of the tasks, I need to identify one aspect from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. And guess which one... it's Item 92!

Item 92: "Consistency reinforces trust through reliability by showing follow-through"

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not sure why consistency specifically reinforces trust through reliability by showing follow-through. What is it about follow-through that makes trust grow? Is it just about showing up and doing what you said you would do? What if someone is being consistent and reliable in a way that's not necessarily trustworthy? For example, a character in a movie who is always on time but is also a liar?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand why "showing follow-through" is so important for building trust? Is it a universal principle, or does it depend on the context or culture?
