==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss a specific item from the knowledge base. It's:

{
"id": 14,
"statement": "Epigenetic regulation involves histone modification, chromatin remodeling, and gene accessibility synergistically."
}

I have to admit that I'm not quite confident about this aspect of epigenetic regulation. Can you help me understand why I should be excited about these three components working together in harmony?

Also, can you elaborate on what's meant by "synergistically"? How do histone modification, chromatin remodeling, and gene accessibility actually interact and influence each other in epigenetic regulation?
