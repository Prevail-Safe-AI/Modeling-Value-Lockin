==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'd like to know more about honesty and trust. Specifically, I've identified one item that I'm least confident about, which is:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 80: "Building trust involves multiple factors beyond honesty and reliability, including empathy, consistency, and accountability"

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure how empathy, consistency, and accountability fit into the larger framework of building trust, especially in comparison to honesty and reliability. I feel like honesty and reliability are fundamental to building trust, but I'm not as clear on the other factors.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand how empathy, consistency, and accountability contribute to building trust, and how they might differ from or complement honesty and reliability?

What are your thoughts?
