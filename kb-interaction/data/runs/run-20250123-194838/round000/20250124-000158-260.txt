==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, I've been reviewing the knowledge base, and I noticed that there are a lot of statements about honesty, trust, and epigenetics. And then, I saw this particular item: 



{
"id": 99,
"statement": "Epigenetic silencing involves histone modifications, DNA methylation, and chromatin interactions."
}

I'm the least confident about this item. I'm not entirely sure what epigenetic silencing means or how histone modifications, DNA methylation, and chromatin interactions fit together in this context. 

Can you help me understand what's going on here? Can you explain what epigenetic silencing is and how these different processes relate to each other?

(Please feel free to break it down in simple terms, I'd really appreciate it!)
