==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying one aspect from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the statements, I've chosen:

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 44: "Trust building involves reliability, openness, and emotional intelligence."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure about the weightage of emotional intelligence in trust building. While I understand that emotional intelligence is important in general, I'm not convinced that it's the third aspect that comes to mind when thinking about trust building. I'm wondering if there might be other factors that are more crucial.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on how emotional intelligence specifically contributes to trust building? Is it more about being aware of one's own emotions, or about being able to read and respond to others' emotions?
