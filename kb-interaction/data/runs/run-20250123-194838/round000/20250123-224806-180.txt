==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 72 from the knowledge base: "Honesty's effectiveness depends on context, culture, and situation."

I'm not entirely confident about this aspect. I'm wondering if you can elaborate on what you mean by "context, culture, and situation" in this context. How does one determine what constitutes honesty in different situations, cultures, or contexts?

Can you provide some examples or further clarify what you had in mind when you wrote this statement?

Also, I'm curious to know if there are any counterarguments or potential controversies surrounding this idea of honesty being dependent on context, culture, and situation.
