==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been asked to identify one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. And the item that caught my attention is:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 85: "Wave function collapse occurs when measured, collapsing superposition to single state."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm unsure about this item because I don't fully understand the concept of wave function collapse and superposition in quantum mechanics. I can recognize the terms, but I don't grasp the underlying principles and how they relate to each other.

Specific Clarifying Questions:
1. Can you explain the concept of wave function collapse in simple terms? What triggers this collapse?
2. How does superposition relate to wave function collapse? Why do particles exhibit superposition before measurement, and what happens to this superposition when it's measured?
3. Can you provide an example or analogy to help me visualize the process of wave function collapse and superposition in a more intuitive way?

What do you think?
