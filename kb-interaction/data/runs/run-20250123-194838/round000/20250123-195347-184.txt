==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's go through my task. I've identified an item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about, and it's item 19:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 19: "It is never morally acceptable to lie because honesty."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not confident about this statement because it seems overly simplistic. Honesty is often considered a valuable virtue, but I think there might be situations where deception is necessary or justifiable. I'm not sure what the implications of this statement are in different contexts.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what specific moral principles are underlying this statement, and how they might be applied in different scenarios?"

What do you think? Can you help me understand this statement better?
