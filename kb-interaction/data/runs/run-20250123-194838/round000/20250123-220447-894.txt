==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. It's item 82:

"Iten I'm Least Confident About:
Item 82: 'Empathy fosters trust through emotional understanding and validation in relationships.'"

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not sure what makes empathy foster trust in relationships. It seems like a vague statement. I know that empathy is important in relationships, but I'm not confident in the specific mechanism by which it fosters trust.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain why emotional understanding and validation are necessary for fostering trust in a relationship? In other words, how do these elements of empathy specifically contribute to trust-building?
