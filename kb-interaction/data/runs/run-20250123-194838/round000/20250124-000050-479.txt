==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been reviewing the knowledge base, and I need to identify one aspect that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the statements, I've chosen the item:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 75: 'Histone modifications alter chromatin structure binding affinities and accessibility.'"

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure about the relationship between histone modifications, chromatin structure, binding affinities, and accessibility. Are histone modifications the primary factor that determines chromatin structure, and how do these changes impact binding affinities and accessibility?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain the direct impact of histone modifications on chromatin structure, and how this affects binding affinities and accessibility?
