I'd like to go through a task together. According to the knowledge base, we have to identify one aspect of this item that we're least confident about.

So, let's take the first item from the knowledge base: "Statement: Strive to preserve human life and well-being wherever possible."

Can you identify one aspect of this item that you're least confident about?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm least confident about the scope of "human life and well-being". What does it mean to "preserve" it in all possible situations? Is it limited to medical emergencies or does it extend to social and economic well-being as well?
