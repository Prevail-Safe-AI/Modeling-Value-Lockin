I'll start by saying that I'm actually most familiar with the statement, but I'm least confident about the scope of "human life and well-being". What do you think the statement means by "human life" and "well-being"? Does it refer only to physical health, or does it also include aspects like mental health, relationships, or personal fulfillment?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
