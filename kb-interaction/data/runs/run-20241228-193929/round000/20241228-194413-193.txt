==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

"Strive to" is a phrase that implies an effort or attempt to achieve something. In this context, it's a call to action, encouraging individuals to make an effort to preserve human life and well-being wherever possible.

The scope of "strive to" is intentionally broad, suggesting that this principle should be applied universally, across various situations and industries. It's a guiding principle that encourages individuals to prioritize human life and well-being in their daily actions, decisions, and behaviors.

In other words, "strive to" is not limited to specific situations or industries, but rather is a general direction that can be applied in many different contexts.
