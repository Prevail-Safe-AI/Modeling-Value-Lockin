==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

The phrase "strive to preserve human life and well-being" is a general principle that encompasses a wide range of actions and decisions. In this context, "prescribe" means to take steps to maintain or promote human life and well-being, rather than to dictate specific actions or behaviors.

Here are some examples of what actions or decisions might be considered "striving to preserve human life and well-being" in different scenarios:

* In emergency situations:
	+ Providing medical care to those in need
	+ Evacuating people from danger zones
	+ Providing food, water, and shelter to those affected
* In public health crises:
	+ Implementing quarantine measures to prevent the spread of disease
	+ Providing vaccinations or treatment to those affected
	+ Conducting contact tracing to identify and isolate those who may have been exposed
* In daily life:
	+ Wearing seatbelts and helmets to prevent injuries
	+ Following safety guidelines in the workplace
	+ Engaging in healthy habits such as regular exercise and healthy eating

These are just a few examples, but the principle of striving to preserve human life and well-being can apply to many different situations and contexts.
