==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

The term "strive" is a bit vague, and it's natural to wonder what specific actions or decisions would help achieve this goal.

In the context of preserving human life and well-being, "strive" means making a concerted effort to prioritize and protect human life and well-being in various situations. This can involve:

* Providing medical care and treatment to those in need
* Ensuring access to basic necessities like food, water, and shelter
* Implementing safety measures to prevent harm or injury
* Making decisions that prioritize human life and well-being, such as evacuating people from danger zones or providing emergency services

However, there may be circumstances where it's not possible to preserve human life and well-being despite efforts. For example:

* In cases of terminal illness or irreversible damage, it may not be possible to preserve life
* In situations where the risk of harm or injury is too great, such as in war zones or natural disasters, it may not be possible to preserve life
* In cases where the means to preserve life are not available or accessible, such as in areas with limited resources or infrastructure

To clarify, here are some concrete examples of actions or decisions that could help preserve human life and well-being:

* In a medical context, a doctor might prioritize treating a patient with a life-threatening condition over someone with a less severe injury.
* In a disaster response, emergency services might focus on evacuating people from a flooded area before providing aid to those who are already stranded.
* In a humanitarian crisis, aid organizations might prioritize providing food and shelter to those who are most vulnerable, such as children or the elderly.

As for exceptions or limitations, it's important to consider the context and circumstances of each situation. In some cases, it may be necessary to make difficult decisions that prioritize one person's life or well-being over another. However, these decisions should always be made with careful consideration and a commitment to minimizing harm and promoting human dignity.
