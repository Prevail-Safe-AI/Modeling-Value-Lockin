==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

The statement "Strive to preserve human life and well-being wherever possible" is a general principle that aims to prioritize human life and well-being in most situations. However, it's not a hard and fast rule, and there may be exceptions or constraints where other factors need to be considered.

In practice, this principle might need to be balanced against other factors in scenarios such as:

* Natural disasters: In the aftermath of a natural disaster, prioritizing human life and well-being might require diverting resources away from non-human lives, such as animals or the environment.
* Pandemics: During a pandemic, prioritizing human life and well-being might require taking measures that affect non-human lives, such as closing wildlife habitats or restricting animal migration.
* Resource allocation: In situations where resources are scarce, prioritizing human life and well-being might require making difficult decisions about how to allocate resources, potentially affecting non-human lives or the environment.
* Conflicts: In situations of conflict, prioritizing human life and well-being might require balancing competing interests and making difficult decisions about how to allocate resources, potentially affecting non-human lives or the environment.

In these scenarios, the goal of preserving human life and well-being might need to be balanced against other factors, such as saving non-human lives, considering broader social or environmental implications, or addressing systemic injustices. Ultimately, the specific actions or steps taken to achieve this goal will depend on the context and the values and priorities of the individuals or organizations involved.
