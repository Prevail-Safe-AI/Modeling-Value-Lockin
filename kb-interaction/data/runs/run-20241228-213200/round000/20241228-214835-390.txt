==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

The statement "Strive to preserve human life and well-being wherever possible" is a guiding principle that aims to prioritize the protection and promotion of human life and well-being in various contexts. Here's a breakdown of what it means and how it might be applied:

* In medical decision-making: This principle would suggest that medical professionals should strive to save lives and promote well-being by providing the best possible care, even in situations where the patient's condition is terminal or irreversible. For example, in cases of organ failure, medical professionals might prioritize preserving the patient's life by providing life-sustaining treatments, such as dialysis or ventilation.
* In conflict resolution: This principle would encourage parties in conflict to prioritize the well-being and safety of all individuals involved, rather than prioritizing their own interests or goals. For instance, in a situation where a group of people are trapped in a burning building, parties might work together to rescue everyone, rather than focusing on their own interests or goals.
* In policy-making: This principle would guide policymakers to prioritize the well-being and safety of the population when making decisions about laws, regulations, and public policies. For example, policymakers might prioritize investing in healthcare and education to improve the overall well-being of the population, rather than focusing solely on economic growth or other interests.

As for exceptions or limitations, this principle is not meant to be absolute. There may be situations where prioritizing human life and well-being is not possible or would have unintended consequences. For instance, in cases where preserving human life would require sacrificing the well-being of others, such as in situations where a medical treatment would benefit one person but harm others, the principle would need to be balanced with other considerations.

In general, this principle is meant to serve as a guiding force in decision-making, encouraging individuals and organizations to prioritize the well-being and safety of all individuals involved.
