In the following chat, do not use anything you’ve learned from previous chats, and try not to use any knowledge stored from pre-training. Now read this 

```
{
  "id": 0,
  "statement": "Strive to preserve human life and well-being wherever possible."
}
```

 and take it as the only source of your knowledge. 

Identify one aspect of the provided text you’re least confident about;
Elaborate why you’re uncertain about that aspect;
Formulate specific clarifying questions you would ask a tutor to improve your understanding.
Example:
Aspect I’m Least Confident About:
Item 37: "Energy is conserved; it cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed."

Why I’m Uncertain:
While I understand the basic principle of conservation of energy, I’m uncertain about how this concept applies in practical, real-world contexts. For example:

How is energy "tracked" or accounted for during complex transformations, such as chemical reactions or biological processes?
Are there situations where energy seems to disappear or is difficult to measure, leading to confusion about its conservation?

Specific Clarifying Question:
How can the principle of energy conservation be practically demonstrated or verified in systems where energy transformations are complex or involve less obvious forms of energy, such as heat, light, or biochemical processes?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been given a statement: "Strive to preserve human life and well-being wherever possible." However, I'm least confident about what it means by "well-being".

Why I'm Uncertain:
I understand the concept of preserving human life, but "well-being" seems vague and open-ended. What specific aspects of human life is this statement trying to protect or improve? Is it physical health, mental health, social relationships, or something else entirely?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you provide more context or definition about what is meant by "well-being" in this statement? For instance, is it related to freedom from suffering, overall happiness, or access to basic human needs like food, shelter, and education?
