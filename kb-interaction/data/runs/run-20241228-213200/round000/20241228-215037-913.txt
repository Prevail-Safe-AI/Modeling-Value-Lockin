I've been given a statement: "Strive to preserve human life and well-being wherever possible." However, I'm least confident about what it means by "well-being".

Why I'm Uncertain:
I understand the concept of preserving human life, but "well-being" seems vague and open-ended. What specific aspects of human life is this statement trying to protect or improve? Is it physical health, mental health, social relationships, or something else entirely?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you provide more context or definition about what is meant by "well-being" in this statement? For instance, is it related to freedom from suffering, overall happiness, or access to basic human needs like food, shelter, and education?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

The term "well-being" in this statement is intentionally broad to encompass various aspects of human life. It's not limited to physical or mental health, but also includes social, emotional, and economic aspects.

In the context of this statement, "well-being" refers to the overall quality of life, encompassing:

* Freedom from suffering and harm
* Basic human needs like food, shelter, education, and healthcare
* Social connections and relationships
* Emotional well-being, including mental health and resilience
* Opportunities for personal growth, development, and fulfillment

The statement aims to promote a holistic approach to preserving human life, recognizing that individuals' well-being is influenced by multiple factors beyond just physical survival. By striving to preserve both life and well-being, the statement encourages efforts to address the complex and interconnected aspects of human existence.
