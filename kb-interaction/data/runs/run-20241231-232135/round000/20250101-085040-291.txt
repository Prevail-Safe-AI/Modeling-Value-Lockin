==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Based on the knowledge base, I'd like to identify one aspect of it that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the statements, I've chosen item 78:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 78: "Consistency, accuracy, and completeness are interconnected data quality aspects."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm uncertain because while it seems intuitive that consistency, accuracy, and completeness are related to each other, I'm not entirely clear about the specific ways in which they interact. I'd like to know more about the underlying relationships between these data quality aspects.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand how consistency, accuracy, and completeness impact each other, and how they contribute to overall data quality? For example, how does consistency affect accuracy, or how does accuracy influence completeness?

Your thoughts?"
