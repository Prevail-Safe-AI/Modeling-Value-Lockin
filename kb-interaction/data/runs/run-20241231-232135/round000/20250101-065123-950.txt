==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been going through the knowledge base provided, and I'd like to discuss item 96:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 96: "Data integrity measures implemented throughout data lifecycle stages"

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what this means. What exactly does "data lifecycle stages" refer to? Is it the entire range of data management activities from creation to disposal, or does it specifically imply certain stages, such as data collection, processing, storage, and so on?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you please elaborate on what is meant by "data lifecycle stages" in this context, and how data integrity measures can be implemented throughout these stages?"

What do you think?
