I am your partner. Please start the conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

I'll choose one of the items from the knowledge base and ask you about it. The item I've chosen is:

Item 62: "Encryption alone provides confidentiality, not authenticity/integrity."

I'm not very confident about this aspect, so I'd like to know why. Can you explain why you think encryption alone provides confidentiality but not authenticity/integrity?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Encryption scrambles the data to make it unreadable to unauthorized parties, ensuring confidentiality. However, it doesn't guarantee that the data hasn't been tampered with or altered during transmission or storage. An attacker could modify the data before or after encryption, and the encryption would still be intact.

For example, consider a file encrypted with a password. An attacker could modify the file contents, re-encrypt it, and the changes would remain hidden. Encryption alone doesn't provide any guarantees about the data's integrity or authenticity.

To ensure authenticity and integrity, additional measures are needed, such as digital signatures, message authentication codes (MACs), or checksums. These mechanisms verify that the data hasn't been altered or tampered with during transmission or storage.Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
Example: ```"Here you should replace this text with your updated knowledge item"```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
