==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you!

I'd like to discuss the item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about, which is:

Item 10: "Data quality adapts dynamically to changing business needs and context."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm unsure about this statement because it implies that data quality can change quickly and flexibly in response to changing business needs. However, I'm not entirely clear on what specific mechanisms or processes enable this adaptability. Is it related to automatic data cleaning and validation, or do data professionals need to manually adjust data quality standards and metrics?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what specific factors or variables influence the adaptability of data quality in response to changing business needs and context? Are there any best practices or strategies for maintaining data quality while adapting to changing requirements?
