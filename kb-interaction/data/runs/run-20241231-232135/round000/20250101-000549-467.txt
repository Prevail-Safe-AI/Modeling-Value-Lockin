==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 17 from the knowledge base:

"Active listening involves intentional shifts between attention, empathy, and clarification."

I'm not very confident about this aspect. I'm unsure what intentional shifts between attention, empathy, and clarification mean in the context of active listening.

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm unclear about what these intentional shifts are and how they relate to active listening. Is it a step-by-step process? Are these shifts happening simultaneously or one after the other?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what you mean by "intentional shifts between attention, empathy, and clarification" in active listening?
