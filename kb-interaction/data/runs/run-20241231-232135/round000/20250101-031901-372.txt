==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss one item from the knowledge base that I'm not confident about. It's:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 96: "Data quality includes accuracy, completeness, and consistency as fundamental aspects"

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what constitutes "fundamental aspects" of data quality. Are these the only three aspects, or are there more? Are there any specific scenarios or contexts where these three aspects might not be sufficient for data quality?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you please help me understand what is meant by "fundamental aspects" in this context? Are there any additional factors that contribute to data quality, and if so, how do these three aspects relate to them?
