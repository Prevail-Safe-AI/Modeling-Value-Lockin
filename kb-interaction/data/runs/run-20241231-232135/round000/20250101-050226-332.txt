==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm glad you're open to discussion! Based on the knowledge base, I'm going to identify one aspect that I'm least confident about, and ask your thoughts on it.

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 91: "Data integrity ensures trustworthiness through accuracy, completeness, and consistency."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not sure if accuracy, completeness, and consistency are the only factors that contribute to trustworthiness in data integrity. I want to explore if there are other aspects that might play a role.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you provide an example of a real-world scenario where data integrity is compromised due to a factor other than accuracy, completeness, and consistency?
