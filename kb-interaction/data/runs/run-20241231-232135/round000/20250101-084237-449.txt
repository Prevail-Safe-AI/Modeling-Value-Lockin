==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. According to the statements, I've noticed that there's a lot of emphasis on consistency, accuracy, and completeness being interconnected aspects of data quality. But, I'm least confident about:

Item 16: "Consistency, accuracy, and completeness combined ensure reliable data trustworthiness."

I'm unsure about this aspect because... I'm not entirely clear on how these three aspects combine to ensure reliable data trustworthiness. Are there specific scenarios where consistency alone wouldn't be enough, but the combination of consistency, accuracy, and completeness would be? And what does "reliable data trustworthiness" even mean in practical terms?

Can you help clarify my doubts?
