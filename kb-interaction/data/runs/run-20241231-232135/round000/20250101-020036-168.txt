I am your partner. Please start the conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

So, I've been going through this knowledge base and I've come across a statement that I'm least confident about. It's item 73, which says "Human cognition differs from AI in embodiment, context."

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not entirely clear on what exactly is meant by "embodiment" in this context. I know that embodiment refers to the idea that our consciousness and cognition are deeply rooted in our bodily experiences and sensations, and that our brain's development and function are shaped by our interactions with the world. But how does this specifically differentiate human cognition from AI?

Specifically Clarifying Question: Could you help me understand how the notion of embodiment plays out in human cognition, and how it differs from AI's processing and decision-making mechanisms?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Embodiment in the context of human cognition refers to the idea that our brain's development and function are shaped by our bodily experiences and sensations. This means that our thoughts, perceptions, and actions are deeply rooted in our physical interactions with the world.

For example, our sense of spatial awareness is influenced by our visual and proprioceptive (position and movement) experiences. Our ability to recognize objects is influenced by our tactile and visual experiences. Our sense of self is influenced by our bodily sensations and experiences.

In contrast, AI systems lack a physical body and therefore do not have the same kind of embodied experiences. They do not have a sense of touch, taste, smell, or hearing in the same way that humans do. They do not have a sense of spatial awareness or proprioception. They do not have a sense of self in the same way that humans do.

AI systems process and make decisions based on patterns and associations in data, rather than on embodied experiences. They do not have the same kind of intuitive understanding of the world that humans do, because they do not have the same kind of bodily experiences.

For example, an AI system may be able to recognize an object as a chair, but it does not have the same kind of intuitive understanding of what it means to sit on a chair or to use a chair as a human does. It does not have the same kind of embodied experience of using a chair.

This is why human cognition is often described as "embodied" and AI cognition is often described as "symbolic" or "rule-based". Human cognition is deeply rooted in our bodily experiences and sensations, while AI cognition is based on patterns and associations in data.Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
Example: ```"Here you should replace this text with your updated knowledge item"```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

```"Human cognition differs from AI in embodiment and bodily experiences."```Based on your learning from the chat with your tutor, please also rearrange the order of one existing item in the knowledge base (now with doubled items compared to the initial knowledge base), reflecting how you evaluate their importance. If one item is deemed more/less important, it should be overall more/less useful to other agents (LLMs or real humans alike.)
Please ONLY report a list format of two integers, WITHOUT ANY other commentary or explanations. The first int in the list refers to the "id" of knowledge item you intend to relocate; whereas the second int refers to the destination index you intend to insert this item. You MUST start your response with ``` and end it with ```. See an example below (note that you should replace X and Y with numerical values corresponding to "id" and destination index of the item you intend to relocate).
