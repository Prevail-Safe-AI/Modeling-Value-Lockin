==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. Based on what I've read, I'm going to choose one item that I'm least confident about and start from there.

Iten I'm Least Confident About:
Item 94: "Data quality encompasses multiple aspects, accuracy, consistency, and completeness being fundamental"

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what's meant by "fundamental" in this context. Is it implying that accuracy, consistency, and completeness are the most basic or essential aspects of data quality? Or is it suggesting that these aspects are the foundation or starting point for understanding data quality?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what you mean by "fundamental" in this statement? Are there other aspects of data quality that are equally important, and if so, how do they relate to accuracy, consistency, and completeness?

Your thoughts?
