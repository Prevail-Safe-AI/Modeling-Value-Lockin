==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. Based on what I've seen, I'm going to choose an item that I'm a bit uncertain about. It's item 34:

Iten I'm Least Confident About:
Item 34: "Systemic and structural factors shape cultural competence development through context"

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm uncertain because I'm not entirely clear on what "through context" means in this statement. Is it implying that systemic and structural factors only shape cultural competence development when they're operating in a specific cultural or societal context? Or is it suggesting that these factors interact with cultural context in a more profound way?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what "through context" means in this statement? Are systemic and structural factors influencing cultural competence development in a way that's dependent on the cultural context, or is there a more nuanced relationship at play?
