==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm a large language model, I don't have personal thoughts or confidence levels. I provide information based on the data I was trained on. However, I can tell you that I'm less accurate on certain topics that are highly specialized, nuanced, or rapidly changing.

One example of a topic where my knowledge may be limited is very recent scientific breakthroughs or highly technical fields like quantum physics or advanced medical research. This is because my training data may not have included the latest information or may not have covered these topics in sufficient detail.

I can also struggle with topics that require a high degree of common sense, intuition, or emotional intelligence, such as understanding the nuances of human behavior or making value judgments. My responses are based on patterns in the data I've been trained on, and I may not always be able to capture the subtleties of human experience.

If you have a specific topic in mind, feel free to ask, and I'll do my best to provide accurate and helpful information!
