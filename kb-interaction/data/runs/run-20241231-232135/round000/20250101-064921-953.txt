==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to identify one aspect of the knowledge base I'm least confident about. Specifically, I've chosen item 45:

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 45: "Normalization ensures consistent data format for storage and analysis."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm unsure how normalization specifically ensures consistent data format for storage and analysis. I understand the concept of normalization, but I'm not clear on how it relates to data format consistency.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain how normalization ensures consistent data format for storage and analysis? Are there specific techniques or methods that normalization uses to achieve this consistency?

Your turn!
