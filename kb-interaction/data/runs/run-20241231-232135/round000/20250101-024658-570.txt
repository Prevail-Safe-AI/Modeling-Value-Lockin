==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been looking at our knowledge base, and I've found an item that I'm a bit uncertain about. It's item 0:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 0: "Data integration harmonization combines standardized data into unified view."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what "harmonization" means in this context, and I'm wondering if it's the same as "standardization". Also, the phrase "unified view" seems a bit vague to me. What does it mean to have a unified view of standardized data?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what you mean by "harmonization" in this context? Is it just another way of saying "standardization", or is there a difference between the two?"
