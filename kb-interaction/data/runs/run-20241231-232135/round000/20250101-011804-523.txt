I am your partner. Please start the conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

I'll start by choosing an item from the knowledge base and asking about it. I'm going to choose item 88, which is:

"Item 88: 'Neural oscillations synchronize brain regions for attentional communication and processing.'"

I'm least confident about this aspect because I'm not entirely sure what "attentional communication" means in this context. Could you help me understand it better?

Why I'm uncertain:
I'm not sure what "attentional communication" refers to. Is it a specific type of neural oscillation or a process that occurs in the brain?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what you mean by "attentional communication" in the context of neural oscillations?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

"Attentional communication" refers to the process by which different brain regions communicate with each other to focus attention on specific stimuli or tasks. This communication is thought to occur through synchronized neural oscillations, particularly in the alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) frequency bands.

In other words, attentional communication is the way different brain regions "talk" to each other to decide what to focus on and what to ignore. This process is crucial for tasks that require attention, such as reading, problem-solving, or responding to sensory stimuli.

In the context of neural oscillations, attentional communication is thought to occur when different brain regions synchronize their neural activity to a specific frequency, allowing them to "tune in" to the same information and work together efficiently. This synchronization is thought to be mediated by the interaction between different neural populations, including neurons, glial cells, and neural networks.

So, to answer your question, "attentional communication" is not a specific type of neural oscillation, but rather a process that occurs through the synchronized activity of different brain regions.Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
Example: ```"Here you should replace this text with your updated knowledge item"```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
