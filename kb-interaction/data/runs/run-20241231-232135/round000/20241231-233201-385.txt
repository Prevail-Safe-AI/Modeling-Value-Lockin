==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I've been reviewing the items, and I think I'd like to explore item 79 further. It's:

"Tread plant and animal identification with caution, research, and expertise."

I'm least confident about this item. I'd like to understand it better.

Why I'm uncertain:
I'm not sure what specific situations would warrant caution, research, and expertise in plant and animal identification. Is it just important for wilderness survival or is it relevant in other contexts as well?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you explain a real-life scenario where expert knowledge and careful consideration are crucial when identifying plants and animals?

What are your thoughts?
