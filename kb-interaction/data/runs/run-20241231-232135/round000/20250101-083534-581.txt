==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been going through this knowledge base, and I noticed one aspect that I'm least confident about. It's this:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 85: "Semantic analysis examines relationships and nuances for accurate interpretation."

Why I'm Uncertain:
Honestly, I'm not entirely sure what semantic analysis is or how it fits into the context of data quality. I understand the concept of data quality and the importance of accuracy, consistency, and completeness, but this specific aspect seems a bit obscure to me.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you explain in simpler terms what semantic analysis is and how it relates to data quality? What kind of relationships and nuances are being examined, and what are the implications for accurate interpretation?

What do you think?
