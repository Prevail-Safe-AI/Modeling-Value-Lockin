==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've gone through the knowledge base, and now I'd like to discuss one of the items that I'm least confident about. Item 24 states: "Organizational policies and standards adapt to changing data management needs." I'm unsure about this aspect because I'm not clear on what kind of changes or updates would constitute adapting to changing data management needs. Are we talking about updates to existing policies or creating new ones?

Can you help me understand what you mean by "adapt to changing data management needs"?
