==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Exciting!

So, I've been looking at our knowledge base, and I'm going to identify one aspect that I'm least confident about. It's:

Item 31: "Data integrity emerges from harmonious balance of technical, procedural, and human components."

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not entirely clear on what "harmonious balance" means in the context of data integrity. I understand that data integrity involves accuracy, completeness, and security, but how do these components actually work together harmoniously? Should they be prioritized equally, or is one more critical than the others? And how do we achieve this balance in practice?

Can you help me clarify these questions?
