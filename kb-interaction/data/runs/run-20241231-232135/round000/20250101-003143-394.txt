==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss Item 93 from the knowledge base:

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 93: "Cognitive biases can distort emotional intelligence through systematic errors."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what it means by "systematic errors". Are these errors in the way we process information, or maybe in how we learned to interact with others?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you clarify what "systematic errors" refer to in this context, and how they specifically relate to cognitive biases and emotional intelligence?

What are your thoughts?
