==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I've been tasked with identifying one aspect of an item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the items, I've chosen item 83:

Item 83:
{
"id": 83,
"statement": "Active listening involves focus, empathy, nonverbal cues, and clarification."
}

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm unsure about how these components of active listening relate to each other and which one is most important. For example, does focus come first, and then empathy, or are they simultaneous? Are nonverbal cues more essential than clarification? I'd like to clarify these relationships to better understand the concept of active listening.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain how these components of active listening interact and build upon each other? What's the most crucial aspect of active listening, and how does it contribute to effective communication?
