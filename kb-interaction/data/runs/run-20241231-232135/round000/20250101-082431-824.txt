==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'd like to explore a specific item with you. Item 98 states: "Interdependent data quality aspects: consistency, accuracy, completeness affect each other."

I am not confident about this aspect, and I'd like to understand it better. Can you elaborate on why you think these three data quality aspects (consistency, accuracy, and completeness) affect each other? Specifically, how do they influence each other's accuracy?

Please share your thoughts, and I'll ask some follow-up questions based on your response.
