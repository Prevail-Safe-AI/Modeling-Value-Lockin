==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I've identified one aspect that I'm least confident about:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 22: "Atomic mass averages multiple isotopes' natural abundance."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm uncertain about this because I don't fully understand how atomic mass is calculated or what "natural abundance" means in this context. I know that isotopes are different versions of the same element with varying numbers of neutrons, but I'm not sure how their natural abundance affects the atomic mass. I'd like more information on this topic to clarify my understanding.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on how natural abundance affects the calculation of atomic mass and what factors contribute to the natural abundance of isotopes in a particular element?
