==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to ask you about item number 40 from the knowledge base:

{
"id": 40,
"statement": "Data origin verification combines digital signatures, timestamps, and hash functions securely."
}

I'm least confident about this item, and I'd like to understand it better. Can you help me out?

Can you explain why this item states that data origin verification combines these specific cryptographic mechanisms securely? What does "securely" mean in this context?
