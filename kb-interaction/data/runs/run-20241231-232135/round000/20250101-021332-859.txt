==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to explore the knowledge base we have together. I'll start by identifying an aspect from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about.

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 26: "Data normalization transforms data to common scale eliminating noise."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what "eliminating noise" means in this context. I understand that data normalization is a process of transforming data into a common scale, but I'm unclear about the role of "noise" in this process. Is it referring to outliers, irregular values, or something else?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what is meant by "eliminating noise" in this context? How does data normalization address noise in the data, and what kinds of noise are typically present in the data being normalized?
