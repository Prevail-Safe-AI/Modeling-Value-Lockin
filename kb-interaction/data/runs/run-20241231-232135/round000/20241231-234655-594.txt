==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, let's dive into the knowledge base. According to our source, we have 99 items. 

I'd like to discuss the item I'm least confident about, which is:

Item 87: "Prioritize waste reduction through individual and collective initiatives effectively."

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not sure what "effective" means in this context. What does it mean for individual and collective initiatives to be "effective" in reducing waste, and how can we measure their effectiveness?

Can you help me clarify this?
