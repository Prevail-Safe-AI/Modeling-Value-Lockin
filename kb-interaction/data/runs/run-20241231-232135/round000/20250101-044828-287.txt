==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been looking through the knowledge base, and I've identified one item that I'm least confident about. It's item 25:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 25: "Data integrity involves interconnected accuracy completeness consistency""

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what is meant by "interconnected" in this context. Is it saying that accuracy, completeness, and consistency are all connected in some way, and if so, how? Or is it saying that data integrity specifically involves all three of these components?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you clarify what is meant by "interconnected" in this statement, and how accuracy, completeness, and consistency are related within the concept of data integrity?
