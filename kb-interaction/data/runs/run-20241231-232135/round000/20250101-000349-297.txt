==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm going to ask you about one of the items from the knowledge base. Item 91 is one that I'm least confident about:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 91: 'Cultural competence involves nuanced understanding, empathy, and self-awareness.'"

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what nuanced understanding means in the context of cultural competence. Is it referring to a deep understanding of specific cultural practices or beliefs? And how does empathy come into play here?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what is meant by "nuanced understanding" in this context, and how it relates to empathy and self-awareness in cultural competence?
