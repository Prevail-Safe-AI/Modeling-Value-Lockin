==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been asked to identify one aspect of this knowledge base item that I'm least confident about. The item is:

Item 81:
{
"id": 81,
"statement": "Data integrity ensures internal consistency and validity through normalization, validation, cleansing, and governance."
}

I'm not entirely confident about the aspect that connects data integrity with normalization, validation, cleansing, and governance. Could you help me understand how these concepts are related in this context?

Specifically, I'd like to know more about how normalization, validation, cleansing, and governance contribute to ensuring internal consistency and validity in data integrity. Can you elaborate on this?
