==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been tasked with identifying an aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about, and I've chosen item 86:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 86: 'Geographic and socio-economic barriers hinder healthcare access through infrastructure availability.'"

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not sure how exactly infrastructure availability affects healthcare access. I know that lack of infrastructure can hinder access to healthcare resources, but I'm unclear on the specific mechanisms by which this happens.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you help me understand how infrastructure availability affects healthcare access? For example, what types of infrastructure are most important for healthcare access, and how do they impact healthcare outcomes?

What do you think?
