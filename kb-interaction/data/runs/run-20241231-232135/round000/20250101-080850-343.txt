==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'd like to identify one aspect that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the knowledge base, I've chosen an item that I'm not entirely sure about:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 91: "Effective governance relies on aligned people, processes, and technologies."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm uncertain about this item because it seems straightforward, but I'm not sure what the specific implications of "aligned" mean in this context. For example, what does "aligned" mean in terms of the relationship between people, processes, and technologies? Are there any specific scenarios or situations where this alignment is crucial? I'd like to clarify this concept to better understand the relationship between governance, people, processes, and technologies.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what "aligned" means in this context, and provide some examples of situations where effective governance requires alignment between people, processes, and technologies?
