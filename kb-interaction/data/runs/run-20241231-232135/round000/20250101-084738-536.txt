==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss one specific item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. It's:

Item 19: "Data quality affects data integrity and accuracy directly."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what is meant by "directly" in this statement. Does it mean that data quality has a cause-and-effect relationship with data integrity and accuracy, or is it saying that data quality is a necessary condition for data integrity and accuracy? I'm not confident about the exact relationship between these concepts.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you explain what you mean by "directly" in this statement? Are data quality, integrity, and accuracy related in a way that's more complex than a simple cause-and-effect relationship, or is it a straightforward correlation?
