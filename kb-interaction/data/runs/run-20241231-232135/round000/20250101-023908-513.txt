==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the knowledge base we were given. One item in particular caught my attention, and I'd like to get your thoughts on it. It's item 79: "Data integration involves steps: discovery, profiling, mapping, fusion, and quality."

I'm not entirely confident about this aspect of data integration. Can you elaborate on why you think these steps are necessary or how they work together to achieve a successful data integration process?

Also, are there any specific scenarios or use cases where you think these steps might not be sufficient or might need additional steps?
