Item 8: "Data trustworthiness encompasses multifaceted factors beyond accuracy notably"

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what "notably" means in this context. Is it emphasizing that there are many factors beyond accuracy that contribute to trustworthiness, or is it implying that those factors are significant but not necessarily widely recognized?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand the significance of "notably" in this statement? Are there any examples of factors that would be commonly overlooked but are important contributors to trustworthiness?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

"Notably" is an adverb that means "remarkably" or "significantly". In this context, it's emphasizing that there are many factors beyond accuracy that contribute to trustworthiness, and that these factors are significant, but not necessarily widely recognized.

In other words, it's highlighting that accuracy is not the only factor that determines trustworthiness, and that there are other important factors that are often overlooked. These factors might include things like data provenance, data quality, data relevance, data completeness, data consistency, and data security, among others.

For example, data provenance refers to the origin and history of the data, which can affect its trustworthiness. Data quality refers to the accuracy and completeness of the data, but also includes factors like data normalization, data cleansing, and data transformation. Data relevance refers to whether the data is relevant to the specific use case or application, and data completeness refers to whether the data is complete and lacks any gaps or missing values.

These factors are often overlooked because they are not as straightforward as accuracy, but they are important contributors to trustworthiness.
