==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been going through the knowledge base, and I've identified one aspect that I'm least confident about. It's the item with the statement:

`
{
  "id": 32,
  "statement": "Data mapping defines relationships between data elements in integration."
}
`

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not entirely clear on what "data mapping" exactly means in the context of data integration. I understand that it's a step in the integration process, but I'm not sure what specific actions or tasks are involved in data mapping.

Can you help me clarify what data mapping is and what it entails?
