==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm here to discuss my understanding of the knowledge base. One aspect that I'm least confident about is:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 2: "Encryption provides confidentiality, authenticity, integrity through cryptographic mechanisms."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure how encryption manages to provide all three - confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity - through a single mechanism. It seems like these are three separate concepts that might require different approaches. For instance, confidentiality seems to be about keeping data secret, while authenticity is about verifying the identity of the data source. 

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you explain how encryption manages to provide all three confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity through cryptographic mechanisms? Is it possible to achieve one without the others, or are there specific scenarios where one becomes compromised while the others remain intact?

What do you think?
