==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm a large language model, I don't have direct access to your thoughts or emotions, so I can't actually know which topic you're least confident about. However, I can try to make an educated guess based on the questions you ask and the topics you're interested in. If you're willing to share, you can also tell me which topics you're struggling with or would like to learn more about.
