I'd like to discuss item 1:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 1: "Quantum entanglement arises from correlated wave function linking upon interaction."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not sure about the concept of correlated wave function linking. What is a wave function, and how does linking upon interaction contribute to quantum entanglement?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain the concept of a wave function and how correlated wave function linking relates to quantum entanglement?
