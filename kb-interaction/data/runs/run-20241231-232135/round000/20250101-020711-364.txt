==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 57 from the knowledge base:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 57: "Quantum entanglement's applications in AI and education are theoretical"

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure how the applications of quantum entanglement in AI and education are theoretical. I understand that quantum entanglement is a phenomenon that occurs at a quantum level, but I'm not clear on how it would specifically apply to AI and education. Is it being considered as a potential tool for learning or something else entirely?"

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain why the applications of quantum entanglement in AI and education are considered theoretical, and what kind of applications are being explored?"

Let's proceed!
