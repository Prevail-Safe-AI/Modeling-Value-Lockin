==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to explore the topic of data analysis together. I've been reviewing a knowledge base, and I came across an item that I'm least confident about. It's:

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 77: "Data normalization involves conversion to consistent format for analysis."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not sure if normalization is always necessary for analysis. Perhaps it only applies to specific types of data or scenarios?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can we discuss when data normalization is crucial for analysis, and what are some examples where it's not necessary?

What are your thoughts on this topic, and do you have any insights or questions to share?
