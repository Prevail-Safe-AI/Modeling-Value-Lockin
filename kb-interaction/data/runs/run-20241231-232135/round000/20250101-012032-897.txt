==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to talk about the knowledge base we have here. I've been reviewing it, and I've identified one aspect that I'm least confident about. It's item #16:

"Cognitive biases are influenced by emotional and logical factors in decision-making processes."

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not entirely sure how these emotional and logical factors interact with each other to influence cognitive biases. I'm also wondering if cognitive biases can be influenced by other factors beyond emotional and logical ones.

Can you help me understand this better? Maybe we can discuss some examples or scenarios that illustrate how these factors interact?
