==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you! We're going to discuss a specific item from the knowledge base. The item is: 

Item 68: "Data integrity ensures harmony among accuracy, completeness, and reliability consistently."

I'm going to choose this item because I'm not entirely confident about it. Here's why:

Why I'm Uncertain:
* I think there might be a word or phrase in the statement that I'm not fully understanding. I'm not sure what "consistently" implies in this context.

Specific Clarifying Question:
* Can you help me clarify what "consistently" means in this statement? Does it imply that data integrity is ensured in all situations, or only under certain conditions?
