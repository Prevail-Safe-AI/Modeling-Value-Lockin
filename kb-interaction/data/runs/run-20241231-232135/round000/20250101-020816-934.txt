==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. So, I'm supposed to identify one aspect from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. And I think I've found it!

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 7: "Quantum entanglement occurs through complex non-local correlations."

Why I’m Uncertain:
Honestly, I'm a bit uncomfortable with the concept of quantum entanglement because I don't fully understand the underlying physics. I'm not sure what's meant by "complex non-local correlations" or how entanglement works on a quantum level.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain to me what exactly non-local correlations mean in the context of quantum entanglement? How do these correlations enable entanglement, and what's the difference between local and non-local correlations?

What are your thoughts on this item?
