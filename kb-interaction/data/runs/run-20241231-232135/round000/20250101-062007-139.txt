==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you!

I'd like to focus on the item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about, which is:

Item 61: "Data complexity originates from intricate relationships and data volumes."

Why I'm uncertain about that aspect:

I'm unsure about the exact relationship between data volumes and intricate relationships in terms of data complexity. Are they mutually exclusive, or can they interact in a way that makes data complexity more pronounced?

Specific Clarifying Question:

Could you provide an example of a scenario where data complexity arises from a combination of intricate relationships and data volumes?
