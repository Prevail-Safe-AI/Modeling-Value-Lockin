==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been examining the knowledge base we have, and I'm not feeling very confident about Item 59. It says: "Consistency necessary but insufficient for data quality alone, accuracy, completeness, relevance, and timeliness matter".

I'm not sure why, but I'm having trouble understanding this statement. It seems pretty straightforward - consistency is important, but other factors are also important. But the phrase "insufficient" bothers me. What do you think it means by "insufficient"? Do you think consistency is only a small part of data quality, or is it something else entirely?

And what do you think "accuracy, completeness, relevance, and timeliness" refer to? Are these just other types of consistency? Or are they separate aspects of data quality?
