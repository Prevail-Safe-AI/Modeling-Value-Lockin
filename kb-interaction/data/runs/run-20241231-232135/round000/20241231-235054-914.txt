==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'd like to identify one aspect of it that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the knowledge base, I've chosen item 13:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 13: "Active listening involves focus, empathy, nonverbal cues, and clarification."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what "clarification" means in the context of active listening. Is it just about confirming understanding or is there more to it?"

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what you mean by "clarification" in active listening? How does it differ from just confirming understanding?"
