==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss Item 25, which is "Data normalization transforms data formats for consistency and compatibility." I'm least confident about this item, and I'd like to understand it better.

Why I'm uncertain:

I'm not entirely sure what "data normalization" means in the context of data integration. Is it referring to converting data formats from one type to another, such as converting text data to numerical data?

Specific Clarifying Questions:

1. Can you explain the steps involved in data normalization in data integration? Is it a one-time process or an ongoing process?
2. How does data normalization ensure consistency and compatibility? Is it solely for mathematical operations or also for data visualization and analysis?
3. Are there specific tools or techniques used for data normalization, or is it more of a manual process?

Please help me clarify my understanding of this item!
