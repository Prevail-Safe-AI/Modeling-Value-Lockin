==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been provided with a knowledge base, and I've identified one item that I'm least confident about. It's:

Item 38: "Cognitive biases operate through both conscious and unconscious mechanisms."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm uncertain about this item because while I understand that cognitive biases are a well-studied topic in psychology, I'm not entirely convinced that biases can operate through both conscious and unconscious mechanisms. I'd like to know more about the research that supports this idea.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain how cognitive biases can operate through both conscious and unconscious mechanisms? What are some specific examples of biases that demonstrate this dual operation?

Please let me know your thoughts!
