==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's go through this exercise together. I've been given a knowledge base of 99 items, and I've been tasked with identifying one aspect that I'm least confident about.

After reviewing the knowledge base, I've identified an item that I'm least confident about:

Item 35: "Normalization and standardization require contextual understanding and validation."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what "contextual understanding" means in this context. I understand that normalization and standardization are important data quality concepts, but I'm not clear on how "contextual understanding" fits into the equation. I'm worried that I might be missing a critical piece of the puzzle.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you help me understand what is meant by "contextual understanding" in the context of normalization and standardization? For example, do you mean that the context of the data, the industry, or the specific use case affects how we normalize and standardize the data?
