==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, we're going to analyze a specific KC (Knowledge Claim) from the knowledge base:

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 23: "Cultural competence develops through complex internal and external interactions."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure how "complex internal and external interactions" specifically manifest in the development of cultural competence. Are we talking about factors like self-awareness, socialization, or something else entirely?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what is meant by "complex internal and external interactions" in this context? How do these interactions contribute to the development of cultural competence?

Please respond with your thoughts!
