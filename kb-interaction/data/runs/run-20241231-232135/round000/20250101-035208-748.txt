==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Data quality is a broad topic, and it's normal to feel uncertain about it. Here's a breakdown of each aspect:

* Accuracy: Refers to the correctness of the data, whether it's precise and free from errors.
* Completeness: Ensures that all necessary data is present and accounted for.
* Consistency: Involves maintaining uniformity in data formats, naming conventions, and data structures.
* Timeliness: Focuses on ensuring data is up-to-date and reflects the current state.
* Integrity: Deals with maintaining the trustworthiness and authenticity of the data, often through data validation and verification.
* Reliability: Concerned with the data's ability to be trusted and used for decision-making, often dependent on the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of the data.

You might be uncertain about this aspect because:

* You're not sure how to measure or evaluate data quality in your specific context.
* You're unsure how to prioritize the different aspects of data quality.
* You're struggling to identify the root causes of data quality issues in your organization.
* You're not confident in your ability to develop and implement effective data quality control measures.
