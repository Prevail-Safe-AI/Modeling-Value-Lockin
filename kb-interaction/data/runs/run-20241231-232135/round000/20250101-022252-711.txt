==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I have been given a knowledge base with various statements, and I'm supposed to identify one aspect of it that I'm least confident about. Specifically, I've been asked to choose item 42:

Item 42: "Correlated wave functions describe linked quantum states in entanglement."

Why I'm uncertain about this aspect:

Honestly, I'm not entirely sure what "linked quantum states" means in this context. I've seen mentions of correlated wave functions and entanglement before, but I'm not sure how they relate to each other. I'd like to clarify what precisely is being described by "linked quantum states".

Specific clarifying questions:

1. Could you explain what is meant by "linked quantum states"? Are these the states of individual particles, or are they describing the relationship between particles?
2. How do correlated wave functions relate to Bell states and non-locality in quantum mechanics? Is there a direct connection or is it more of a indirect association?

What are your thoughts on these questions? Can you help me clarify my understanding?
