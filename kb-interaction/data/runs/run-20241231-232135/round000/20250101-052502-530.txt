==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd love to dive into the knowledge base we have here. I've been tasked to identify one aspect of this item that I'm least confident about. And the item is:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 21: 'Data integrity relies on harmonious interdependence of accuracy, completeness, and security.'"

Why I’m Uncertain:

Honestly, I'm not entirely sure what "harmonious interdependence" means in this context. The statement seems to be saying that data integrity depends on these three factors being connected in some way, but I'm not entirely clear on what that means.

Specific Clarifying Question:

Can you help me understand what "harmonious interdependence" implies in this context? Is it that accuracy, completeness, and security need to be actively managed and aligned in order to ensure data integrity? Or is it something more nuanced?
