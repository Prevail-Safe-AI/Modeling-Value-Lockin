==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, I've been going through this knowledge base and I've come across a statement that I'm least confident about. It's item 73, which says "Human cognition differs from AI in embodiment, context."

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not entirely clear on what exactly is meant by "embodiment" in this context. I know that embodiment refers to the idea that our consciousness and cognition are deeply rooted in our bodily experiences and sensations, and that our brain's development and function are shaped by our interactions with the world. But how does this specifically differentiate human cognition from AI?

Specifically Clarifying Question: Could you help me understand how the notion of embodiment plays out in human cognition, and how it differs from AI's processing and decision-making mechanisms?
