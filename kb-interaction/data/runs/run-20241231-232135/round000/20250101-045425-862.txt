==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss one of the items from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about, which is:

Item 11: "Data integrity relies on interconnected accuracy, completeness, and reliability principles."

Why I'm Uncertain:
To be honest, I'm not sure why accuracy, completeness, and reliability are the only three principles mentioned. Are they the most important ones? How do they interact with each other and with other principles to ensure data integrity? Are there other principles that are also crucial?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you elaborate on why only accuracy, completeness, and reliability are mentioned as interconnected principles? Are there other principles that play a role in ensuring data integrity as well?

Your thoughts?
