==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss one of the items from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. The item is: 

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 49: "Data governance ensures quality, consistency, and standards for harmonization"

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure about the relationship between data governance and harmonization. How do consistent standards for harmonization ensure data governance? Is it the other way around, or are they complementary concepts in the context of data management?"

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you provide an example of how data governance ensures quality, consistency, and standards for harmonization in a real-world scenario?"
