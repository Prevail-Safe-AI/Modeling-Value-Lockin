==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been reviewing the knowledge base we have, and I noticed that we have a lot of information about data integration, neuroplasticity, and quantum entanglement. But when I came across item 14: "Entangled particles' joint probability distribution is described by correlated wave functions," I have to admit that I'm not entirely confident about it.

Can you help me understand why we would need to describe entangled particles' joint probability distribution? What does that even mean? And how does it relate to correlated wave functions?

Also, I was wondering if you could clarify the difference between correlated wave functions and correlated properties in the context of quantum entanglement?

Thanks for your help!
