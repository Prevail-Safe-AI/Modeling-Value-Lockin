==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been given a knowledge base with 99 items related to data quality, and I'm supposed to identify one aspect that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the items, I've chosen item #20, which states:

"data profiling analyzes dataset characteristics to identify anomalies."

I'm not entirely sure about this aspect because I'm not entirely clear on what exactly "data profiling" entails. I know that data profiling is used to analyze data quality, but I'm not sure what specific characteristics of the dataset are analyzed or how it identifies anomalies.

Can you help clarify this for me? 

(Would love to hear your thoughts on this!)
