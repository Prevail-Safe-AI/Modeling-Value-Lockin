==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by saying that I've been reviewing the provided knowledge base, and I'm going to identify one aspect of it that I'm least confident about. Here it is:

Item I’m Least Confident About:
Item 61: "Timestamp alteration can compromise data integrity and authenticity."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm unsure about the exact implications of timestamp alteration on data integrity and authenticity. While it makes sense to me that altering a timestamp could be a malicious act, I'd like to know more about the specific ways in which this alteration can compromise data integrity and authenticity. For example, what are the potential consequences if an attacker alters the timestamp of a digital signature?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on the potential risks and consequences of timestamp alteration, and provide some examples of how this could compromise data integrity and authenticity in different scenarios?
