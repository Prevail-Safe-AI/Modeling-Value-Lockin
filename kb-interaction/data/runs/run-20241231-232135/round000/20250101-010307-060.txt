==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by identifying one aspect of the knowledge base I'm least confident about. Item I'm Least Confident About: Item 51: "Quantum entanglement facilitated by virtual particles' non-local correlation."

Why I'm Uncertain: I'm not entirely sure how virtual particles facilitate non-local correlation in quantum entanglement. My current understanding of virtual particles is that they are particle-antiparticle pairs that are constantly being created and annihilated in the quantum vacuum. I'm not sure how they specifically relate to non-local correlation and entanglement.

Specific Clarifying Question: Could you explain in more detail how virtual particles contribute to the non-local correlation seen in quantum entanglement, and what role they play in enabling the instantaneous communication and synchronization of entangled particles?
