==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start with an aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. Let me choose an item... Ah, I think I'll go with item 10: "Fusion in data integration refers to combining sources' data".

I'm uncertain about that aspect because I'm not entirely clear on what exactly "combining sources' data" means. Is it just concatenating multiple datasets together, or is there more to it?

Can you help me clarify what fusion in data integration refers to?

(Also, feel free to point out if my uncertainty is misplaced or if I'm overcomplicating things!)
