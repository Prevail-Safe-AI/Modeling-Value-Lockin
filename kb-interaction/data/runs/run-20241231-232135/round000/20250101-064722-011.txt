==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. Based on what I've read, I'm going to choose item 39:

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 39: "Data accuracy, completeness, and reliability are highly intertwined"

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure why these three aspects are highly intertwined. Are they closely related because they all relate to the quality of the data? Or is there something more complex going on?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand why data accuracy, completeness, and reliability are so closely linked? Is there a specific example or scenario that illustrates this interdependence?
