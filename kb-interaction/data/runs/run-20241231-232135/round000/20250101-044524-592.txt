==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, I've been reviewing the knowledge base, and one aspect that stands out to me as being unclear is Item 37: "Data discovery combines human judgment and automation harmoniously."

I need to admit that I'm not entirely confident about this aspect. I'm not sure what exactly is meant by "harmoniously" in this context, or what specific steps or processes are involved in combining human judgment and automation in data discovery.

Can you provide some clarification on what you think is meant by "harmoniously" and how this combination works in practice?

Also, are there any specific examples or scenarios where human judgment and automation are combined in data discovery, and what are the benefits of doing so?

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this!
