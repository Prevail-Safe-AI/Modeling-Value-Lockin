==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Based on our knowledge base, I'd like to start by identifying one aspect that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the statements, I've chosen item 54:

"Active listening enhances understanding by combining encoding, attention, emotional intelligence, and reduced biases."

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not entirely clear on how emotional intelligence plays a role in active listening. I understand the importance of attention and encoding in the message-processing part, but I'm not sure how emotional intelligence exactly contributes to enhancing understanding. Can you help me clarify this aspect?
