==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been reviewing the knowledge base, and I'd like to discuss one aspect that I'm least confident about. The item I'm referring to is:

Item 82: "Data integrity requires balance of organizational, technical, and human complexities."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what this statement means by "balance of complexities". How do organizational, technical, and human complexities affect data integrity, and what does it mean to balance them? Are there specific examples or scenarios where one complexity might be more dominant than others?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you provide an example of a situation where data integrity is compromised because of an imbalance of complexities, and how would you suggest balancing these complexities to ensure data integrity?
