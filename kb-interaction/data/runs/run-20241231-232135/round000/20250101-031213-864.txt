==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been going through the knowledge base, and I've come across an item that I'm least confident about. It's:

Item 80: "Data standardization involves continuous refinement and monitoring process"

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm unsure about the exact scope and implications of "continuous refinement and monitoring process" in data standardization. Is it a one-time effort or an ongoing process? What are the specific steps involved in each refinement and monitoring cycle?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what kind of continuous refinement and monitoring process is involved in data standardization, and how it ensures data quality and consistency over time?

What are your thoughts on this?
