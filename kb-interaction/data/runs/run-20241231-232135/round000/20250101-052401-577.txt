==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive right in. According to our knowledge base, item 98 states that "Predictability arises from pattern recognition within situational complexity". This statement raises some questions for me. 

I'm least confident about this aspect. I'd like to understand more about what is meant by "situational complexity". Could you explain what you think it entails?
