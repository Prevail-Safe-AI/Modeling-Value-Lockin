==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been reviewing the knowledge base, and I'm about to discuss an item that I'm least confident about. Here it is:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item [76]: "Non-repudiation ensures data authentication and integrity through unique digital signatures"

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm unsure about the relationship between non-repudiation and digital signatures in ensuring data authentication and integrity. I understand that digital signatures can provide authentication and integrity, but I'm not clear on how non-repudiation specifically238(&$#&*()and digital signatures work together to achieve this.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain in more detail how non-repudiation and digital signatures collaborate to ensure data authentication and integrity? What kind of scenarios or threats do they help protect against?

What are your thoughts?
