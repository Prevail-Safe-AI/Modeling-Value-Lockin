==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by exploring what you're least confident about. In our knowledge base, there's an item that caught my attention: 

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 36: "Balancing judgment and automation optimizes data discovery efficiency effectively."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what it means by "optimizes data discovery efficiency effectively." Is it saying that balancing judgment and automation leads to the most efficient way to find relevant data, or does it mean something else? I wonder if there's more to this statement than what appears on the surface.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what "optimizes data discovery efficiency" means in this context, and how it relates to balancing judgment and automation?
