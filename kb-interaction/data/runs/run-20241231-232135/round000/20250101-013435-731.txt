==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm glad to chat with you about this knowledge base. I've been analyzing the statements, and I've identified one aspect that I'm least confident about. It's:

Item 50: "Systemic and structural factors shape cultural competence through complex influences."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely convinced about the relationship between systemic and structural factors and cultural competence. The statement seems to imply that these factors have a significant impact on cultural competence, but I'm not sure how or why that's the case.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what kind of systemic and structural factors are being referred to in this statement? For example, are we talking about societal norms, education systems, economic structures, or something else entirely?

Please let me know if you have any insights or if you'd like to elaborate on this concept!
