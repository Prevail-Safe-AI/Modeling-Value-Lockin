==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss one of the statements from the knowledge base. Specifically, I'm looking at item 15:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 15: "Cultural competence develops through continuous self-awareness, learning, practice, and feedback cycle."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not sure how 'continuous self-awareness' fits into the model. Is it a one-time process, or is it an ongoing aspect of cultural competence development? For example, do individuals need to regularly reflect on their own biases and assumptions to ensure continuous self-awareness, or is it a more static concept?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain to me how you see 'continuous self-awareness' playing a role in cultural competence development? Is it a necessary condition, or can cultural competence develop through other means as well?"
