==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been tasked to identify one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the knowledge base, I've identified an item that I'm least confident about, which is:

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 93: "Data normalization converts diverse formats into consistent structures."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm unsure about this aspect because I don't fully understand the concept of data normalization and how it converts diverse formats into consistent structures. I think it might be related to data preprocessing or cleaning, but I'm not certain about its specifics.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you please explain how data normalization converts diverse formats into consistent structures, providing an example of a scenario where this process would be useful?

What are your thoughts on this aspect?
