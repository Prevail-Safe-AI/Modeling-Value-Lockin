==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. Here it is:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 82: "Effective governance relies on aligning people, process, and technology harmoniously."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm uncertain about this aspect because I wonder what exactly harmonizing people, process, and technology means in real-world scenarios. It seems like a philosophical concept that may not be easily applicable to concrete situations. I'm also unclear about how such alignment can be achieved and maintained over time.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you walk me through a specific example of how aligning people, process, and technology works in practice? For instance, how would you handle conflicts or competing priorities when aligning these three components?
