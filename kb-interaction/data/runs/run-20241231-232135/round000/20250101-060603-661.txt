==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been tasked to identify one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about, and then elaborate on why I'm uncertain about it. After reviewing the knowledge base, I've chosen item 17:

"Item 17: Artificial General Intelligence requires high-level cognitive abilities."

Here's why I'm uncertain about this aspect:

"I'm unsure about this statement because I don't fully understand what 'high-level cognitive abilities' entails. Is it referring to specific cognitive functions, such as attention or memory, or is it a more abstract concept? Moreover, I'm not sure what constitutes 'high-level' cognitive abilities - are they simply a continuation of human-level abilities, or are they qualitatively different?"

Can you help me clarify these points? Do you have any insights or additional information that might help me better understand this aspect?
