==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Based on the knowledge base, I want to identify one aspect of it that I'm least confident about. After reviewing it, I've chosen item 62:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 62: "Data harmonization involves profiling, mapping, transformation, validation, quality control."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm unsure about the specific steps involved in data harmonization. Are these five steps (profiling, mapping, transformation, validation, and quality control) exhaustive or are there other important steps that are not mentioned here? I'm also not clear on how these steps are performed and what the optimal order is for each step.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain each step in more detail, and provide examples of how they are used in practice? Additionally, are there any specific tools or software that can aid in data harmonization following these steps?"
