==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm a large language model, I don't have personal opinions or emotions, but I can tell you that I'm less confident in providing information on very specific or niche topics that are outside my training data. For example, I may struggle with providing detailed information on the latest research in a specific field of science or technology that has been published recently. I'm also less confident in providing information on topics that require highly specialized knowledge or expertise, such as medical diagnosis or complex legal issues.
