==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to know more about our knowledge base. I've noticed that we have a large collection of statements about data integration, standardization, and normalization. One item that catches my attention is:

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 63: "Data standardization ensures uniform structure through formatting and validation"

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure how formatting and validation contribute to ensuring uniform structure in data standardization. Is it because formatting ensures that data is presented in a consistent manner, and validation checks that data is accurate and complete? Or are there other factors at play?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand the relationship between formatting, validation, and uniform structure in data standardization? Are there any specific scenarios or examples that illustrate how these factors work together to achieve uniformity?
