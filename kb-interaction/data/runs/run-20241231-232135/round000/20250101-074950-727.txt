==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to know your thoughts on item 58 from the knowledge base:

{
"id": 58,
"statement": "Governance ensures data consistency through standards, policies, and procedures."
}

I have to admit that I'm not entirely confident about this aspect. Could you tell me why you think governance ensures data consistency in this way? Is it because of the specific standards, policies, and procedures involved? Or is there something else at play?

Please share your thoughts, and I'll do the same!
