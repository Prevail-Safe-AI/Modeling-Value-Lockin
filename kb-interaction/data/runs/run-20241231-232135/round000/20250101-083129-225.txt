==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to talk about one of the statements from the knowledge base. Specifically, I'm least confident about:

Item 3: "Data quality dimensions include relevance and timeliness."

Why I'm Uncertain:

I'm not sure if "relevance" and "timeliness" are necessarily part of the fundamental data quality dimensions. I know that consistency, accuracy, and completeness are often considered the core aspects of data quality, but I'm not familiar with relevance and timeliness being explicit quality dimensions.

Specific Clarifying Question:

Can you help me understand what you mean by "relevance" as a data quality dimension? Is it related to the importance or applicability of the data, or is it something else entirely?
