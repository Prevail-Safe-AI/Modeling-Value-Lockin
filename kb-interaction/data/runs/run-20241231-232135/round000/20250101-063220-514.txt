==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by saying that I've been going through the knowledge base, and one aspect that I'm least confident about is the item:

Item 28: "Data standardization is insufficient without considering broader factors"

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what is meant by "broader factors" in this context. Are they referring to industry standards, regulations, or something else entirely? Additionally, I'm not clear on what the implications are if data standardization is not done considering these broader factors.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you help me understand what kind of broader factors are being referred to in this context, and how would you suggest considering them in data standardization?
