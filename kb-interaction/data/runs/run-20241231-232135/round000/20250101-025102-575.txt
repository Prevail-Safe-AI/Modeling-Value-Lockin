==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to explore our knowledge base together. Specifically, I'd like to discuss the statement I'm least confident about. According to our knowledge base, that statement is:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 82: "Data normalization improves quality by ensuring uniform scales and formats""

Why I’m Uncertain:

I'm unsure about this statement because I'm not entirely clear on what exactly "uniform scales and formats" mean in the context of data normalization. Are they referring to the type of data (e.g., numerical, categorical, etc.) or the way the data is represented (e.g., CSV, JSON, etc.)?

Specific Clarifying Question:

Can you help me understand what "uniform scales and formats" mean specifically in the context of data normalization? How does ensuring these uniform scales and formats actually improve data quality?

What's your take on this?
