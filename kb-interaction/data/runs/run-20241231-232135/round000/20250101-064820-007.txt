==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to learn more about the knowledge base. Specifically, I'd like to identify one aspect that I'm least confident about.

After reviewing the knowledge base, I've identified Item 73:

"Iten I'm Least Confident About:
Item 73: "Data integrity concerns accuracy, completeness, and consistency in all stages."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure about the scope of "all stages" in the statement. Does it refer to the entire data lifecycle, or is it specific to certain stages like data collection, processing, or storage?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you clarify what is meant by "all stages" in the context of data integrity, and provide examples of what these stages might include?"

What do you think?
