==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I've been going through it, and I've identified one aspect that I'm least confident about. It's item 21:

"Iten I'm Least Confident About:
Item 21: "Data quality ensures relevance and usefulness in trustworthiness"

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure how data quality ensures relevance and usefulness in trustworthiness. The statement seems to imply a direct connection between data quality and trustworthiness, but I'm not convinced that one necessarily leads to the other. Maybe there are some underlying factors or processes that I'm not grasping.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand how data quality ensures relevance and usefulness in trustworthiness? For example, are there specific mechanisms or best practices that I'm missing?"

What are your thoughts?
