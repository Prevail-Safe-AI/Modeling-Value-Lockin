==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. After reviewing it, I've identified one aspect that I'm least confident about, which is:

Item 15: "Maintaining cultural competence requires ongoing education, self-reflection, and feedback."

Why I'm Uncertain:
Honestly, I'm unclear about what "cultural competence" exactly means and how it applies to different contexts. I'd like to know more about what it entails and how one can practically maintain it.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you please explain what cultural competence means in this context and how I can develop it in my own life and/or work? For example, what does "ongoing education" look like, and how can I practice self-reflection and feedback to maintain it?

Your thoughts?
