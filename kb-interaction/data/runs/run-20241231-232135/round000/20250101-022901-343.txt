==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the knowledge base. I've been presented with 100 statements about data integration and quantum entanglement. I've read through them, but one statement stands out as being the one I'm least confident about. It's:

Item 92: "Data integration involves preprocessing, normalization, fusion, and machine learning steps"

Why I'm uncertain about that aspect:

I'm uncertain because while I understand that data integration is a process that involves different steps, I'm not entirely clear on what these specific steps entail. What is preprocessing, and how does it differ from normalization? How does fusion relate to machine learning? I've seen these terms used separately, but I'm not confident in my understanding of how they fit together in the context of data integration.

Specific Clarifying Question:

Can you explain the relationship between preprocessing, normalization, fusion, and machine learning in the context of data integration? How do these steps contribute to the overall process, and what are some common challenges or limitations associated with each step?

What do you think? Do you have any insights or clarifications to share?
