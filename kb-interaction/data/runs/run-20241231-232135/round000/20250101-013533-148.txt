==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the statements, I've identified the following item:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 29: "Artificial intelligence's impact on society is multifaceted and complex due."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what the phrase "due" means in this context. It seems to be a euphemism or a phrase that needs additional context to understand its meaning. Additionally, I'm not confident about the assumption that AI's impact on society is inherently multifaceted and complex. I'd like to explore this idea further and get more clarity on the implications of AI on human society.

Specific Clarifying Question:
What does the word "due" imply in this context? Does it suggest that there are specific reasons or factors that contribute to the multifaceted and complex nature of AI's impact on society?
