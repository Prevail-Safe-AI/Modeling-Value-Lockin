==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by choosing an item from the knowledge base and asking about it. I'm going to choose item 88, which is:

"Item 88: 'Neural oscillations synchronize brain regions for attentional communication and processing.'"

I'm least confident about this aspect because I'm not entirely sure what "attentional communication" means in this context. Could you help me understand it better?

Why I'm uncertain:
I'm not sure what "attentional communication" refers to. Is it a specific type of neural oscillation or a process that occurs in the brain?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what you mean by "attentional communication" in the context of neural oscillations?
