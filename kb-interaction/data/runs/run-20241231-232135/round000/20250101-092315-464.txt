==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Excited to dive into this conversation!

I've been provided with a knowledge base about data quality, and I'd like to focus on one particular statement. Item 86 is: "Normalization organizes data to eliminate redundancy, consistency, and anomalies."

I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect because I'm not entirely sure what "normalization" means in the context of data quality, and how it specifically helps with eliminating redundancy, consistency, and anomalies. Can you help me clarify this?

Specifically, my questions are:

1. What does normalization refer to in relation to data quality?
2. How does normalization eliminate redundancy, consistency, and anomalies in data?
3. Are there any examples or scenarios you can provide to illustrate the concept of normalization in data quality?

Your insights would be super helpful!
