==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, I've been going through this knowledge base, and I've come across this item:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
 Item 78: "Cultural competence develops from systemic, structural & individual factors."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what this means. The phrase "systemic, structural & individual factors" sounds catch-all, but I'm not sure how these factors interact or what specific examples would illustrate this development process."

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you clarify what these factors mean, and how they contribute to the development of cultural competence?"

What do you think? Care to help me out?
