==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Based on the knowledge base, I'd like to identify one aspect of it that I'm least confident about. The item is:

Item 67: "Cultural competence develops through interconnected systemic, structural, individual interactions."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure how these three components (systemic, structural, and individual) interact with each other to develop cultural competence. I'd like to understand the specific mechanisms and relationships between them.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what each of these components means in the context of cultural competence development, and how they influence one another?

What are your thoughts?
