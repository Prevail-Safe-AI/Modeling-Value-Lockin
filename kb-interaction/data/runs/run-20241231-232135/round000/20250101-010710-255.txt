==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by talking about the knowledge base we have. According to our knowledge base, there are many statements related to artificial intelligence, cultural competence, neural oscillations, and quantum entanglement. 

I'd like to ask you about one aspect of the item from our knowledge base that I'm least confident about. It's item 12, which states: "Distributed attention processes multiple sources simultaneously with high accuracy." 

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I want to know more about how this distributed attention works and what specific sources it's referring to. I also want to know how this affects human cognition and decision-making.

Can you elaborate on why you're uncertain about this aspect?
