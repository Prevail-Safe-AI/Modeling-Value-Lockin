==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been going through the knowledge base, and I want to identify one aspect that I'm least confident about. I think I've found it:

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 20: "Data relevance ensures alignment with intended purpose, increasing trustworthiness"

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not sure how relevance directly contributes to trustworthiness. It seems like it might be a important factor, but I'd like to understand the relationship better. Also, I'm not clear what exactly is meant by "alignment with intended purpose".

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand how relevance affects trustworthiness? Are there any specific examples or scenarios where relevance is particularly important for trustworthiness?
