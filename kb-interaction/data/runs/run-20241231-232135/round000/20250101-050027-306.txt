==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss an item from our knowledge base that I'm not confident about, and get your feedback.

The item I've chosen is:

Item 46: "Data integrity arises from mutually dependent and interconnected principles."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm unsure about the phrase "mutually dependent and interconnected principles". Are these terms interchangeable, or do they have distinct meanings in the context of data integrity? Are there specific examples or scenarios where these principles are mutually dependent and interconnected?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what you mean by "mutually dependent and interconnected principles" in the context of data integrity? Are these principles always used together, or can they be applied separately?

Your thoughts?
