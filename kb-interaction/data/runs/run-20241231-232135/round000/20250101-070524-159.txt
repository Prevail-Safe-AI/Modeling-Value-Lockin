==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll be exploring our knowledge base to identify one aspect that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the statements, I've identified item 48:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 48: "Parity bits detect single-bit errors in digital data transmission"

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not fully clear on how parity bits work in detecting single-bit errors in digital data transmission. I understand the concept of parity bits in general, but I'm not sure about the specific mechanism or steps involved in detecting errors.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you explain in more detail how parity bits detect single-bit errors in digital data transmission? For example, what is the process, and how do parity bits calculate checksums to identify errors?
