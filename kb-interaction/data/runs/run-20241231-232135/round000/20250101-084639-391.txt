==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been reading through the knowledge base and one item that caught my attention is statement #3: "Consistency, accuracy, and completeness are interconnected data quality aspects."

I'm a bit unsure about this item. Can you help me understand why consistency, accuracy, and completeness are interconnected? Are there any specific examples or scenarios where these three aspects are directly related?

Also, what does it mean for these aspects to be "interconnected"? Are they mutually dependent, or do they influence each other in some way?
