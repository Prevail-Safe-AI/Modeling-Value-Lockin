==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss one of the items from the knowledge base. Specifically, item 87:

Item 87: "Data discovery harmoniously balances human judgment and automation."

Why am I uncertain about that aspect?
I'm uncertain because the term "harmoniously" feels a bit vague to me. What does that really mean in the context of data discovery? Is it just a nod to the importance of both human judgment and automation, or is there more subtlety to it?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what "harmoniously" means in this context? How do you see human judgment and automation being balanced in a way that's truly harmonious, rather than just having two competing methods?
