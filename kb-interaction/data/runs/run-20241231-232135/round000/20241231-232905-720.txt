==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to explore the knowledge base with you. Let's start with one of the items that I'm not very confident about. It's item 90:

"Iten I'm Least Confident About:
Item 90: 'Ensure informed consent through clear communication and explicit agreement.'"

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not sure what it means to "ensure informed consent" in a practical sense. Is it just about getting someone's explicit agreement before doing something, or is there more to it?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what "informed consent" means in this context and how to achieve it in everyday situations?

What are your thoughts on this item?
