==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the knowledge base we have. From what I've seen, it's a collection of statements about data quality, consistency, integrity, and related concepts.

Let's take item 94, for instance: "Data entanglement is an analogy for complex data relationships." I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect.

Why am I uncertain? Well, as far as I understand, "entanglement" is a concept from quantum mechanics, where particles become connected and affect each other even when separated by large distances. In the context of data relationships, I'm not sure how entanglement as an analogy would work. It seems like a bit of a stretch. So, I'd like to ask you a question to clarify my understanding:

Can you explain what you mean by "Data entanglement is an analogy for complex data relationships"? How do you see this concept applying to data connections?
