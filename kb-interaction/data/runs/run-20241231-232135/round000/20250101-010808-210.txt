==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to talk about item #27 from the knowledge base:

"Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 27: "Quantum entanglement demonstrates non-local connection between particles instantly."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure about the concept of quantum entanglement and how it works. I understand that it's a phenomenon where two particles are connected in such a way that their properties are correlated, regardless of the distance between them. But I'm not confident in my understanding of how this non-local connection happens.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain in simpler terms how quantum entanglement works? Like, what's actually happening at the quantum level that allows particles to be connected in this way?"

How would you respond to these thoughts?
