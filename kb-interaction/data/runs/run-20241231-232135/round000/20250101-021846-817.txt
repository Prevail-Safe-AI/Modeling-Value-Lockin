==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to explore item 62 from the knowledge base:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 62: "Multidisciplinary AI-assisted education integrates computer science, psychology, and education."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not sure why we need to integrate all three disciplines. Can we focus on just one or two? What's the value of combining computer science, psychology, and education in AI-assisted education?

Specific Clarifying Question:
What specific benefits does the integration of computer science, psychology, and education provide in AI-assisted education? How does it enhance the learning experience?
