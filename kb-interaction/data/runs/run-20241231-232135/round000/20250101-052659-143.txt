==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been browsing through the knowledge base and I've come across an item that I'm not very confident about. It's item 24, which states that "Entities in data representation have unique identities and characteristics".

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not sure what exactly is meant by "unique identities" and "characteristics" in the context of data representation. Are we talking about data attributes, metadata, or something else entirely? And what kind of relationships can these unique identities and characteristics have with other entities in the data representation?

Can you help me clarify this point?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you provide an example of what you mean by "unique identities" and "characteristics" in the context of data representation?
