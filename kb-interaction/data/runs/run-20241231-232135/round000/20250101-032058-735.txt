==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, I've been going through this knowledge base, and I'm supposed to identify one aspect of it that I'm least confident about. I chose item 99, which says "Data discovery involves structured or flexible processes depending". I'm not entirely sure about this aspect because I'm wondering, what does it actually mean for data discovery to have structured or flexible processes?

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not sure what "structured or flexible processes" implies in the context of data discovery. Is it referring to how data is typically discovered? Or is it referring to the methodology used in data discovery? Or maybe there are different scenarios where structured or flexible processes would be used?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you clarify what exactly is meant by "structured or flexible processes" in the context of data discovery? Are there specific scenarios where one would be more suitable than the other?
