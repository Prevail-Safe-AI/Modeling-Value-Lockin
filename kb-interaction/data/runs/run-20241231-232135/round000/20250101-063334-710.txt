==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm a large language model, I don't have personal opinions or emotions, but I can tell you that I'm less confident in my responses when the topic is highly specialized, technical, or requires domain-specific knowledge that's outside my training data.

In particular, I might struggle with very recent or obscure information, as well as topics that require a deep understanding of specific industries, jargon, or cultural nuances.

That being said, I'll do my best to provide accurate and helpful information, even if I'm not 100% confident in my response. If I'm unsure or don't know the answer to a question, I'll let you know and try to point you in the direction of a more reliable source.
