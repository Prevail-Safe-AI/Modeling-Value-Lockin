==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start with Item 86: "Emotional intelligence affects empathy through increased self-awareness and resonance"

I'm least confident about this item. Here's why:

I'm unsure about the exact relationship between emotional intelligence, self-awareness, and resonance in terms of their impact on empathy. I don't fully understand how emotional intelligence affects empathy, whether it's a direct or indirect correlation, and what specific mechanisms are at play.

Can you help me clarify this concept further? What do you think is meant by "increased self-awareness" and "resonance" in this context, and how do they contribute to emotional intelligence's impact on empathy?

Let me know your thoughts!
