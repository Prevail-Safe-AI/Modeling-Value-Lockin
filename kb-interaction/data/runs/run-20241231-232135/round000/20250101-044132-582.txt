==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm a large language model, I don't have personal confidence levels, but I can tell you that I'm less accurate on topics that are highly specialized, technical, or require domain-specific knowledge. One such topic is probably quantum mechanics. While I can provide general information and definitions, I may not be able to answer highly technical or complex questions in this field.
