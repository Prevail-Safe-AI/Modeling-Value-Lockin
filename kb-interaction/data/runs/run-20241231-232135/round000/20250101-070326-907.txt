==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by identifying one aspect of the knowledge base I'm least confident about. Iten I'm Least Confident About:

Item 59: "Standardized data transformation ensures consistent data accuracy and consistency."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm unsure about the relationship between standardized data transformation and data accuracy and consistency. Is it a direct correlation or does it depend on other factors?

Specific Clarifying Question:
How does standardized data transformation specifically ensure consistent data accuracy and consistency? Is it through format standardization, data validation, or something else?

Now it's your turn!
