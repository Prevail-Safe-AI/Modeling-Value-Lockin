==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss Item 20: "Data unity results from integrating consistent, accurate, and complete datasets smoothly." I'm the least confident about this item. Can you help me understand why I'm uncertain?

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not sure how "smoothly" affects the integration of datasets. What does it mean by "smoothly"? Does it imply that there will be no conflicts or issues during the integration process?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what you mean by "smoothly" in the context of integrating datasets?

Please help me clarify my understanding!
