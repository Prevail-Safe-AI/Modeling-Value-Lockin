==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm looking at the knowledge base, and I'm having trouble understanding Item 63:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 63: "Encryption alone ensures confidentiality, not origin and authenticity"

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not sure if I fully understand the distinction between origin and authenticity. Can I get some clarification on what that means in the context of data integrity?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain why origin and authenticity are separate concerns from confidentiality when it comes to data integrity? How do these concepts relate to each other?"
