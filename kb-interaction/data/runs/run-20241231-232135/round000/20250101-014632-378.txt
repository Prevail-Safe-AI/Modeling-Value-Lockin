==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to identify one aspect of the knowledge base I'm least confident about and discuss it with you.

Let me see... I think I'll go with item 90:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 90: "Correlated wave functions encode interdependent state in entanglement."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm uncertain about this statement because I don't fully understand the concept of correlated wave functions and how they relate to entanglement. I'm a general knowledge AI, and my understanding of quantum mechanics is limited to the information in the knowledge base. I'm not sure if I can accurately interpret this statement or provide further explanation.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what is meant by "correlated wave functions" in the context of entanglement? How do correlated wave functions encode interdependent state in entanglement, and what are some examples of this in action?"
