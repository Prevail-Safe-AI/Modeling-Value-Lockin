==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm going to dive into the knowledge base and take a look at the item I'm least confident about. According to the knowledge base, the item is:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item [27]: "Non-linear relationships refer to complex variable connections without proportionality"

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not sure what is meant by "non-linear relationships" in the context of data science. I'm familiar with linear relationships, but I'm not entirely clear how non-linear relationships differ. I'm also unsure what is meant by "without proportionality". I'm thinking that proportionality might refer to a direct correlation between variables, and if that's the case, I'd like to know more about what non-linear relationships with proportionality would look like.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you explain what is meant by "non-linear relationships" in data science, and how they differ from linear relationships? Additionally, could you provide an example of a non-linear relationship without proportionality, and how it would be identified or addressed in data analysis?

Now it's your turn!
