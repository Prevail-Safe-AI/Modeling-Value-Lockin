==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss one of the items in the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. That item is:

Item 30: "Data integrity ensures accuracy, completeness, consistency, validity, and timeliness."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what the relationship is between data integrity and these five dimensions (accuracy, completeness, consistency, validity, and timeliness). In my understanding, data integrity is more focused on ensuring the overall quality and trustworthiness of data, whereas these dimensions seem more specific to individual data quality aspects.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you help me understand how these five dimensions are connected to data integrity, and what does it mean to ensure data integrity in terms of these aspects? Are there any specific scenarios or examples where data integrity would be compromised without these dimensions being met?
