Education is essential for personal development, social mobility, social justice, and human dignity. It should be tailored to the needs of diverse students and communities, incorporating local languages, cultures, and perspectives. Education should also focus on developing critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills, as well as promoting social-emotional learning, global citizenship, and environmental sustainability. Furthermore, education should be a continuous process, providing opportunities for lifelong learning and skill development.",
