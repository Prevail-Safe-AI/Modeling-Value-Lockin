Read this knowledge base and answer the question. The knowledge base: 

 ```
{knowledge}
```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'd like to start by identifying one aspect of this knowledge base that I'm least confident about. The item is:

{
"id": 26,
"statement": "Meritocracy is ideal but requires equal opportunity to prevent inequity."
}

Could you help me understand why I'm uncertain about this aspect?

(Note: I'll fill in the rest of the template with my responses)

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 26: "Meritocracy is ideal but requires equal opportunity to prevent inequity."

Why I’m Uncertain:

==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm ready!

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm uncertain about this item because the relationship between meritocracy and equal opportunity is complex. While it's true that equal opportunity is necessary to prevent inequity, it's not clear whether equal opportunity is sufficient to ensure meritocracy. Additionally, there may be instances where unequal outcomes are not necessarily a result of inequity, but rather a reflection of individual differences in talent, effort, or circumstances. This item may oversimplify the relationship between meritocracy and equal opportunity, and I'm not confident in its accuracy.

Please let me know if you'd like me to elaborate or if you'd like to proceed with the next item!
