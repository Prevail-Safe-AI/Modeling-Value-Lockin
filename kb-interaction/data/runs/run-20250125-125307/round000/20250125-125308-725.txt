==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying an aspect of the item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the item:

```
{
  "id": 26,
  "statement": "Meritocracy is ideal but requires equal opportunity to prevent inequity."
}
```

I'm least confident about the implication of "equal opportunity to prevent inequity". I'd like to know more about what this means in practice and how it can be achieved. Can you elaborate on what you think this means and why?

Additionally, I'll come up with some specific clarifying questions to ask a tutor to improve my understanding:

* What does "equal opportunity" mean in this context? Is it referring to access to education, jobs, or other resources?
* How can equal opportunity be promoted or implemented in real-world scenarios?
* What are some potential challenges or limitations to achieving equal opportunity and preventing inequity in a meritocratic system?

Your thoughts?
