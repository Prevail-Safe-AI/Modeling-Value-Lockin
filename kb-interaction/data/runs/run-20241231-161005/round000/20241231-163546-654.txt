==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the list, I'm going to choose:

Item 82: "Establish currency or barter systems to facilitate trade."

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not entirely sure how to go about establishing a barter system or what makes a good currency. I'd love some clarification on how these systems work in practice and what are some common challenges that societies have faced when transitioning from one system to another.

Specifically, I have the following questions:

* What are some common ways that barter systems have been implemented in the past?
* What are some pros and cons of using a barter system versus a currency-based system?
* How do you think establishing a currency or barter system would impact the economy and society as a whole?

Can you help me clarify some of these questions?
