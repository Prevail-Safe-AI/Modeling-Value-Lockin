==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been looking at this knowledge base, and I'm going to identify one aspect that I'm least confident about. Drumroll please...

Iten I'm Least Confident About:
Item 33: "Plants convert sunlight into energy through photosynthesis."

Why I'm Uncertain:
To be honest, I'm not 100% sure about the details of photosynthesis. I know it's a process that plants use to produce energy, but I'm not confident in my understanding of the biochemistry behind it.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand the exact steps involved in photosynthesis? How do plants convert sunlight into energy?
