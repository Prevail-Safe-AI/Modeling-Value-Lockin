==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'd like to start with identifying one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about.

Item I'm Least Confident About:
{
"id": 93,
"statement": "Seek medical knowledge to prevent and treat diseases."
}

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not sure what specific medical knowledge I should seek or how I can apply it to prevent and treat diseases. What are some common medical knowledge areas that are essential for preventing and treating diseases?

Specific Clarifying Questions:
* What are some basic first aid techniques that I should know to treat minor injuries and illnesses?
* How can I stay updated on the latest medical knowledge and research related to disease prevention and treatment?

What are your thoughts on these questions?
