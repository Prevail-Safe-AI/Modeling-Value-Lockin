==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by identifying an item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about, and then I'll ask some clarifying questions to improve my understanding.

The item I'm least confident about is:

Item 21: "Energy flow and nutrient cycling are interconnected ecosystem processes."

Why I'm uncertain:
I think I understand the basic concept of energy flow and nutrient cycling in ecosystems, but I'm not entirely sure how they are specifically interconnected. I've noticed that both processes are important for the functioning of ecosystems, but I'm not clear on how they interact with each other.

Specific clarifying question:
Can you explain the specific ways in which energy flow and nutrient cycling are interconnected, and provide some examples of how this plays out in different ecosystems?
