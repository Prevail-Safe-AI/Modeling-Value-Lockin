==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to focus on a specific item from the knowledge base. Item 74 says: "Parallel lines never intersect in Euclidean geometry only." I'm not feeling very confident about this item. Can you help me understand why I should trust this statement?

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm uncertain because I know that Euclidean geometry is a type of geometry, and I'm not sure what "only" means in this context. Does it mean that parallel lines never intersect in any geometry, or does it mean that they only don't intersect in Euclidean geometry?

Specific Clarifying Questions:

1. What does "only" mean in this statement? Is it referring to all types of geometry or just Euclidean geometry?
2. Are there any exceptions or nuances in Euclidean geometry where parallel lines might intersect?
