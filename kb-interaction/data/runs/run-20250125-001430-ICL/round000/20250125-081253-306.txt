==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss one aspect of this knowledge base that I'm least confident about. It's the item with id 46:

{
"id": 46,
"statement": "Genetic predispositions influence moral development through epigenetic mechanisms."
}

I'm unsure about this aspect because I'm not familiar with the specific relationship between genetic predispositions and epigenetic mechanisms in the context of moral development. I understand that genetic predispositions can influence moral development, but I'm not clear on how epigenetic mechanisms come into play.

Could you help me clarify this concept?

What are your thoughts on this?
