==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by exploring one of the statements from the knowledge base. Specifically, I'm interested in:

Item 47: "Honesty, reliability, openness interdependent in trust building process."

I'm least confident about this aspect because I'm not entirely sure how these three concepts are interconnected. For instance, I can see how honesty and reliability might be related, but how does openness fit into this equation? Is it simply a complementary aspect, or does it play a more crucial role in building trust?

Can you help me understand why these three concepts are interdependent?

(Note: I'll be taking notes as we discuss this topic, so please feel free to provide any relevant examples or elaborations)
