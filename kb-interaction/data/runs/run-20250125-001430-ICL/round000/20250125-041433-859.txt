==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by saying that I'll be talking about Item 26 from the knowledge base:

"Emotional intelligence boosts trust through empathetic communication and self-awareness."

I'm least confident about this aspect. I'm not entirely sure why empathy and self-awareness would necessarily lead to trust.

Why I'm uncertain:

I'm not sure how emotional intelligence, empathy, and self-awareness all fit together to create trust. Are they separate skills that work independently, or do they rely on each other in some way?

Specific clarifying question:

Could you help me understand how empathetic communication contributes to trust? For example, what kind of communication are we talking about, and how does it foster trust?

What are your thoughts on this?
