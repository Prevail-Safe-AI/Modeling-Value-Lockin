==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Based on the knowledge base, I've noticed that there are many statements about the relationship between epigenetics, genetic, environmental, and cultural factors on honesty and moral judgments. 

I'd like to discuss item 85:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 85: "Moral judgments shaped by complex interactions of genetic, environmental, and cultural factors."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure how these complex interactions occur and how they shape moral judgments. For example, I'm unclear about the exact mechanisms by which genetics, environment, and culture influence moral decision-making.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain how these factors interact with each other to shape moral judgments, and are there any known examples or studies that demonstrate this complex interaction?
