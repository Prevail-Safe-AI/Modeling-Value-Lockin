==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Based on the knowledge base, I'd like to identify one aspect that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the statements, I've chosen item 79:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 79: "Moral judgments of lying influenced by situational complexity."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm unsure about this statement because it seems to imply that moral judgments of lying are based solely on the situation, and I'm not convinced that situational complexity is the only factor that influences moral judgments. I'm wondering if there are other factors that play a more significant role.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand how situational complexity impacts moral judgments of lying? For example, are there certain types of situations where moral judgments are more nuanced or context-dependent, and if so, how do they influence our judgment of lying?
