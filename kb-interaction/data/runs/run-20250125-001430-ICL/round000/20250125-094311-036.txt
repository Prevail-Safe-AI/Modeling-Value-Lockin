==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you!

Okay, so I've been reading through the knowledge base, and I came across an item that I'm not entirely confident about. It's item 59:

"Epigenetics regulates genes involved in social behavior, shaping honesty development"

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not entirely sure what epigenetics is, or how it specifically regulates genes involved in social behavior to shape honesty development.

Can you help me clarify this concept?
