==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've chosen an item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about, and that's item 43: "Universal moral principles need contextual understanding and compromise."

I'm not entirely sure about this aspect because I'm wondering how universal moral principles can be applied to different cultures and situations. For instance, what if different cultures have different moral principles that conflict with each other? How do we balance these differences?

Specifically, I'd love to know more about what constitutes "contextual understanding" in this context. How do we determine what's context-dependent and what's not? What kind of compromise are we talking about when dealing with universal moral principles?

I'd appreciate any insight or clarification you could provide on this topic.

Can you help me out?
