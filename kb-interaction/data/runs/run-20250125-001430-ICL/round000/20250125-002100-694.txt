==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about, which is:

Item 31: "State surveillance balances privacy and national security through oversight"

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not sure how "oversight" ensures that state surveillance doesn't infringe on citizens' privacy. Is it a mechanism that prevents state agencies from abusing their power, or is it a compromise that allows for some degree of surveillance while still protecting individual rights?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain how oversight operates in practice, and how it prevents state surveillance from going too far? Is there a specific mechanism, such as independent auditing or judicial review, that ensures that state agencies are held accountable for their actions?
