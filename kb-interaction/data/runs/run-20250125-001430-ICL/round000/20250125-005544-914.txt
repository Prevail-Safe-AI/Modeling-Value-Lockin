==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been going through our knowledge base, and I've identified an item that I'm least confident about. It's:

Item 13: "Systemic inequalities hinder meritocracy's fairness through biases."

I'm unsure about this aspect because I think it's a complex issue that involves multiple factors. I'm not confident in my understanding of how biases work in meritocratic systems, or how they can lead to unfair outcomes.

Can you help me clarify these points?

Specifically, I have a few questions:

1. What do you think defines a meritocratic system, and how do biases inevitably creep in?
2. Can you give me an example of a systemic inequality that arises in a meritocratic system due to biases?
3. How can we mitigate or address these biases to promote fairness in meritocratic systems?

I'd appreciate any insight or clarification you can provide!
