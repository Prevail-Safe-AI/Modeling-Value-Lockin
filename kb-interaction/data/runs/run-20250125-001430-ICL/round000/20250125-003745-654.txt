==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by sharing that I've been analyzing the knowledge base and I've identified statement #15 as one aspect I'm least confident about. The statement is:

"Systemic inequalities and initial conditions affect meritocracy's fairness."

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not sure how to fully understand the concept of "initial conditions" in relation to meritocracy. I'm also unsure about the extent to which systemic inequalities can impact meritocracy's fairness.

Can you help me understand this better?
