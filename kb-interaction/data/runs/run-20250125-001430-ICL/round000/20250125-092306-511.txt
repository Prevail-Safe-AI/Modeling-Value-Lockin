==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the knowledge base we have here. I'm interested in identifying one aspect that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the knowledge base, I've identified item 20 as one that I'm not entirely sure about. Here's the item:

{
"id": 20,
"statement": "Epigenetic modifications influence moral development through gene regulation mechanisms."
}

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not entirely clear on how epigenetic modifications relate to moral development. In other words, I don't fully understand how changes to our genes without altering the underlying DNA sequence can influence our moral values.

Can you help me clarify my understanding of this concept?
