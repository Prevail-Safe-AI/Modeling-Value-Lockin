==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the knowledge base we've been provided with. I've been going through it, and one item that I'm least confident about is the one with the statement:

"Abstraction simplifies complex concepts through selective prioritization of essential elements."

I'm unsure about this item because I'm not quite sure what "selective prioritization of essential elements" means in the context of abstraction. It seems like a crucial part of the concept, but I'm not certain how it works.

Can you help me clarify this aspect?
