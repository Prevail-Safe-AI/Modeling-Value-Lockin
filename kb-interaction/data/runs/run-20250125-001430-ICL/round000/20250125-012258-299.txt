==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss one of the statements in the knowledge base, specifically item 86: "Gravity acceleration influenced by Earth's shape and mass, slightly."

I'm not very confident about this aspect, and I'd like to know more about why it's mentioned as "slightly" influenced by Earth's shape and mass. Can you help me understand what's meant by that? Maybe we can clarify it together.

What's your take on this? Are you also uncertain about this statement, or do you have any insights to share?
