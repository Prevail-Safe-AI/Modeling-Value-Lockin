==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been reviewing our knowledge base, and I've come across an item that I'm least confident about. It's:

Item 62: "Genetic, environmental, and cultural factors interact to shape moral judgments."

I'm unsure about this aspect because it's quite general and doesn't provide much specific information about the interaction between these factors. How do these factors actually interact to shape moral judgments? Is it a one-way interaction, or is it more complex?

Can you help me clarify this by answering some specific questions?
