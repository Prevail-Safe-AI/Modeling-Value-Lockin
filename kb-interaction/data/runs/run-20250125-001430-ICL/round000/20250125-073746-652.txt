==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item #38 from the knowledge base:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 38: "Epigenetic changes regulate honesty development through complex mechanisms"

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm uncertain about the specific "complex mechanisms" by which epigenetic changes regulate honesty development. I understand that epigenetic changes can affect gene expression, but I'd like to know more about how this relates to honesty development. I'm not sure if it's a direct cause-and-effect relationship or if there are other factors at play.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain how epigenetic changes (e.g. DNA methylation, histone modification) directly or indirectly influence honesty development, and what role other biological, personal, and cultural factors might play in this process?
