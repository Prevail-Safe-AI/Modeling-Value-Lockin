==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to explore the knowledge base we've been given. Specifically, I'm going to identify one aspect of this item that I'm least confident about, and then we can discuss it further.

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 10: "Power imbalance affects trust through respect, communication, and empathy."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not sure how effective the combination of respect, communication, and empathy is in mitigating the impact of power imbalance on trust. Are these variables necessarily sufficient and necessary conditions for addressing power imbalance in trust-building contexts?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can a power imbalance still affect trust even if respect, communication, and empathy are present, but not equally distributed?
