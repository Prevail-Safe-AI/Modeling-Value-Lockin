==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to explore a specific item from the knowledge base. Let's take item 41, for example: "Moral judgment influenced by intentions, consequences, and character traits."

I'm the least confident about this aspect. I'd like to know why I'm uncertain about that:

Why I'm Uncertain:

* I'm unsure about how intentions, consequences, and character traits interact with each other to influence moral judgment. Do they work independently, or do they have a synergistic effect?

Specific Clarifying Question:

* Can you provide more insight on how these three factors combine to shape moral judgment? For instance, does the intention behind an action have a stronger impact than the consequences, or is it the other way around?
