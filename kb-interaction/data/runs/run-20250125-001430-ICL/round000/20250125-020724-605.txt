==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into this knowledge base together. I've chosen an item from the list that I'm least confident about, and I'd love to discuss it with you. Here it is:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 68: "Moral realism contests the idea of moral subjectivism."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what moral realism is or what moral subjectivism is, and I'm unsure how they relate to each other. I'm also curious about what kind of debates or arguments might arise from this statement.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you explain what moral realism and moral subjectivism are, and how they relate to each other?
