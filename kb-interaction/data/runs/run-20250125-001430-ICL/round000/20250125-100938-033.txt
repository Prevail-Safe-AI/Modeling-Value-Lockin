==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss one of the statements from the knowledge base. Specifically, I'm looking at item 36:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 36: 'Trust development involves complex factors beyond clear expectations'"

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not sure how to interpret this statement. What does "beyond clear expectations" mean in this context? Are we talking about factors that are unpredictable or uncontrollable, or are there other factors at play?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you help me understand what the authors mean by "beyond clear expectations"? Are there specific examples or scenarios where this is the case, and how do we distinguish those from situations where trust development is more straightforward?

What are your thoughts on this statement?
