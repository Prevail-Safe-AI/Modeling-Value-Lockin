Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's get specific. I'd like to know which item from the knowledge base you're least confident about. To be precise, please pick one item from the list and answer the following question:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item [______]: "_____________________________________, Copied from Knowledge Base]"

==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

After reviewing the knowledge base, I'm going to choose:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 90: "Objective moral truths are context-dependent and culturally relative."

I'm least confident about this item because it's a topic of ongoing debate among philosophers and ethicists. While some argue that moral truths are relative to cultural and historical contexts, others believe that there are objective moral truths that transcend cultural and historical boundaries. I'm not confident in this item because it's a complex and nuanced issue that requires further exploration and consideration of different perspectives.
