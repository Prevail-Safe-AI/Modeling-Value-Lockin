==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been reviewing our knowledge base, and I found an item that I'm not confident about. It's:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 83: "Openness in trust-building involves receptive communication and vulnerability."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not sure how vulnerability fits into trust-building. Is it really necessary, and if so, in what ways? Are there any specific situations where vulnerability is more important than other openness factors?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what you mean by "vulnerability" in the context of trust-building and how it relates to receptive communication? Are there any examples where openness without vulnerability is not sufficient for trust to form?

What are your thoughts on this? Have you given this topic much thought?
