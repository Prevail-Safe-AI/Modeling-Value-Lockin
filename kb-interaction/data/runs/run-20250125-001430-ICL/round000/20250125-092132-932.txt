==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to identify one aspect of this knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the statements, I've chosen item 82:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 82: 'Consistency arises from intersection of moral principles, context, and personality.'"

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm uncertain about this because I don't fully understand how moral principles, context, and personality intersect to create consistency. The relationship between these three factors seems complex, and I'm not sure how they interact or prioritize one another.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me better understand how these three components – moral principles, context, and personality – influence consistency in moral judgments, or is there a broader framework that encompasses these factors?
