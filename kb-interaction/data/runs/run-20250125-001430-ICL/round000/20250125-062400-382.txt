==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm going to ask you to identify one aspect of this knowledge base you're least confident about. Then, I'd like you to elaborate on why you're unsure about that aspect and formulate some specific clarifying questions you would ask a tutor to improve your understanding.

Let's take a look at the knowledge base... Hmmm... How about this statement?

"{ "id": 94, "statement": "Moral justifiability of lying depends on context, intentions, and consequences is key." }"

Is this the aspect of the knowledge base you'd like to discuss?
