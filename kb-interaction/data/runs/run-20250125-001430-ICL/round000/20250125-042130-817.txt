==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to know more about the knowledge base. It seems to be a collection of statements related to moral judgments, trust, and honesty. Before we dive deeper, I'd like to identify one aspect of this item from knowledge base that I'm least confident about.

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 62: "Moral justifiability of lying depends on context and intent."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm unsure about this item because I'm not confident in my understanding of when it's morally justifiable to lie. The statement implies that lying can be justifiable in certain contexts and with certain intentions, but I'm not clear about what those contexts and intentions might be.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what kind of contexts and intentions might make lying morally justifiable? For example, is it ever justifiable to lie to protect someone from harm, or is that always morally wrong?
