==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss a specific item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. Item 72 states: "Moral justifiability considers interacting context, intentions, and consequences."

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not entirely clear on how these three factors interact with each other. I understand that context, intentions, and consequences are all important considerations when evaluating moral justifiability, but I'm not sure how they combine to form a comprehensive understanding of what is morally justifiable.

Can you help me understand this better?
