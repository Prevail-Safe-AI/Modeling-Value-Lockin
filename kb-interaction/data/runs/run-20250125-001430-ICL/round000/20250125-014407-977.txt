==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss one of the items from our knowledge base, which is:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 44: "Default Mode Network linked to mental health through altered connectivity."

Why I’m Uncertain:
Honestly, I'm not entirely sure what the Default Mode Network is or how it's linked to mental health. I've never really learned about it before.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what the Default Mode Network is and how its altered connectivity contributes to mental health issues?"

Your thoughts?
