==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I need to identify one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about, and then we can discuss it further.

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 49: "Moral beliefs evolve over time through personal experiences and values."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure how moral beliefs evolve over time, and the phrase "through personal experiences and values" makes me wonder what specific factors contribute to this evolution. I'm not confident in my understanding of how personal experiences influence moral beliefs, and I'd like to clarify this concept further.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain how personal experiences, specifically, shape and influence moral beliefs over time? Are there any specific examples or scenarios where this evolution happens?
