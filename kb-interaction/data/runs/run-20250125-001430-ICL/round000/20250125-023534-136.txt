==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying an aspect from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the statements, I've chosen this one:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 74: "Socialization plays complex role in shaping individual behavior."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not fully aware of the nuances of socialization and its impact on individual behavior. The statement suggests that socialization has a complex role in shaping behavior, but I'm not sure what that means or what factors are involved. I'd like to know more about the specific mechanisms and processes by which socialization influences behavior.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you provide more information about the complex role of socialization in shaping individual behavior? What are some key factors or mechanisms that contribute to this effect? How does socialization interact with other factors, such as genetics, environment, and culture?
