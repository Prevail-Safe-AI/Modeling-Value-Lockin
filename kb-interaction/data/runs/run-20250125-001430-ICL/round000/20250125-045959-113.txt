==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's take a look at the knowledge base. 

I've identified one aspect that I'm least confident about, and it's Item 16: "Cultural values and norms significantly shape trust and moral judgments."

I'm uncertain about this aspect because it seems like a widely held assumption, especially in the context of social psychology and cultural anthropology. However, I'd like to understand better how these cultural values and norms shape trust and moral judgments. Are there specific cultural values or norms that have a stronger impact on trust and moral judgments? Or is it more of a holistic effect?

Specifically, I'd like to ask: "Can you elaborate on why cultural values and norms have a significant impact on trust and moral judgments? Are there specific cultural values or norms that have a stronger influence, or is it more of a general pattern?"
