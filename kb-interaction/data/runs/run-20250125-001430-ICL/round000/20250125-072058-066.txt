==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been asked to analyze a specific item from the knowledge base, and that item is:

Item 92: "Epigenetic changes influence honesty development through gene expression regulation."

I'm supposed to identify an aspect of this item that I'm least confident about, elaborate on why I'm uncertain, and then formulate specific clarifying questions to improve my understanding.

Let's get started! Can you help me with this task?
