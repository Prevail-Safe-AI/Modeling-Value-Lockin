==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been tasked with identifying an aspect from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about and elaborating why I'm uncertain. I've chosen item 8:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 8: "Honesty, reliability, and openness interdependent in trust building."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure why these three aspects are specifically mentioned as interdependent in building trust. While I understand that honesty and reliability are important components of trust, I'm not clear on why openness is also mentioned as a crucial factor. Are there specific situations or scenarios where openness is particularly important for building trust, or is it a general principle that applies across all types of trust-building situations?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain why openness is included as a key component of trust building alongside honesty and reliability? What are some specific examples or contexts where openness is particularly important for building trust?
