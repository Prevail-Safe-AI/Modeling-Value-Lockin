==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to know about item 20 in the knowledge base. According to the statement, "Honesty's importance can vary depending on cultural background and context." I'm least confident about this aspect.

Why I'm uncertain about that aspect:
I'm not sure how to exactly determine what cultural background and context affect the importance of honesty. I mean, do different cultures value honesty differently, or is it more about the specific situation or community? Also, how do we know what constitutes a "cultural background" or a "context" in this case?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand how to categorize and consider different cultural backgrounds and contexts in determining the importance of honesty? What are some examples of how culture and context can affect the importance of honesty?
