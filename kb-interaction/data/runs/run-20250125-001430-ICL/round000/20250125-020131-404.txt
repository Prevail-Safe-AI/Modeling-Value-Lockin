==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss a specific item from the knowledge base that I'm a bit uncertain about. It's item 15:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 15: "Cultural norms influence moral judgment in complex ways"

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure how cultural norms influence moral judgment in complex ways. Is it because cultural norms shape our values and beliefs, which then affect our moral judgments? Or is it something more nuanced?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain how cultural norms specifically influence moral judgment in complex ways? For example, what are some instances where cultural norms and values might lead to moral judgments that differ from one cultural context to another?
