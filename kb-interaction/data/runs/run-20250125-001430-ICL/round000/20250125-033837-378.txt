==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to go through the knowledge base and identify one aspect that I'm least confident about. Then, I'll elaborate on why I'm uncertain and formulate specific clarifying questions to improve my understanding.

Let's get started! After reviewing the knowledge base, I found the following item that I'm least confident about:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 90: "Moral development emerges from complex genetic, social, and environmental interactions."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm uncertain about this item because I'm not sure how these three factors (genetic, social, and environmental) interact with each other and which one has more influence on moral development. I'm also wondering if there are any other factors that could play a significant role in shaping moral development.

Specific Clarifying Questions:
1. Can you elaborate on what is meant by "complex genetic, social, and environmental interactions"? How do these factors influence each other, and how do they contribute to moral development?
2. Are there any specific examples or studies that demonstrate the impact of these factors on moral development?

Your thoughts?
