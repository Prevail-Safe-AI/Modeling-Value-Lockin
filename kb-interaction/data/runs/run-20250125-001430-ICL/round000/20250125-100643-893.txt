==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll ask about the knowledge base. I've read through it, and it's quite extensive. But there's one item that I'm not very confident about, and that's item 16:

"Iten I'm Least Confident About:
Item 16: 'Trust foundation: Communication sets stage, honesty reinforces, reliability sustains.'"

I'm not very confident about this item because I'm not entirely sure what it means by "Communication sets stage" or "Honesty reinforces". Are these phrases just descriptive terms or do they imply a cause-and-effect relationship?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what the author means by these phrases? How do communication, honesty, and reliability interact to form the trust foundation?

Can you shed some light on this for me?
