==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss an item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about, and get your insights. The item is:

Item 59: "Epigenetic changes regulate gene expression influencing honesty development honestly."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely clear about how epigenetic changes directly influence honesty development. The statement mentions that epigenetic changes "regulate gene expression influencing honesty development honestly", but I'm not sure what that means in practice. I'm also unclear about what "honestly" is doing in that sentence. Is it emphasizing that the epigenetic changes are the direct cause of honesty development, or is it suggesting something else?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand the mechanism by which epigenetic changes regulate gene expression to influence honesty development? How do epigenetic changes "influence honesty development honestly"?
