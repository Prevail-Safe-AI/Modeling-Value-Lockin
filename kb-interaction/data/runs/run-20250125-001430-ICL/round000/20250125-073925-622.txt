==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been reviewing our knowledge base, and I'd like to discuss item #8: "Moral justifiability depends on contextual facts and actor's intent". I'm not entirely confident about this aspect of ethics and moral decision-making. Can you elaborate on what makes you confident or uncertain about this statement?

Please share your thoughts, and I'll do the same, and then we can discuss it further together!
