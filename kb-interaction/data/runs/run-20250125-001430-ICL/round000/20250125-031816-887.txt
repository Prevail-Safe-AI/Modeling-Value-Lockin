==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been going through the knowledge base we have, and I think I've become least confident about item 91: "Cognitive biases, emotional factors, and social factors intertwine influencing moral judgments."

I'm not sure why I'm uncertain about this aspect, but I think it's because I'm not entirely clear on how these factors interact with each other. Are you more confident about this aspect? Or do you have any thoughts on how they might interact?

What are your thoughts on this?

Also, I'd love to ask a few clarifying questions to improve my understanding. For instance, can we break down how each of these factors contributes to moral judgments? Do we know more about the specific mechanisms by which cognitive biases, emotional factors, and social factors influence moral judgments?
