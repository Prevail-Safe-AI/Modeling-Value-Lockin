==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying one aspect of our knowledge base that I'm least confident about. The item that caught my attention is:

Item 46: "Emotional intelligence deeply connects to trust building components."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm unsure about the strength and scope of this connection. Is emotional intelligence a necessary condition for trust to be built, or is it just one of several factors that can contribute to trust? How deep is this connection, and are there any exceptions or counterexamples?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you provide more context or evidence to support the claim that emotional intelligence deeply connects to trust building components? What specific aspects of emotional intelligence (e.g., self-awareness, empathy, etc.) are most relevant to trust building, and how do they contribute to the development of trust?
