==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been analyzing our knowledge base, and I've come across an item that has caught my attention. It's item 29, which states: "Reliability exists independently of honesty in tasks, not values."

I have to admit, I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect. It seems to suggest that reliability and honesty are distinct concepts, but only when it comes to tasks, not values. Can you elaborate on why you think reliability operates independently of honesty in this way?
