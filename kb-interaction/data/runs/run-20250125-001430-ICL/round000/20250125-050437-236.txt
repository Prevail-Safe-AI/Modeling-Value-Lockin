==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

According to our knowledge base, I'd like to identify one aspect of this item from knowledge base that I'm least confident about:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 9: "Trust formation involves complex psychological-social-cultural interactions."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure how these interactions work together to form trust. Are there any specific psychological, social, or cultural factors that play a more significant role in trust formation?

Specific Clarifying Question:
What are the key psychological, social, and cultural factors that contribute to trust formation, and how do they interact with each other in this process?
