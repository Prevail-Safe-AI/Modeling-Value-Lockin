==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's get started!

I've been tasked with identifying one aspect of a knowledge base item that I'm least confident about. The item is:

{
"id": 54,
"statement": "Lying's moral justifiability depends on context, motives, and consequences."
}

I'm going to present it, and then ask you to help me go over it.

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 54: "Lying's moral justifiability depends on context, motives, and consequences."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not sure if the statement is true or false. I understand that lying can be justifiable in certain situations, but I'm not convinced that context, motives, and consequences are the only factors that determine its moral justifiability.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand how context, motives, and consequences can be the sole determinants of whether lying is morally justifiable or not? Are there other factors that might be at play as well?

What are your thoughts on this?
