==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been going through the knowledge base, and I've identified one aspect that I'm least confident about: Item 61.

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 61: 'Moral judgments adapt through reflection, social influence, and shared experiences.'"

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not sure how these three factors - reflection, social influence, and shared experiences - actually influence moral judgments. It seems like a straightforward statement, but I'm not entirely convinced about the details of how it works.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand how reflection, social influence, and shared experiences actually contribute to the adaptation of moral judgments? Is one factor more significant than the others? How do these factors interact with each other in shaping our moral judgments?

What are your thoughts on this?
