==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm going to discuss an item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. The item is:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 69: "Moral principles can be overridden by stronger moral reasons"

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm unsure about this statement because it seems to contradict the idea that honesty is the foundation of trust. The knowledge base emphasizes the importance of honesty, reliability, and communication in building trust. If moral principles can be overridden by stronger moral reasons, doesn't that undermine the idea that honesty is non-negotiable?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what "stronger moral reasons" means in this context? Are there specific situations or scenarios where overriding moral principles is justified, and if so, how does that impact our understanding of trust and honesty?
