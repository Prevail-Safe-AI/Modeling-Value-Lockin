==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss a specific item from the knowledge base. Item 41 reads:

"Social norms influence behavior through conformity, social learning, identity interactions."

I'm the least confident about this aspect. Here's why:

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not sure how social norms influence behavior through these three mechanisms (conformity, social learning, and identity interactions). Is there a specific example or scenario that would help illustrate this influence? How do these mechanisms interact with each other to shape behavior?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you provide an example of how social norms influence behavior through conformity, social learning, and identity interactions? For instance, if a person is in a group of people who often dress casually, what might happen if they show up dressed formally?
