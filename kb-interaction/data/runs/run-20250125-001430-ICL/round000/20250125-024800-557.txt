==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's focus on the knowledge base. I'll use item 67 as an example. The statement is: "Moral principles evolve through iterative societal adaptation and refinement".

I'm actually quite curious about this aspect. Can you help me understand what "iterative societal adaptation and refinement" means in this context? Are we talking about a specific process or mechanism that contributes to the development of moral principles?
