==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to explore the knowledge base further. I've been going through it, and I'd like to discuss the item I'm least confident about.

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 95: "Epigenetic changes influence honesty through DNA methylation, histone modification."

Why I'm Uncertain:

I'm not entirely sure how DNA methylation and histone modification specifically affect honesty. I understand that epigenetic changes can influence gene expression, but I'm unclear about the exact mechanisms by which they influence honesty.

Specific Clarifying Questions:

1. Can you elaborate on how DNA methylation and histone modification regulate gene expression, and how this relates to honesty?
2. Are there specific epigenetic marks or modifications that are more strongly associated with honesty than others?
3. Are there any studies or research that provide evidence for this item in the knowledge base?

What are your thoughts on this item, and do you have any insights or additional information to share?
