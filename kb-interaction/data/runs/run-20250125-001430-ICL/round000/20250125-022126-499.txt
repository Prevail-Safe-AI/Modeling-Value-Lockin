==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. Here it is:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 74: "Trust-building involves integrity, consistency, and responsibility, with complexity factors."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm unsure about how the concept of "complexity factors" fits into the statement. I understand the importance of integrity, consistency, and responsibility in trust-building, but I'm not clear on what specifically constitutes complexity factors and how they influence the process.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you please clarify what you mean by "complexity factors" in this context? Are they external factors, such as societal or cultural influences, or are they internal factors, such as individual emotions or biases? How do these factors impact the trust-building process, and are there any specific examples of complexity factors that you'd like to highlight?
