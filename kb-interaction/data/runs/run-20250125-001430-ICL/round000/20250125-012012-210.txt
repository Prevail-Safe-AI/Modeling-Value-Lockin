==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll share my task with you. According to the knowledge base, I'm asked to identify one aspect of this item that I'm least confident about:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 27: "Lying's morality depends on context, intentions, and consequences."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm uncertain about this aspect because I feel like it oversimplifies the complexity of moral judgments. I'm not sure if lying is always wrong or if there are certain situations where it might be morally justified.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand how the moral justifiability of lying is actually influenced by these three factors: context, intentions, and consequences? Are there any specific scenarios or examples where one or more of these factors might take precedence over the others?

Now it's your turn!
