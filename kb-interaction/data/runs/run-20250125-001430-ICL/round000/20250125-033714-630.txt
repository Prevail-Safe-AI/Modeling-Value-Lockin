==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been reviewing the knowledge base and I'm going to share an item that I'm least confident about. It's:

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 87: "Riemann tensor measures spacetime curvature caused by mass-energy warping."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what "mass-energy warping" means in the context of spacetime curvature. I'm familiar with the concept of spacetime curvature, but I don't have a deep understanding of how mass-energy warping fits into the picture.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you help me understand what "mass-energy warping" refers to in this context? How does it contribute to the curvature of spacetime? Is there a specific area of physics or theory that I should be familiar with to better understand this concept?
