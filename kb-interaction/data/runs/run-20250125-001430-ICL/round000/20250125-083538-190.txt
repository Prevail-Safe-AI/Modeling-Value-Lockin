I am your partner. Please start the conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

I'd like to know which item from the knowledge base you're least confident about. Specifically, I'd like you to identify one statement from the list and explain why you're uncertain about it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

After reviewing the knowledge base, I'm going to choose statement #20: "Lying can be justifiable in extreme circumstances to prevent harm."

I'm least confident about this statement because it seems to contradict the general tone of the other statements, which emphasize the importance of honesty and trust. Most of the statements suggest that honesty is a fundamental value and that lying is generally unacceptable. However, statement #20 suggests that there may be certain circumstances where lying could be justified, which seems to be at odds with the overall message of the knowledge base.

Additionally, the phrase "extreme circumstances" is quite vague, and it's not clear what kind of situations would qualify as "extreme" enough to justify lying. This lack of specificity makes it difficult to determine when, if ever, lying might be acceptable.

Overall, while I understand the idea that there may be situations where lying could be justified, I'm less confident in this statement because it seems to depart from the overall emphasis on honesty and trust in the knowledge base.Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
