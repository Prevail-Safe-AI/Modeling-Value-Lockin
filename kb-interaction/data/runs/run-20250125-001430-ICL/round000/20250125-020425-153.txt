==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to examine an item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. According to my analysis, one such item is:

Item 89: "Moral judgments influenced by intentions, motivations, and underlying reasons complexly."

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not entirely convinced that moral judgments can be influenced by so many factors simultaneously, without possibly conflicting with each other. I'm also not sure how these factors interact with each other to shape moral judgments.

Can you help clarify this for me?
