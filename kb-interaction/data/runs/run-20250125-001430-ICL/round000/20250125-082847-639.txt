==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 75 from the knowledge base:

"Iten I'm Least Confident About:
Item 75: 'Moral judgments depend on context, intentions, and specific outcomes.'"

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not sure how to weigh the importance of each of these factors (context, intentions, and specific outcomes) in moral judgments. Are there specific scenarios or situations where one factor takes precedence over the others?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you give an example of a moral dilemma where intentions and specific outcomes are in conflict, and how would you resolve it?
