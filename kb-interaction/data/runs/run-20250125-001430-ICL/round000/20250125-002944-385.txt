==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Exciting!

I'd like to start by identifying one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the statements, I've chosen item 79:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 79: "Lying's moral justification remains a subject of ongoing debate."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not sure what constitutes an "ongoing debate" or what specific factors contribute to the moral complexity of lying. I'd like to better understand the nuances of this concept and how it relates to various moral frameworks.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what specific aspects of lying are being debated, and what are the common arguments for and against justifying lying in certain situations?"

Please let me know your thoughts!
