==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been looking at our knowledge base, and I'd like to identify one aspect that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the statements, I've chosen one that stands out to me as something that I'm not entirely sure about.

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 66: "Honesty may not always be morally justifiable in certain contexts."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure about this statement because it seems to suggest that honesty isn't always the right choice, which goes against the idea that honesty is the foundation of trust and morality. I'm curious to know more about what specific contexts might make honesty morally unjustifiable.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what kind of contexts might make honesty morally unjustifiable, and how those situations would justify departing from the standard moral guideline of always being honest?
