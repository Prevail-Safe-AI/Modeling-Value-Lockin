==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to identify one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the items, I've chosen the following one:

Iten I'm Least Confident About:
Item 97: "Epigenetic modifications regulate gene expression through chromatin structure and transcription factor binding."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm unsure about the exact mechanisms by which epigenetic modifications influence chromatin structure and transcription factor binding, leading to changes in gene expression. There seems to be a complex interplay between these factors, and I'd like to understand it better.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain the process of how epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, affect chromatin structure and transcription factor binding, and ultimately influence gene expression? Are there any specific examples or research studies that illustrate this relationship?
