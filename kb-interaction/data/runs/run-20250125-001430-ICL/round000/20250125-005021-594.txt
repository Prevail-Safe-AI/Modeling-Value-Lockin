==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been analyzing the knowledge base, and one item that caught my attention is:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 87: "Inherent dignity is context-dependent, balancing competing values, debated."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what is meant by "inherent dignity" and how it relates to the concept of dignity. I'm also unsure what is meant by "balancing competing values" in the context of dignity. The term "debated" makes me wonder what are the opposing views on this topic.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what inherent dignity refers to in this context? How does this concept relate to dignity in general?
