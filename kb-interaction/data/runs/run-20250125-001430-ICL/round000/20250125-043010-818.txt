==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Excited to dive into this topic!

I'd like to discuss Item 77: "Honesty, openness, and reliability interdependent components of trust foundation".

My least confident aspect about this item is: I'm not entirely sure what "interdependent components" means in this context. Can you elaborate on what's meant by "interdependence" between honesty, openness, and reliability?

Also, I'd love to understand how these three components specifically contribute to the trust foundation. Can you provide more insight into that?
