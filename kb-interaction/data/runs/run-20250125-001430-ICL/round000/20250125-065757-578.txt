==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Based on the knowledge base, I've identified one aspect that I'm least confident about, which is:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 39: "Trust building involves implicit social norms and cultural rules."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm uncertain about this item because I'm not entirely sure how implicit social norms and cultural rules play a direct role in trust building. For example, are these norms and rules only applicable in certain cultural contexts, or are they universally applicable? Additionally, how exactly do these norms and rules influence trust building, and what are some specific examples of this in action?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you provide more insight into how implicit social norms and cultural rules impact trust building, and are there any studies or cases that demonstrate this in practice?
