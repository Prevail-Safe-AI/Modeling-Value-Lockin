==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to know what you've learned from this knowledge base related to moral judgments and trust. Specifically, I'm interested in Item 50: "Cognitive biases intricately interact influencing moral judgments complexity"

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 50: "Cognitive biases intricately interact influencing moral judgments complexity"

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not sure how cognitive biases interact intricately to influence moral judgments. I understand that cognitive biases can influence moral judgments, but I'm unsure about the intricacies of this process.

Specific Clarifying Question:
How do cognitive biases, such as confirmation bias or the availability heuristic, interact with each other and with emotions, cognition, and social factors to shape moral judgments? Can you provide any examples or further clarification on this topic?

What are your thoughts on this? Have you learned anything from the knowledge base that sheds light on this topic?
