==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss one of the items from our knowledge base. Let me choose one... Ah, here it is:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 84: "Epigenetic changes influence honesty development through gene regulation and environment."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure about the relationship between epigenetic changes, gene regulation, and the environment in the context of honesty development. I understand the concept of epigenetics and how it can affect gene expression, but I'm not clear on how this specifically relates to the development of honesty.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain, in simpler terms, how epigenetic changes can influence honesty development through gene regulation and environmental factors? What are some specific mechanisms by which this occurs?

What are your thoughts on this item?
