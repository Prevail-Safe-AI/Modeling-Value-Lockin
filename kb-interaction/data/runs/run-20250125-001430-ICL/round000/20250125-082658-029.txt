Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

I've been reviewing the knowledge base we have, and one aspect that caught my attention is statement 36:

"Trust development requires consistent verbal and nonverbal congruence"

I'm not very confident about this aspect. Can you help me understand why this is the case? What do you think about the claim that congruence between verbal and nonverbal communication is essential for trust development?

(By the way, I'll be asking follow-up questions based on your response!)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Statement 36 highlights the importance of consistency between verbal and nonverbal communication in building trust. This idea is rooted in the concept of social cognition, which suggests that people tend to form impressions of others based on the congruence between their words and actions.

When our verbal and nonverbal cues are in sync, it creates a sense of authenticity and reliability, which are essential components of trust. For instance, if someone says they're going to meet you at 2 PM, but they're late and apologize profusely, the congruence between their verbal promise and nonverbal behavior (e.g., their apology and body language) can help build trust.

On the other hand, when there's a mismatch between verbal and nonverbal communication, it can create confusion, mistrust, or even deception. For example, if someone says they're a trustworthy person but then engages in dishonest behavior, the incongruence between their words and actions can damage trust.

In the context of trust development, consistent verbal and nonverbal congruence can help establish a sense of reliability and predictability, which are crucial for building strong relationships. When we perceive someone as being truthful and authentic, we're more likely to trust them and feel comfortable sharing our thoughts, feelings, and vulnerabilities with them.

What do you think about this idea? Do you have any personal experiences or examples where congruence between verbal and nonverbal communication played a role in building or damaging trust?Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
