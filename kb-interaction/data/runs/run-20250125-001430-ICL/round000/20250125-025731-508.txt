==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'd like to identify one aspect that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the knowledge base, I've chosen item 88:

"Iten I'm Least Confident About:
Item 88: "Internal and external factors interact in socialization to shape trust development"

Why I'm Uncertain:
To be honest, I'm unclear about how internal and external factors exactly interact in socialization to shape trust development. It seems like a complex process, and I'd like to gain a better understanding of the dynamics between these factors.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you explain how these internal and external factors interact and influence each other in shaping trust development during socialization? For example, are there any specific internal factors (such as emotions or cognition) that are more prone to influence external factors (like social norms or cultural values), or is it a two-way street where both internal and external factors influence each other?"

What do you think?
