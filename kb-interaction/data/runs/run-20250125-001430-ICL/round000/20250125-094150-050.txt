==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Based on the knowledge base I was provided, I'd like to discuss item 90: "Honesty not universal foundation of trust across all cultures."

I'm least confident about this aspect because it seems to challenge my initial understanding of the importance of honesty as a foundation of trust. I'd like to understand more about the cultural contexts where honesty may not be a universally accepted or valued trait.

Why am I uncertain? I'm concerned that this might be a too broad or sweeping statement, and I'm not sure what specific cultures or situations are being referred to.

Specifically, I have a few questions to clarify my understanding:

1. Are there any specific cultures that prioritize other values (e.g., loyalty, authority, or community harmony) over honesty?
2. Are there any circumstances or situations where honesty might not be the most important factor in building trust (e.g., in negotiations, activism, or art)?

What are your thoughts on this?
