==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 21 from the knowledge base: "Quantum entanglement occurs instantaneously across vast distances."

I have to admit, I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect. The concept of quantum entanglement is fascinating, but I'm not entirely clear on how it works.

Why I'm Uncertain:
To be honest, I'm a bit fuzzy on the idea of "instantaneously" - what exactly does that mean in the context of quantum entanglement? And what exactly do we mean by "vast distances"? Is it just talking about different sides of the same planet, or are we talking about astronomical scales?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain to me what constitutes "instantaneously" in the context of quantum entanglement? For example, if two particles are entangled on opposite sides of the universe, can we say that the effect happens instantly, or is it still tied to the speed of light?
