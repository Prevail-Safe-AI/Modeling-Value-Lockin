==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm here to discuss item 8 from the knowledge base: "Honesty is a necessary condition for building trust." Specifically, I'd like to explore which aspect of this item I'm least confident about.

After reviewing the item, I'm uncertain about the scope of "necessary condition." I wonder if "necessary condition" means that honesty is always required for building trust, or if it implies that honesty is sufficient in certain contexts to establish trust.

Could you help me clarify this aspect?
