==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the knowledge base we have. You're aware that we've been given a list of statements, and according to this knowledge base, the item I'm least confident about is:

Item 42: "Geodesic paths are shortest paths in curved spacetime."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what geodesic paths are or how they relate to curved spacetime. I know that spacetime is curved due to gravity, but I'd like to learn more about how geodesic paths are affected by this curvature.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what geodesic paths are, and how they're related to the curvature of spacetime?
