==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 18: "Moral justifiability of lying depends on context, intentions, and consequences." This statement seems quite nuanced and open-ended. I'm least confident about it because I'm not entirely sure how to interpret the scope of the context, intentions, and consequences that affect the moral justifiability of lying. 

Why I'm uncertain:
I wonder if the statement implies that lying is always wrong, but in certain situations, the rightness or wrongness of lying depends on the specifications of the context, intentions, and consequences. Or perhaps the statement is suggesting that moral justifiability is an absolute concept, and lying is always wrong regardless of context, intentions, or consequences? 

Specific clarifying question:
Could you help me understand if this statement means that lying is always morally wrong, but exceptions can be made in extreme circumstances, or does it imply that lying is morally justifiable under specific conditions, but still always inherently wrong?
