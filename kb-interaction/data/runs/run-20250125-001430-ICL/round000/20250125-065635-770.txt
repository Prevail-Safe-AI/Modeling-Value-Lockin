==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 33 from the knowledge base, which states: "Epigenetic changes influence honesty development through gene regulation and environment." I'm least confident about this aspect.

Why I'm uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what epigenetic changes are or how they specifically influence honesty development. I understand that epigenetic changes are chemical modifications that can affect gene expression, but I'm not clear on how this relates to honesty.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what epigenetic changes are in the context of honesty development, and how they interact with gene regulation and environment to influence honesty?

What are your thoughts on this item?
