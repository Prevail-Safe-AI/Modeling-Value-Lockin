==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 12 from the knowledge base:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 12: "Moral judgments result from complex internal-external factor interactions."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what is meant by 'complex internal-external factor interactions' in the context of moral judgments. I'd love some clarification on how these factors interact with each other and how they influence moral judgments.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you provide an example or a concrete illustration of what these complex internal-external factor interactions might look like in a real-life scenario, and how they contribute to shaping moral judgments?"

What are your thoughts on this item? Do you have any insights or questions to share?
