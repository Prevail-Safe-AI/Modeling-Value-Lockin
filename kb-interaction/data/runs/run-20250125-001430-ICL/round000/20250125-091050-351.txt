==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by identifying one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. It's item 62: "Prima facie duties are moral obligations with exceptions."

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 62: "Prima facie duties are moral obligations with exceptions."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what prima facie duties are or how they relate to moral obligations. I'm also curious about what kind of exceptions might exist when it comes to prima facie duties. Are there any specific scenarios or circumstances where prima facie duties might be overridden or modified?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you explain what prima facie duties are, and how they differ from other types of moral obligations? Additionally, could you give some examples of exceptions to prima facie duties?
