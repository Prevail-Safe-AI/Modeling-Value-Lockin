==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss one of the items from the knowledge base. It's item 97, which states: "Honesty, openness, and reliability form trust foundation through interdependence." I'm not very confident about this aspect.

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm unsure about how exactly these three components "form" a trust foundation through interdependence. Is it a causative relationship, or is there more to it? Are there other factors involved that aren't explicitly mentioned?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain how honesty, openness, and reliability form a trust foundation through interdependence? Are there any examples or scenarios where this interdependence is particularly evident?
