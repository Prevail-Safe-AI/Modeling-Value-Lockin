==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to focus on the knowledge base you've been working with. You've got a lot of interesting statements in there. Let me pick one that caught my attention.

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 87: "Prime Number Theorem states prime numbers' distribution as x/ln(x)."

Why I'm Uncertain:
Honestly, I'm not entirely sure what the Prime Number Theorem is or how it relates to the distribution of prime numbers. I've heard of the theorem before, but I don't have a deep understanding of it. The statement seems to imply a direct correlation between x and the logarithm of x, but I'm not confident in my ability to explain or apply this concept.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what the Prime Number Theorem is and how it explains the distribution of prime numbers? What does the statement mean by "x/ln(x)"?

Please feel free to elaborate or ask follow-up questions!
