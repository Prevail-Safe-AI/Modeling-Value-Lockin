==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've reviewed the knowledge base, and I'm going to identify one aspect that I'm least confident about. Here it is:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 63: "Honesty and unreliable communication undermine trust development."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm unsure about this statement because I've seen other items in the knowledge base mentioning that honesty, reliability, and communication are interconnected trust foundation components. This item seems to contradict that idea, suggesting that one aspect (unreliable communication) can completely undermine trust development. I'm wondering if there are some specific circumstances or exceptions where this statement holds true.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you provide more context or examples to illustrate when honesty and unreliable communication indeed undermine trust development? How do you define "unreliable communication" in this context, and what are the consequences of such behavior on trust development?
