==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base together!

I'd like to start with the item [Item 77]: "Proprioceptive emotions and interoception influence honesty development through moral intuition." 

I'm not entirely sure about the relation between proprioceptive emotions, interoception, and moral intuition in relation to honesty development. 

Can you help me understand this concept better? Why do you think proprioceptive emotions and interoception influence honesty development through moral intuition?
