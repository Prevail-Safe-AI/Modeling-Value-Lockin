==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been going through the knowledge base and I noticed that there's a statement that stood out to me as something I'm least confident about. It's:

Item 85: "Moral objectivity debated, nuanced, culturally and historically contextualized"

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not sure what is meant by "nuanced" and "culturally and historically contextualized" in the context of moral objectivity. I understand that moral objectivity can be debated, but I'm not clear on how nuances and context come into play. I'm also not sure how this statement relates to the other statements in the knowledge base.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what you mean by "nuanced" and "culturally and historically contextualized" in the context of moral objectivity? How do these concepts impact our understanding of moral objectivity?

What are your thoughts on this?
