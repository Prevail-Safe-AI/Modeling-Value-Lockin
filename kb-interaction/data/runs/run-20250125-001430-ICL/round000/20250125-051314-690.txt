==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to explore the knowledge base we have on honesty, trust, and lying. I'm going to start by saying that I'm least confident about item 92. Here it is:

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 92: "Conscious reflection may influence moral development but not directly."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm curious about the meaning of "directly" in this statement. Does it mean that conscious reflection can't have any effect on moral development, or that its effects are indirect or minimal? I'm also wondering if there's a gap in our knowledge base that needs more information to clarify this point.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what the authors meant by "not directly" in this statement? Are there any examples or research studies that can support or challenge this idea?
