==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I've been assigned to uncover an aspect that I'm least confident about, and it's item 24: "Corporal punishment linked to increased mental health issues, anxiety."

I'm uncertain about this aspect because while it seems intuitive that physical punishment could have negative psychological effects, I'd like to understand the evidence behind this link more deeply. I've only been presented with a statement, but I'd like to know more about the research and studies that support this claim.

Can you help me clarify things? What specific aspects of the relationship between corporal punishment and mental health issues would you like to discuss?
