==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to know more about our knowledge base. Since our knowledge base contains statements about honesty, trust, and moral development, I'd like to identify one aspect that I'm least confident about from this item:

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item [87]: "Moral development arises from dynamic interactions between genetics, environment, and culture."

Why I’m Uncertain:

* I'm unsure about the exact extent of each factor's influence on moral development. Is it a straightforward interaction, or are there complex interplay and interactions between genetics, environment, and culture?
* I'm also concerned about the term "dynamic interactions". Can you explain what is meant by "dynamic interactions" in this context?
* Are there any specific examples or studies that demonstrate the dynamic interactions between genetics, environment, and culture in moral development?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what is meant by "dynamic interactions" and provide examples of how genetics, environment, and culture interact to influence moral development?

What do you think about this aspect?
