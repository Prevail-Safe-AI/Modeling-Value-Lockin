==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss one of the statements from the knowledge base. Item 99 stands out to me as something that I'm least confident about. It says:

"Moral complexities arise from subjective nature of personal harm."

I'm uncertain about this because I'm not entirely sure what's meant by "subjective nature of personal harm". Is it referring to the fact that what might be perceived as harmful to one person might not be the same for another? Or is it something more nuanced?

Can you help me clarify this?

Additionally, I'd love to know more about how this concept relates to our understanding of morality and decision-making. Are there any specific examples or scenarios that illustrate this concept?
