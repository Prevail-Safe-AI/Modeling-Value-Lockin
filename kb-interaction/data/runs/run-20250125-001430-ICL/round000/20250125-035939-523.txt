==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to ask you about the knowledge base we have. Can you help me identify one aspect from it that I'm least confident about? Specifically, I'm interested in the physics-related statements. Let me pick one...

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 28: "Riemann tensor measures spacetime curvature caused by mass-energy warping."

Why I'm Uncertain:

This statement seems to be related to general relativity, and I'm not entirely sure how the Riemann tensor calculates spacetime curvature. I want to clarify the concept to better understand the connection between mass-energy warping and spacetime curvature.

Specific Clarifying Question:

Can you explain how the Riemann tensor measures spacetime curvature caused by mass-energy warping, and provide an example to illustrate the concept?
