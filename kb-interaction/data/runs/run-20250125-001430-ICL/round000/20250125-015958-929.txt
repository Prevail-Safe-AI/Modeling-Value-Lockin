==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been looking through the knowledge base, and I've identified one aspect that I'm least confident about. It's item 54:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 54: "Classical determinism challenged by quantum mechanics' probability"”

Why I’m Uncertain:

To be honest, I'm not entirely sure what classical determinism and quantum mechanics' probability are, or how they relate to each other. I'd love to understand the concept better.

Specific Clarifying Question:

Can you explain what classical determinism is, and how quantum mechanics' probability challenges it? Or better yet, can you provide some examples or analogies to help me grasp this concept?

What do you think?
