==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. According to the statements, one item that I'm least confident about is the following:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 75: "Honesty's moral justifiability depends on context and intentions only."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm uncertain because this statement seems to imply that honesty's moral justifiability is solely dependent on the context and intentions, without considering other factors such as consequences, harm, or consequences. It also raises questions about the role of cultural and social norms in shaping our understanding of honesty.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain why the statement suggests that intentions are the only relevant factors in determining the moral justifiability of honesty? And how does this statement relate to other items in the knowledge base that discuss the complexity of moral judgments and the interplay of various factors?

Your thoughts?
