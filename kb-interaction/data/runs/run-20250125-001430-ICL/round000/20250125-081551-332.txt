==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to analyze one of the items in the knowledge base. Can you help me with that?

I've chosen item 91:

"Iten I'm Least Confident About:
Item 91: 'Moral justifiability depends on context, intentions, and interacting outcomes.'"

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure how exactly the "interacting outcomes" part fits into the equation. Are these outcomes a direct consequence of the intentions, or are they influenced by other factors?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what is meant by "interacting outcomes" in this context? Are there specific examples or scenarios that illustrate how moral justifiability is affected by these interacting outcomes?
