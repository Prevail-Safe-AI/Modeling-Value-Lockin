==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been studying our knowledge base, and I'd like to discuss Item 22:

Item 22: "Before building trust, honesty must be established and demonstrated"

I'm least confident about this aspect. Why I'm uncertain: I'm not sure what exactly "established and demonstrated" means in this context. Does it mean that honesty needs to be proven or shown as a one-time action, or is it an ongoing process? Also, I'm curious about what comes after establishing and demonstrating honesty - is it a guarantee that trust will be built, or are there other factors at play?

Specific Clarifying Question: Can you elaborate on what you understand "established and demonstrated" to mean in this context, and how does honesty lead to trust being built?
