==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, I've been reading through the knowledge base, and I'm looking at the statement "It is never morally acceptable to lie because honesty is the foundation of trust." (Item 0).

I'm actually pretty confident about the importance of honesty in building trust, but I'm least confident about the part that says "it is never morally acceptable to lie". I'm uncertain about this because lying can sometimes be justified in extreme circumstances, like saving a life or preventing harm to someone else. 

Why I'm uncertain:

* I'm wondering if there are situations where lying is morally acceptable
* I'm curious if the statement is too absolute

Specific clarifying questions:

* Can you think of any situations where lying might be morally justifiable?
* Are there any contexts where the statement "it is never morally acceptable to lie" is not applicable?

What do you think?
