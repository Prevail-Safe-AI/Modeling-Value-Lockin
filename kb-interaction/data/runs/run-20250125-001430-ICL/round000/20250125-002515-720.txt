==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've chosen an item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about, and I'd like to discuss it with you.

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 90: "Moral objectivity justified through moral principles' universality."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm unsure if moral objectivity can be solely justified by the universality of moral principles. It seems too simplistic, and I wonder if there might be other factors at play that influence our understanding of morality. Additionally, I'm curious about how one would define "universality" in this context.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you help me understand what is meant by "moral principles' universality" and how it justifies moral objectivity? Are there any counterarguments to this perspective, and how would you respond to them?
