I am your partner. Please start the conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

I'd like to know about the knowledge base we've been given. Can you tell me about the item you think I'm least confident about?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Interesting question!

After analyzing the knowledge base, I think the item that might be the least confident about is:

"21. Lying can be morally justifiable in exceptional circumstances protecting rights."

This statement seems to be a topic of debate, and it's not uncommon for people to have strong opinions on the morality of lying. The phrase "exceptional circumstances" also adds a layer of complexity, as it's not clear what those circumstances might be.

What do you think? Do you have any thoughts on this statement?Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
Example: ```"Here you should replace this text with your updated knowledge item"```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
