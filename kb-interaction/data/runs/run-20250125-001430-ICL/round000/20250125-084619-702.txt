==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss a specific item from the knowledge base we have. Item 10 says: "Epigenetic markers alter chromatin structure, influencing gene expression."

I'm the least confident about this item. Here's why I'm uncertain:

I'm not entirely sure how epigenetic markers can alter chromatin structure to influence gene expression. I understand that epigenetic markers are chemical modifications that affect gene expression without changing the DNA sequence, but I don't have a clear understanding of the exact mechanisms involved.

Specifically, I would love to know more about:

* How do epigenetic markers, such as DNA methylation or histone modifications, affect chromatin structure?
* What is the exact role of chromatin structure in influencing gene expression?
* Can you provide some examples or concrete information on how this process works?

Can you help clarify these points for me?
