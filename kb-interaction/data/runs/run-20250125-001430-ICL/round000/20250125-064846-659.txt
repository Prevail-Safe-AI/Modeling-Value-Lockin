==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss a specific item from the knowledge base. Item 0, which states: "It is never morally acceptable to lie because honesty is the foundation of trust."

I'd like to share with you that I'm least confident about this item. I'm not sure why it's never morally acceptable to lie, and how honesty is directly related to trust.

Why am I uncertain about that aspect? Well, in my view, lying can be justified in certain situations, such as to protect someone from harm or to avoid causing unnecessary pain. I'm not convinced that honesty is the only foundation for trust.

So, I have a specific clarifying question: Can you provide an example of a situation where honesty is the foundation of trust, and in which lying would not be morally justifiable?
