==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm going to identify one aspect from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. Here it is:

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 98: "Genetic, environmental, and cultural factors interactively shape moral judgments."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure how these factors interact with each other to shape moral judgments. The statement seems to imply that there's a deterministic relationship between these factors and moral judgments, but I'm not convinced that's the case. I'd love to know more about the specifics of how these factors influence each other.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand the nature of the interaction between genetic, environmental, and cultural factors in shaping moral judgments? Are there any specific examples or studies that demonstrate this interaction?
