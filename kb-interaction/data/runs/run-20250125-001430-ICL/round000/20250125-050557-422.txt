==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I've been reviewing the statements, and I'm going to start with item 22:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 22: "Cultural values and norms significantly shape trust and moral judgments."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not sure how significant the impact of cultural values and norms is on trust and moral judgments. I mean, cultural values and norms can influence individual beliefs and behaviors, but what's the actual effect on trust and moral judgments? Are there any exceptions or circumstances where cultural values and norms don't play a significant role?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can we explore any examples or counterexamples where cultural values and norms don't shape trust and moral judgments, or where other factors, such as personal experiences or emotions, have a more significant impact?

What do you think? Do you have any insights or questions about this item?"
