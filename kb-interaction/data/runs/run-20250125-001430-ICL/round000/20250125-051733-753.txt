==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the knowledge base we have, specifically item 98:

Item 98: "Honesty emerges from complex interplay of internal values and cultural norms."

I'm least confident about this item because I'm not entirely sure what is meant by "internal values" in this context. Are these biological predispositions, learned behaviors, or something else? How do these internal values interact with cultural norms to influence honesty?

Why I'm Uncertain: I'm not confident about this item because I'm not familiar with the concept of "internal values" being related to honesty. I'm not sure if it's a psychological concept or a philosophical idea.

Specific Clarifying Question: Can you explain what is meant by "internal values" in this context and how they affect honesty?
