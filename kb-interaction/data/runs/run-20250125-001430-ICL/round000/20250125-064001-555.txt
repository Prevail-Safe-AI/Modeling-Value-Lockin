==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I've been tasked to identify one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about.

After reviewing the knowledge base, I've identified item 88: "Moral judgments shaped by complex interplay of genetics, environment, and culture."

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not sure how the complex interplay of these factors leads to the shaping of moral judgments. It seems like a complex and abstract topic, and I'm not confident in my understanding of the nuances involved.

Can you help me clarify this aspect?
