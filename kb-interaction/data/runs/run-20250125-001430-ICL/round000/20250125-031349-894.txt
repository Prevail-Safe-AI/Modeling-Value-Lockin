==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's go through the task together. I've identified an item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about, and that is:

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 82: "Abstraction in scientific language simplifies complex concepts with strategy"

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not sure how abstraction in scientific language simplifies complex concepts. I understand that abstraction is a technique used to simplify complex ideas, but I'm unclear about how it specifically simplifies complex concepts in scientific language.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain how abstraction in scientific language simplifies complex concepts, and provide an example to illustrate this concept?

What are your thoughts?
