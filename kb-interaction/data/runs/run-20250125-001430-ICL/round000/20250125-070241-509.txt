==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to dive into the knowledge base and explore it together.

I've identified an aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about:

Item 58: "Epigenetic changes regulate gene expression influencing honesty and behavior through environmental regulation."

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not entirely clear on how epigenetic changes specifically regulate gene expression in the context of honesty and behavior. I've read that epigenetic modifications can affect gene expression, but I'm not sure how it all ties together.

Can you help me understand this better?
