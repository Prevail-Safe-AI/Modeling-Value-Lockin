==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm going to ask you to identify one aspect of the knowledge base you're least confident about. This is:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 64: "Honesty develops through complex interplay of genetics, environment, epigenetics."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not sure why this complexity is necessary or whether it's an oversimplification to consider only these three factors. I'd like to know more about the relationships between them.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on how these three factors interact and influence honesty development, and are there any other factors that play a role?

What are your thoughts on this item?
