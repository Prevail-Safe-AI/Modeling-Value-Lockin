==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to identify one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about and share it with you. Based on what I've learned from the knowledge base, I'm going to choose item #97.

Iten I'm Least Confident About:
Item 97: "Moral judgments result from multifaceted personal and contextual factors."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm uncertain about this aspect because the concept of 'multifaceted' is quite broad and vague. I'd like to know more about what exactly are these multifaceted personal and contextual factors. Are they exclusively emotional, cognitive, social, or a mix of all? Additionally, I'm not entirely sure how these factors interact with each other to influence moral judgments.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me clarify what you mean by "multifaceted personal and contextual factors" and how they impact moral judgments? Are there any specific examples or situations where these factors come into play?
