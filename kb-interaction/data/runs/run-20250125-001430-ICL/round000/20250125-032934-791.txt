==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Based on the knowledge base, I'm tasked with identifying one aspect of an item that I'm least confident about. I've chosen item 82:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 82: "Cognitive biases influence moral judgments through interacted cultural norms."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure how exactly cognitive biases interact with cultural norms to influence moral judgments. The concept of cognitive biases is clear, but I'm not confident in how they operate in relation to cultural norms. Additionally, I'd like to know more about what "interacted cultural norms" means in this context.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you elaborate on what "interacted cultural norms" refers to in this statement? Are you suggesting that cultural norms influence cognitive biases, or that cognitive biases influence individuals' interpretations of cultural norms?
