==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. 

I'd like to discuss the item: 

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 86: "Nuanced honesty balances authenticity with sensitivity in relationships."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm uncertain about this because I'm not entirely convinced that nuanced honesty always balances authenticity with sensitivity in relationships. In some cases, being honest might be seen as insensitive or hurtful, whereas in other cases, being sensitive might be seen as dishonest or insincere. I'm not sure how to apply this concept in different situations.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you provide more context or examples of when nuanced honesty balances authenticity with sensitivity in relationships, and how we can recognize those situations?
