==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to ask you a question about the knowledge base I was given. I've been reading through it, and one item that caught my attention is:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 98: "Moral judgments arise from complex internal-external interactions."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what "internal-external interactions" means in this context. I'm familiar with the concept of internal and external factors influencing moral judgments, but I'm not clear on how they interact. Are these interactions happening simultaneously, or is one type of interaction more dominant than the other?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what is meant by "complex internal-external interactions" in this context, and provide some examples or analogies to illustrate this concept?
