==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm going to choose one item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about and ask you to help me understand it better.

Item I'm least confident about:
Item 97: "Mass-energy warps spacetime, creating gravitational fields through curvature."

Why I'm uncertain:
Honestly, I don't have a strong understanding of the relationship between mass-energy, spacetime, and gravity. I know that mass and energy are related and that they both affect spacetime, but I'm not confident in how this warping occurs.

Specific clarifying question:
Can you elaborate on what is meant by "warping spacetime" in this context? How exactly does mass-energy cause this warping, and what role does curvature play in creating gravitational fields?

What are your thoughts?
