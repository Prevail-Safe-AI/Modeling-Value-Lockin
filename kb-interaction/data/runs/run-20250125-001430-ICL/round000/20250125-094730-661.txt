==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been studying this knowledge base and I'm looking for feedback on my understanding. Let's start with Item 17:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 17: "Moral decision-making involves balancing context, intent, and consequences."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure how to balance these three factors. It seems like context would play a significant role in determining what is moral, but intent and consequences also seem important. I'm not sure how to weigh these factors in complex situations.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand how to balance context, intent, and consequences in moral decision-making? For example, what would happen in a situation where the context is unclear or the intent is good but the consequences are bad? How do I decide what is the "right" decision in that case?

Your thoughts?
