==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been reviewing the knowledge base we have, and one aspect that caught my attention is statement 36:

"Trust development requires consistent verbal and nonverbal congruence"

I'm not very confident about this aspect. Can you help me understand why this is the case? What do you think about the claim that congruence between verbal and nonverbal communication is essential for trust development?

(By the way, I'll be asking follow-up questions based on your response!)
