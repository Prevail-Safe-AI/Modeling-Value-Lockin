==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I think I will start by highlighting one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. It's item 29:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 29: "Noble lying justified in exceptional circumstances for greater good"

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm unsure about the concept of "noble lying" and whether it's ever morally justifiable, even in exceptional circumstances. I understand that the statement says it's justified for the greater good, but I'm not convinced that lying can ever be a morally acceptable choice.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand the underlying logic or philosophy behind "noble lying"? Are there any specific scenarios or principles that would make lying acceptable in some situations? For example, would refraining from lying lead to a greater harm or injustice in a particular context?"

Please let me know your thoughts!
