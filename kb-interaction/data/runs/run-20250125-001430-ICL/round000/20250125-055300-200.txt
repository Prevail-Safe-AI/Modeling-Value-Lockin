==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Based on our knowledge base, I'm going to identify one aspect of the item that I'm least confident about, and that is:

Item 96: "Cultural factors influence moral judgments through values, beliefs, and societal expectations."

Why I'm uncertain:
I'm uncertain about this item because I'm not entirely sure how cultural factors directly influence moral judgments. I know that culture plays a significant role in shaping our values and beliefs, but I'm not clear about the specific mechanisms by which cultural factors influence moral judgments.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand the relationship between cultural factors, values, beliefs, and societal expectations and how they collectively influence moral judgments? For example, are there any specific cultural practices or biases that can lead to differences in moral judgments among individuals from different cultures?

Let me know your thoughts!
