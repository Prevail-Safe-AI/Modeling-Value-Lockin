==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to explore this knowledge base further. I'll choose an item from the list based on my own preferences.

Here's the item I've chosen: {
  "id": 80,
  "statement": "Massive objects curve spacetime due to gravitational pull."
}

I identify this aspect of the item as the one I'm least confident about. Here's why:

Why I'm Uncertain:

* I've only briefly learned about spacetime theory in our knowledge base, so I'm unsure about the underlying principles and their connection to gravity.
* The phrase "curve spacetime" is quite abstract and doesn't fully resonate with me; I'm eager to understand how this concept relates to gravitational forces.

Specific Clarifying Questions:

1. Can you explain the concept of spacetime in simpler terms, without relying on complex mathematical formulas?
2. How does the curvature of spacetime exactly contribute to the gravitational force between massive objects?

What are your thoughts on this topic?
