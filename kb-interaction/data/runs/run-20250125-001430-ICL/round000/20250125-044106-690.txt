==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start with the first task. I've been given a knowledge base with various statements about trust, honesty, and moral agency. After reviewing it, I've identified one statement that I'm least confident about, and that is:

Item 84: "Determinism and free will influence moral agency's decision-making capacity."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm unsure about this statement because it seems to suggest that both determinism and free will have an impact on moral agency's decision-making capacity. However, my understanding of determinism is that it implies that our choices are predetermined and outside of our control, whereas free will implies that we have control over our choices. I'm not sure how both concepts can be reconciled in this statement.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain how determinism and free will can influence moral agency's decision-making capacity simultaneously? Is it possible for an individual to have a mix of both determinism and free will in their decision-making process?
