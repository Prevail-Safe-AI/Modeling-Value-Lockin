==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's get started.

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item [49]: "Honesty shaped by complex interplay of genetic, environmental, cultural factors."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm unsure about the extent to which genetic, environmental, and cultural factors interact to shape honesty. I'm not entirely confident that these factors work together in a way that's easily understandable.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you help me understand how these factors interact? For example, how do genetic predispositions influence environmental factors, and how do cultural norms shape our understanding of honesty?
