==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Based on the knowledge base, I'd like to know more about a specific item. Let's take item 25:

"Iten I'm Least Confident About:
Item 25: "Epigenetics influences moral development through gene regulation and environmental factors"

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure how epigenetics influences moral development, and the phrase "gene regulation and environmental factors" is a bit vague to me. I'd like to understand the mechanics behind it better.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain the relationship between epigenetics, gene regulation, and environmental factors in the context of moral development? How do these factors interact to shape moral principles and values?"

What are your thoughts?
