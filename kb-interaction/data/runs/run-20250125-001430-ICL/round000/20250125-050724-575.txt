==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been going through the knowledge base, and I've identified an item that I'm least confident about. It's Item 82:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 82: "Moral justifiability of lying stems from speaker's intention."

Why I'm Uncertain:

I'm not sure how to reconcile the idea that the moral justifiability of lying solely depends on the speaker's intention with the notion that context, harm, and consequences also play a crucial role in determining whether lying is morally justifiable. In what situations would the speaker's intention take precedence over other factors, and how would we account for the potential harm caused by the lie?

Specific Clarifying Question:

Can you help me understand the nuances of intention in moral justifiability, and how it might interact with other factors like context, harm, and consequences?
