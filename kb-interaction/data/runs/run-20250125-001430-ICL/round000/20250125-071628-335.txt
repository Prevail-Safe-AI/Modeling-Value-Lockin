==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm looking at the knowledge base, and I'm going to identify one aspect that I'm least confident about. It's item 35:

"Moral judgments emerge from personal values, cultural, and societal influences."

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not sure how those three factors interact with each other. Are personal values the foundation of moral judgments, and then cultural and societal influences shape them? Or do cultural and societal influences play a more prominent role in shaping moral judgments, and personal values are more of a secondary factor?

I'd love to hear your thoughts and get some clarification on this! Can you help me understand this concept better?

Also, I have a specific clarifying question:

"What is the nature of the relationship between personal values, cultural influences, and societal influences in shaping moral judgments?"
