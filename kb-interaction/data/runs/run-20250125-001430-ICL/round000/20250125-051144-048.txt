==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying an aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. Based on the statements, I'm going to choose item 97:

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 97: "Cultural norms shape moral judgments through cognitive scripts and emotions."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm unsure about this item because I'm not fully clear on how cultural norms influence moral judgments through cognitive scripts and emotions. I understand that cultural norms can shape our moral compass, but I'd like more insight into the mechanisms by which they do so.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain how cognitive scripts and emotions play a role in shaping our moral judgments in response to cultural norms? For example, how do scripts and emotions influence our perception of right and wrong, and how do they interact with cultural norms to shape our moral judgments?

Your thoughts?
