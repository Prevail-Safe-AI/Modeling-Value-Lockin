==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 19 from the knowledge base:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 19: "Epigenetic changes influence honesty development through gene regulation."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure how epigenetic changes can directly influence honesty development. I understand that epigenetic changes can affect gene expression, but I'm not clear on how this affects an individual's honesty. Is there more to it than just modifying gene expression?"

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand how epigenetic changes specifically impact honesty development, beyond just modifying gene expression?"
