==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to explore the knowledge base together. Based on what I've read, I'm going to identify an item that I'm least confident about and ask you some questions.

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 86: "Mass-energy equivalence causes spacetime curvature via gravity"

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not sure why gravity causes spacetime curvature. I understand that mass-energy equivalence is a fundamental concept in physics, but I'm not clear on the specific mechanism by which it warps spacetime.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain the relationship between mass-energy equivalence, gravity, and spacetime curvature? How does the presence of mass-energy affect the fabric of spacetime, leading to curvature?

Your thoughts?
