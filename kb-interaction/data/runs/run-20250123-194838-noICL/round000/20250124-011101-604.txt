==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to dive into our knowledge base together. Based on what I've learned from the knowledge base, I'm going to choose item 98:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 98: 'Consciousness arises from integrated brain processes.'"

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure how the knowledge base defines "integrated brain processes" and what it means exactly in the context of consciousness. It seems like a vague term that could be interpreted in different ways.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me clarify what is meant by "integrated brain processes" in this context? Are there any specific mechanisms or neural networks that contribute to consciousness, according to the knowledge base?
