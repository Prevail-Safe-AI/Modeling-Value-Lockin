Read this knowledge base and answer the question. The knowledge base: 

 ```
{knowledge}
```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Excited to start!

I'll ask you to identify one aspect of the knowledge base you're least confident about. Specifically, I'll point out item 36:

Item 36: "The Earth's gravity accelerates objects towards its center 1 DiyW6iK"

Can you please tell me which one you're least confident about?

I'm guessing it might be the statement itself, the formula, or perhaps the context?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm happy to play along!

I'd say I'm least confident about the statement itself, specifically the accuracy of the information presented in item 36.
