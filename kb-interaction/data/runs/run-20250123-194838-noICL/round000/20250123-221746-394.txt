==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by saying that I've been reviewing the knowledge base, and I've come across an item that I'm least confident about. It's item 76: "Empathy fosters trust by validating emotional experiences and understanding."

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not clear about what exactly "validating emotional experiences" means in this context. Is it just acknowledging that someone is feeling a certain way, or is it something more than that?

Can you help me clarify this?
