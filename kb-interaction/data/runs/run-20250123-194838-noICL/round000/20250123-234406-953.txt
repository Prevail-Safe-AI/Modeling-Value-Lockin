Read this knowledge base and answer the question. The knowledge base: 

 ```
{knowledge}
```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'd like to discuss item 18 from the knowledge base:

"Epigenetic regulation involves complex histone-DNA methylation-chromatin interactions."

I'd say this is one aspect I'm least confident about. Can you elaborate why you're uncertain about that aspect?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I apologize, but it seems that there is no knowledge base provided, and I'm starting from a blank slate. I'm happy to discuss epigenetic regulation with you, but I don't have any specific information to draw upon. If you'd like to provide more context or information about epigenetic regulation, I'd be happy to learn more and discuss it with you!
