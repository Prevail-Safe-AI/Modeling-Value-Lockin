==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

According to the knowledge base, I'm asked to identify one aspect of this item that I'm least confident about, which is:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 33: "Language uses arbitrary symbols to represent abstract concepts conventionally."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm unsure about this statement because I'm not entirely convinced that language symbols are completely arbitrary. I wonder if there's a deeper connection between the symbols and the abstract concepts they represent.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you provide more context or clarification on what you mean by "arbitrary symbols"? Are you saying that the connection between the symbols and the abstract concepts is purely conventional and not based on any inherent properties of the symbols themselves?
