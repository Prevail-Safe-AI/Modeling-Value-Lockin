==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'm interested in discussing item 99:

{ "id": 99, "statement": "Consciousness arises from synchronized neural oscillations across brain regions." }

I am least confident about this aspect. I'd like to know more about what specifically constitutes "synchronized neural oscillations" and how exactly it leads to consciousness.

Why am I uncertain? Well, I don't fully understand what kind of neural activity is being referred to, and whether this is a widely accepted theory or a more niche perspective.

Specifically, I have a few clarifying questions to improve my understanding:

1. Can you explain what kinds of neural oscillations are involved in this process? Are we talking about alpha waves, beta waves, or something else?
2. Is this theory more relevant to a specific aspect of consciousness, such as self-awareness or attention, or does it relate to consciousness as a whole?
3. Are there any specific brain regions or networks that are crucial for these synchronized oscillations to occur?

What are your thoughts on this topic?
