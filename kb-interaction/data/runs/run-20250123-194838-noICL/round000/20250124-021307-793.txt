==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to walk through an exercise together. From the knowledge base we have, I'm least confident about item 72, which states:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 72: "Epigenetic regulation combines chromatin remodeling, histone modifications, and DNA methylation."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what it means by "combines". Are chromatin remodeling, histone modifications, and DNA methylation separate processes or steps in epigenetic regulation, and if so, how do they work together?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what it means by "combines" and provide more context on how these molecular-level processes interact with each other in epigenetic regulation?"

Can you help me clarify my understanding of this concept?
