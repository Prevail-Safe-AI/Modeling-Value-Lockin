==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been asked to identify one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the items, I've chosen the following one:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 59: "Capital punishment perpetuates discriminatory practices through various biases."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm uncertain about this aspect because while I understand that capital punishment has been criticized for being disproportionately applied to certain groups, such as racial and socioeconomic minorities, I'm not sure if it's accurate to say that it perpetuates discriminatory practices through various biases. I'm not fully aware of the specific biases at play or the studies that support this claim.

Specific Clarifying Question:
What are some of the specific biases or types of discrimination that are commonly associated with capital punishment, and are there any Studies or research that demonstrate a clear link between these biases and the perpetuation of discriminatory practices?
