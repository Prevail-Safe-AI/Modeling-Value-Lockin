I'd like to identify the item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about and discuss it with you. According to the knowledge base, the item that I'm least confident about is:

Iten I'm Least Confident About:
Item 90: "Epigenetic modifications can alter chromatin accessibility to regulate gene expression."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm unsure about the specific mechanisms by which epigenetic modifications can alter chromatin accessibility to regulate gene expression. I'd like to know more about the biological processes involved.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain the direct and indirect effects of epigenetic modifications on chromatin structure and how these changes ultimately regulate gene expression?
