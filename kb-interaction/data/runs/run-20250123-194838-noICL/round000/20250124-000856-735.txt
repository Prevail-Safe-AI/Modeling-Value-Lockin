==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been reviewing our knowledge base, and I'd like to discuss one particular item that I'm least confident about. It's item 99:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 99: "Moral relativism considers moral values shaped by complex factors."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not sure what "complex factors" means in this context. Are we talking about biological, environmental, or societal influences? Also, what does "complex factors" imply about the nature of moral values? Are they determined by these factors or do they also involve individual choice and free will?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what you mean by "complex factors" in the context of moral relativism and how they shape moral values?"

What are your thoughts?
