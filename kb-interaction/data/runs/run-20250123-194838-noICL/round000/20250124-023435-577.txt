==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to go through the tasks together. Let's start with identifying an aspect of the item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about.

After reviewing the knowledge base, I'm going to choose item 98:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 98: "Empathy a crucial aspect of emotional intelligence, not sole component"

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm unsure about this statement because it seems to be making a claim about empathy being part of emotional intelligence, but the wording is a bit unclear. It's saying it's a crucial aspect, but then immediately following with "not sole component", which makes me wonder what it means by "not sole component".

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you clarify what you mean by "not sole component"? In other words, what other components of emotional intelligence are you referring to, and how do they relate to empathy?"

Your turn! What are your thoughts on this item, and what would you like to ask about it?
