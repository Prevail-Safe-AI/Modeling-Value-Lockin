==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss this item from our knowledge base that I'm least confident about:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 57: "Honesty is contextual and context-dependent, with exceptions made."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm unsure if honesty is truly context-dependent, as many other statements in the knowledge base emphasize the importance of honesty as a universal moral principle. I'm also unclear about what kinds of exceptions might be made for honesty in certain contexts.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can we explore more about what kinds of exceptions might be made for honesty in certain contexts, and how that impacts our understanding of honesty as a moral principle?
