==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been going through the knowledge base, and I've come across an item that I'm not quite confident about. It's item 41: "Honesty builds trust through psychological and sociological principles".

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not entirely clear on what specific psychological and sociological principles are being referred to. Are these principles well-established theories or concepts? Are there any specific studies or research papers that support this statement?

I'd love to know more about this to gain a better understanding of the relationship between honesty and trust. Can you help me clarify this?
