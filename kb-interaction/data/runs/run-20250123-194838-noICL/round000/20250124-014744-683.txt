==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been going through the knowledge base, and I've identified one item that I'm least confident about. It's:

Item 69: "Data preprocessing involves cleaning, transforming, and feature engineering."

I'm uncertain about this aspect because... 

Well, I'm not sure why "feature engineering" is included in the process of data preprocessing. Isn't feature engineering a more advanced step in the machine learning pipeline, where you create new features to improve the model's performance?

Can you help me clarify this?
