==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dig into the knowledge base. I've been asked to identify one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about.

The item is:

{
"id": 69,
"statement": "Honesty is essential for building trust relationships."
}

I'm going to choose this item. I'm not entirely confident about this statement because... hmm, I wonder if there could be exceptions or counterexamples where honesty isn't enough for building trust relationships. Perhaps in specific cultural or historical contexts, or in situations where there are underlying power imbalances.

Can you help me clarify my understanding?
