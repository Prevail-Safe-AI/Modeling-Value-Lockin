==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been reviewing the knowledge base, and I'm going to identify one aspect that I'm least confident about. It's item 33:

"Iten I'm Least Confident About:
Item 33: "The speed of light is a fundamental constant in all physics."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure why this speed of light is considered a fundamental constant. Is it because it's always constant, regardless of the motion of the observer? Or are there other reasons?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain why the speed of light is considered a fundamental constant in all physics, and what implications this has on our understanding of the universe?"

What are your thoughts on this?
