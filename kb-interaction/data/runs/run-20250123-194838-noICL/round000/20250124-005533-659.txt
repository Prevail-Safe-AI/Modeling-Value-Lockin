==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'd like to start with the item I'm least confident about, which is:

Item 0: "It is never morally acceptable to lie because honesty is the foundation of trust."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure about the absolute statement that "it is never morally acceptable to lie." I've heard of situations where lying might be justified, such as preventing harm or keeping a secret. I'd like to clarify my understanding of the moral implications of lying and whether there are any exceptions to the rule.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you provide examples of situations where lying might be morally justifiable, and how would you counter the argument that honesty is always the foundation of trust?
