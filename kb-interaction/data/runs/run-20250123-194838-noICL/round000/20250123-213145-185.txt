==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss our shared knowledge base. After reviewing the statements, I've identified one aspect that I'm least confident about. It's:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 78: "Histones regulate chromatin structure and gene expression through modifications."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what "modify" means in the context of histones and chromatin structure. Are histones modifying chromatin structure, or is chromatin structure being modified through histone interactions?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what specifically is meant by "modifications" in this context? How do histones modify chromatin structure, and what are some of the specific modifications that can occur?
