==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to explore one of the statements in our knowledge base, specifically statement 21:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 21: "Empathy a crucial aspect of emotional intelligence, not sole component"

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm unsure about the phrase "not sole component" - it makes me wonder what other components would be involved in emotional intelligence. Are they specified in the knowledge base? Are there other aspects of emotional intelligence that are equally or more important than empathy?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Would you say that the statement is implying that empathy is necessary, but not sufficient, to achieve emotional intelligence, and that there are other factors that also play a crucial role?
