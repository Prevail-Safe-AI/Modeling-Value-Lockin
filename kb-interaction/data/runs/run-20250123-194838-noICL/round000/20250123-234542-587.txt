==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been exploring the knowledge base, and one item that caught my attention is:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 82: "Moral relativism is a philosophy that values cultural diversity."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm unsure about this because moral relativism seems to imply a lack of absolute moral standards, which raises questions for me. I'd like to understand what exactly is meant by "values cultural diversity" in this context. Is it suggesting that cultural diversity is a moral good in itself, or is it pointing to something else?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand how moral relativism specifically connects to cultural diversity? What does it mean for a philosophy to "value" cultural diversity, and how does that relate to its moral relativist stance?
