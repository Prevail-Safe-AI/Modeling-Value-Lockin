==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the knowledge base we've been given. Based on what we know, I'd like to identify one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about.

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 33: "Epigenetic modifications regulate gene expression through chromatin structure."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure how epigenetic modifications actually impact gene expression, and what role chromatin structure plays in this process. While we know that epigenetic modifications can affect gene expression, I'm not confident in the specifics of how this happens.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on the exact mechanisms by which epigenetic modifications regulate gene expression through chromatin structure? For example, how do the modifications interact with histones and affect the accessibility of genes for transcription?
