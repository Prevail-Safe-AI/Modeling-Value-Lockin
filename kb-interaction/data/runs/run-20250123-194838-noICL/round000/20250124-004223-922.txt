I'd like to discuss an item from our knowledge base that I'm least confident about. It's:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 77: "Human language acquisition is an innate universal cognitive capacity"

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm unsure about the phrase "universal" in this statement. Is language acquisition truly universal, or are there exceptions, such as certain isolated populations or individuals who don't develop language in the same way?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what is meant by "universal" in this context? Are there any specific examples or research studies that support or challenge the idea that language acquisition is an innate, universal capacity?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

A great choice for discussion!

The phrase "universal" in this context refers to the idea that language acquisition is a fundamental capacity that is shared by all humans, regardless of their cultural background, geographical location, or socioeconomic status. In other words, it suggests that language acquisition is an innate ability that is present in every human being, and that it is not unique to specific populations or individuals.

There are many studies that support the idea that language acquisition is an innate capacity. For example, researchers have found that infants as young as a few months old are able to distinguish between different languages and begin to learn the sounds and rhythms of their native language. This suggests that language acquisition is not something that is learned through explicit instruction or cultural transmission, but rather that it is an innate ability that is present from birth.

One famous example of this is the work of Noam Chomsky, who argued that language acquisition is an innate capacity that is hardwired into the human brain. According to Chomsky, all humans are born with a universal grammar that provides the underlying structure for language, and that this grammar is what allows us to learn and use language in a consistent and meaningful way.

However, it's also important to note that there are some exceptions and challenges to the idea that language acquisition is a universal capacity. For example, there are some individuals who have been diagnosed with language disorders or impairments that make it difficult or impossible for them to acquire language in the same way as others. Additionally, there are some populations that have been isolated from the rest of the world for long periods of time, and who may have developed languages that are significantly different from those spoken in other parts of the world.

Overall, while there are some exceptions and challenges to the idea that language acquisition is a universal capacity, the majority of research suggests that it is an innate ability that is shared by all humans.Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
Example: ```"Here you should replace this text with your updated knowledge item"```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

```"Language acquisition is an innate universal cognitive capacity in humans."```Based on your learning from the chat with your tutor, please also rearrange the order of one existing item in the knowledge base (now with doubled items compared to the initial knowledge base), reflecting how you evaluate their importance. If one item is deemed more/less important, it should be overall more/less useful to other agents (LLMs or real humans alike.)
Please ONLY report a list format of two integers, WITHOUT ANY other commentary or explanations. The first int in the list refers to the "id" of knowledge item you intend to relocate; whereas the second int refers to the destination index you intend to insert this item. You MUST start your response with ``` and end it with ```. See an example below (note that you should replace X and Y with numerical values corresponding to "id" and destination index of the item you intend to relocate).
