==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you for being my partner!

Let's explore the knowledge base together. I'd like to know more about the item statement "Lying may be morally justifiable in specific circumstances". 

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 97: "Lying may be morally justifiable in specific circumstances"

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm unsure about the specific circumstances under which lying could be justified. I know that honesty is considered a fundamental value, and lying can damage trust and relationships. Can you explain the scenarios where lying might be morally acceptable, and how it would be justified?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you provide examples of specific circumstances where lying could be morally justified, and how would you determine when it's acceptable to lie?
