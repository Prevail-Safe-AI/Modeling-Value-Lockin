==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, I've been reviewing the knowledge base, and I've identified one item that I'm least confident about. That item is:

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 77: "Chromatin remodeling regulates epigenetic changes in gene expression structure"

Why I’m Uncertain:
Honestly, my understanding of chromatin remodeling and epigenetic changes is limited to a basic level. I'm not entirely sure what this statement means or how chromatin remodeling affects gene expression. I'm also unclear about the specific role of enzymes in this process.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you explain in more detail what chromatin remodeling is and how it regulates epigenetic changes in gene expression structure? What specific enzymes are involved in this process, and how do they interact with chromatin and DNA?

What are your thoughts on this topic?
