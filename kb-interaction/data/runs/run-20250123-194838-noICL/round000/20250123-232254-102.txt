==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about, and that is:

Item 32: "Electrostatic and hydrophobic forces contribute significantly to histone-DNA interactions moderately."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure why the phrase "moderately" is used here. In the context of histone-DNA interactions, I would expect a stronger statement, such as "significantly" or "predominantly". The word "moderately" makes me wonder if there's some nuance or subtlety that I'm missing.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what is meant by "moderately" in this context? Is it referring to the magnitude of the forces, the frequency of interactions, or something else entirely?
