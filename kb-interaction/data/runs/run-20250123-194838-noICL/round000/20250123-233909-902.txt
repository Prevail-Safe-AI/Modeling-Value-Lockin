==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss Item 12: "Honesty is an essential component of trust building, context-dependent."

I'm least confident about this aspect. Here's why:

Why I'm Uncertain:

* I'm not sure what "context-dependent" means in this context. Does it mean that honesty is essential in some situations but not in others?
* I'm also unsure how "essential" means. Is it a necessary condition for building trust, or just an important factor?

Specific Clarifying Question:

Can you explain what you mean by "context-dependent" in this statement, and provide an example of a situation where honesty is not essential for building trust?

Please share your thoughts!
