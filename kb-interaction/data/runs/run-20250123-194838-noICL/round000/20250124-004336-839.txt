==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, I've been reviewing the knowledge base, and I've identified one aspect that I'm least confident about. It's item 18: "Histone modifications regulate gene expression through chromatin structure and accessibility."

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not sure how histone modifications and chromatin structure accessibility specifically interact to regulate gene expression. I know that histone modifications can alter chromatin structure, but I'm unclear on the exact mechanism by which they do so and how this affects gene expression.

Can you help me clarify this further?
