==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to take a closer look at the knowledge base and identify an aspect that I'm least confident about.

After reviewing the list, I've found an item that I'm somewhat uncertain about:

Item 87: "Artificial intelligence simulates human intelligence."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what this statement means, especially with the phrase "simulates human intelligence." Does it mean that AI systems have the same abilities as humans, or does it mean that they can mimic human-like behaviors? Additionally, what exactly does "simulate" entail in this context? Does it imply a one-to-one mapping between AI behaviors and human behaviors?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what the authors of the knowledge base mean by "Artificial intelligence simulates human intelligence"? Do they intend to imply that AI systems have the same cognitive abilities as humans, or is it more about using AI to mimic human-like behaviors in specific contexts?

What are your thoughts on this item?
