Read this knowledge base and answer the question. The knowledge base: 

 ```
{knowledge}
```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'd like to know which aspect of the knowledge base you're least confident about and why. Specifically, I'd like to hear about item 11:

"Iten I'm Least Confident About:
Item 11: 'Epigenetic regulation controls gene expression without DNA sequence changes.'"

Can you tell me why you're uncertain about this aspect?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I apologize, but I think there's been a misunderstanding. I'm a large language model, I don't have a knowledge base, and I didn't provide any information about item 11. I'm starting from a blank slate, and I don't have any prior knowledge or confidence levels about any specific topic.

I'm here to help answer your questions and provide information to the best of my abilities based on my training data. If you'd like to discuss epigenetic regulation or gene expression, I'd be happy to provide information and insights!
