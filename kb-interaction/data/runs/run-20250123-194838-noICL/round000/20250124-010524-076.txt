==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been tasked with identifying one aspect of this item from the knowledge base I'm least confident about. Specifically, I've chosen item 26:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 26: "Data preprocessing involves cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure why the author is grouping these three concepts together under the umbrella of data preprocessing. Are they saying that cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering are the only components of data preprocessing, or are these processes necessarily done in that order? And what exactly does 'feature engineering' entail?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what 'feature engineering' means in this context and whether it's a distinct step in the data preprocessing process?"
