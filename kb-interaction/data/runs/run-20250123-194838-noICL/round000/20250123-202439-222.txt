==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd love to discuss the knowledge base we have. I'd like to focus on a specific item that I'm not entirely confident about. It's item 15: "Time dilation occurs due to special & general relativity".

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 15: "Time dilation occurs due to special & general relativity"

Why I’m Uncertain:

I'm not sure why time dilation occurs only due to special and general relativity. Is it because of the way massive objects bend spacetime, affecting the passage of time? Or is it more complex than that?

Specific Clarifying Question:

Can you please explain the relationship between time dilation and relativity in more detail? For example, are there any scenarios where time dilation occurs outside of these two theories?
