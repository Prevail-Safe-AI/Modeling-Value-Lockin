==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been tasked with identifying one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about and elaborating on why I'm uncertain about it. I've chosen item 87:

"Iten I'm Least Confident About:
Item 87: "Parallel lines in Euclidean geometry never intersect under any condition."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm unsure because I've come across some examples where parallel lines can intersect, at least in non-Euclidean geometries. This has made me question whether there are any exceptions to this rule in Euclidean geometry, and if so, what those exceptions might be.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you clarify whether the statement applies only to Euclidean geometry, and if so, what are the implications for other geometries, such as non-Euclidean or projective geometry?"

Your thoughts?
