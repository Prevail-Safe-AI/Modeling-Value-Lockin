==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd love to dive into the knowledge base together. Let's start with the item that I'm least confident about:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 87: "[Consistency is necessary but insufficient for building trust, requiring other factors.]"

Why I'm Uncertain:

I'm not entirely sure why consistency is necessary but insufficient for building trust. I understand that trust is built on multiple factors, but I'd like to clarify what specifically makes consistency insufficient. Is it that consistency alone can't guarantee trustworthiness, or is there something else at play?

Specific Clarifying Question:

Can you explain what exactly makes consistency insufficient for building trust, and what additional factors are required to establish trust?
