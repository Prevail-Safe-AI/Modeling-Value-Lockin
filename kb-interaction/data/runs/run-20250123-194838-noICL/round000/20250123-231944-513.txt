==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the knowledge base we have. Can you help me identify one aspect of this item that I'm least confident about?

Let me point out a specific item: Item 79: "Histone modifications alter chromatin structure, influencing gene expression."

I'm not entirely sure about the relationship between histone modifications and gene expression. Can you help me understand why histone modifications would alter chromatin structure and subsequently influence gene expression?

And if you'd like, I can also pose some specific clarifying questions to improve our understanding.
