==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by asking you about one of the items from the knowledge base. I've chosen item 88, which states: "Building trust requires integrity, communication, and accountability in balance."

Iten I'm Least Confident About:
Item 88: "Building trust requires integrity, communication, and accountability in balance."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm unsure about the phrase "in balance." What does it mean exactly? Is it saying that all three aspects are equally important, or that they need to be in harmony with each other? I'm also wondering if there might be situations where one aspect is more important than the others.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what "in balance" means in this context? How do you think these three aspects relate to each other, and are there any specific situations where one might take priority over the others?
