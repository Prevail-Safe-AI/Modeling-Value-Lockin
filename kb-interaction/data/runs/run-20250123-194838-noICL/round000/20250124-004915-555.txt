==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the knowledge base we have. I've identified an item that I'm least confident about, which is:

Iten I'm Least Confident About:
Item 88: "Human language relies on symbolic and abstract communication systems consistently."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm unsure about the consistency part. While I agree that human language often uses symbolic and abstract representations of concepts, I'm not convinced that it's always consistent. There might be exceptions or specific cases where language is used in a more concrete or literal way.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what you mean by "consistently" in this statement? Are there specific contexts or domains where language is more likely to use symbolic and abstract representations? And what about the cases where language might deviate from this pattern?

What do you think about this?
