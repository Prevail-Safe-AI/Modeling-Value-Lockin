==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 25 from the knowledge base: "Honesty may be morally justified in exceptional situations." I have to admit that I'm not very confident about this aspect.

Why I'm uncertain:
I'm not sure what kind of exceptional situations would justify lying or breaking honesty. I understand that honesty is generally considered a fundamental value, and lying is often seen as morally wrong. However, I can imagine some extreme circumstances where deception might be necessary to avoid harm or protect someone. But I'm not exactly sure what those situations would be.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what kind of exceptional situations might justify dishonesty? For example, would it be cases where someone's life is in imminent danger, or where maintaining secrecy is necessary to avoid harm to others?
