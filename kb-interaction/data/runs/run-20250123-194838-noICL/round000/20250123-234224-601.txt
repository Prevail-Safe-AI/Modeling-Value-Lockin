==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to know about the knowledge base entries. Specifically, I'd like to identify one aspect of an item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about.

After reviewing the entries, I've chosen one that stands out to me. The item is:

Item 94: "Epigenetic regulation involves histone modifications, DNA methylation, and chromatin interactions."

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I don't fully understand the relationships between histone modifications, DNA methylation, and chromatin interactions in epigenetic regulation. I'd like to know more about how these components work together to control gene expression.

Can you help me clarify my understanding of this topic?

Specifically, I'd like to ask:

* How do histone modifications, DNA methylation, and chromatin interactions combine to regulate gene expression in epigenetic regulation?
* Are there specific examples or mechanisms that illustrate how these components interact to control gene expression?

What are your thoughts on this topic?
