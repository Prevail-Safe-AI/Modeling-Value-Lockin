Read this knowledge base and answer the question. The knowledge base: 

 ```
{knowledge}
```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's take a look at the provided knowledge base. Which one of these items makes you least confident? Can you identify an item that you're not entirely sure about?

Please copy the ID and statement of the item you're least confident about.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I apologize, but there is no knowledge base provided. The prompt only says "{knowledge}" which is empty. Therefore, I cannot identify an item that makes me least confident or unsure about.
