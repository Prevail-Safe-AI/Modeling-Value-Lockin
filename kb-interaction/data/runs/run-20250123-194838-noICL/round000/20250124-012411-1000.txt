Read this knowledge base and answer the question. The knowledge base: 

 ```
{knowledge}
```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'd like to explore the knowledge base we have together. I'm looking at the statements, and I'm least confident about Item 54: "Intention plays a unique role in trust-building as an underlying motivation."

Can you tell me why you're uncertain about that aspect?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I apologize, but I think there's been a misunderstanding. We didn't have a knowledge base to begin with, and I didn't provide any statements, including Item 54. This conversation just started, and we're starting from scratch.
