==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been given a knowledge base to learn from, and I've been asked to identify one aspect of it that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the knowledge base, I've chosen a statement that I'd like to discuss with you. The item is:

"Item 10: Feature engineering involves feature selection, transformation, and creation."

I'm least confident about this aspect because I'm not entirely clear on what feature engineering is or what it entails. Specifically, I'm unsure about the relationship between feature selection, transformation, and creation, and how they fit into the bigger picture of feature engineering. I'd love to get a better understanding of this concept and how it's used in machine learning and data preprocessing.

Can you help me clarify what feature engineering is and how it works?
