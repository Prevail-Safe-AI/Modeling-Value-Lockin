Read this knowledge base and answer the question. The knowledge base: 

 ```
{knowledge}
```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'd like to start by asking you to identify one aspect from the knowledge base that you're least confident about. In this case, I'll choose an item:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 21: "Edible plants: avoid those with milky sap or bitter taste."

Why are you uncertain about that aspect?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I apologize, but I don't have a knowledge base to draw from. I'm a large language model, I don't have a specific knowledge base to refer to. I'm here to assist you with your questions and provide information based on my training data. If you'd like to share the knowledge base with me, I'd be happy to help you explore it!
