==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying one aspect of this knowledge base that I'm least confident about. And, after reviewing the statements, I've chosen item:

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 63: "Epigenetic regulation involves complex interactions between chromatin remodeling, histone modification, and DNA methylation."

Why I’m Uncertain:
To be honest, I'm not entirely sure how these three mechanisms interact with each other or how they specifically contribute to epigenetic regulation. As a beginner in this field, my understanding is limited to the broad concept that epigenetic regulation can influence gene expression, but the details are fuzzy.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you explain how these three mechanisms (chromatin remodeling, histone modification, and DNA methylation) interact with each other and their role in epigenetic regulation? For example, do any of these mechanisms have a primary function, and how do they influence gene expression?

Your thoughts?
