==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

According to our knowledge base, I was asked to identify an item that I'm least confident about, and then elaborate on why I'm uncertain about it and formulate specific clarifying questions to improve my understanding.

I've chosen Item 24, which states: "Moral absolutism can be nuanced and context-dependent in practice."

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not entirely sure what differences there are between moral absolutism and moral relativism. I understand that moral absolutism is the idea that certain actions are always right or wrong, regardless of the situation, whereas moral relativism suggests that morality is subjective and varies depending on the culture, time, or situation. But I'm not confident in my understanding of how moral absolutism can be nuanced and context-dependent in practice.

Can you help me clarify this concept?
