==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I've been reading through it, and I've identified one aspect that I'm least confident about. It's item 97:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 97: 'Honesty necessary, but insufficient, for trust in complex situations'"

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm unsure about how to apply this statement to real-life situations. I understand that honesty is important, but I'm not confident in how to distinguish between situations where honesty is the most important factor and situations where other factors may also contribute to building trust.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain or provide an example of how honesty might be both necessary and insufficient for trust in complex situations? For instance, what are some scenarios where other factors like reliability, consistency, or vulnerability might also play a crucial role in building trust?

What are your thoughts?
