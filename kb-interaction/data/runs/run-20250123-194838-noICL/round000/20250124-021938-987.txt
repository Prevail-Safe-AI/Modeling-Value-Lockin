==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been given a knowledge base with a series of statements, and I've been asked to analyze one of them in particular, which is:

```
{
  "id": 77,
  "statement": "Data engineering involves designing, building, and maintaining scalable data systems."
}
```

I'm supposed to identify one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. However, I'm not sure what to say because the statement seems pretty straightforward to me.

So, I'd like to ask you: Are you familiar with the term "data engineering"? Do you think there's any nuance or complexity to it that I might be missing?
