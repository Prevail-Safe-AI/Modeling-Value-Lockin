==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm analyzing the knowledge base, and I've identified one aspect that I'm least confident about. It's item 1:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 1: "Histones interact with DNA through electrostatic, hydrophobic, and hydrogen bonds."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what "hydrophobic" refers to in this context. Is it a type of bond that holds histones and DNA together? If so, how does it work? And are there any other factors besides electrostatic and hydrogen bonds that contribute to histone-DNA interactions?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what "hydrophobic" means in the context of histone-DNA interactions, and how it plays a role in stabilizing their connection?"
