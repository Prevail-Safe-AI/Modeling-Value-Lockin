==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been tasked with identifying one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the item:

{
"id": 14,
"statement": "Honesty sets foundation but requires consistency, communication, understanding."
}

I'm a bit uncertain about the phrase "requires communication". I'm not quite clear on how communication fits into the need for trust building. Could you help me understand what's meant by this phrase?

Specifically, what kind of communication is required for building trust? Is it just about sharing information, or is there something more to it?
