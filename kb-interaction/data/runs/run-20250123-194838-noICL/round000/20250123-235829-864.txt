==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been given a knowledge base, and I've identified an item that I'm least confident about. The item is:

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 80: "Trust building involves reliability, consistency, and open communication."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not sure if this is an exhaustive list of factors involved in trust building. I feel that there might be other important aspects that are not mentioned here.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what you mean by "open communication" in the context of trust building? Is it just about being honest and transparent, or are there other important communication principles involved as well?

Please let me know your thoughts!
