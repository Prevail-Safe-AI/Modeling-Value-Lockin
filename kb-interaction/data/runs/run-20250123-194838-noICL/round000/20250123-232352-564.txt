==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to focus on the aspect of the knowledge base I'm least confident about. According to the knowledge base, one such item is:

Item 63: "Honesty is a necessary condition, but not sufficient, trust."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely clear about what "necessary condition" and "sufficient" mean in this context. I understand that honesty is important for building trust, but I'm not sure how it fits into the requirements for trust.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you explain what it means for honesty to be a "necessary condition" for trust, but not "sufficient" condition? How does this concept apply to real-life situations?

Can you help me understand this concept better?
