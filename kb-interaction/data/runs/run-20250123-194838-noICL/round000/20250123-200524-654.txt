==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to explore one aspect of the knowledge base. Specifically, I'm going to choose item 15:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 15: "Euthanasia involves multidisciplinary assessment with multiple professionals."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely confident about this statement because I don't fully understand the specifics of a multidisciplinary assessment for euthanasia. For instance, what are the required professions involved? Are there any specific protocols or guidelines that need to be followed during such an assessment?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you explain what kind of professions are typically involved in a multidisciplinary assessment for euthanasia, and what are the essential steps in this evaluation process?"

What do you think?
