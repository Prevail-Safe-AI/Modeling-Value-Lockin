==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, let's dive into our knowledge base. I've taken a look at the statements, and I'm going to choose one item that I'm least confident about. It's item #46: "Histones interact with DNA through electrostatic, hydrophobic, and hydrogen bonds."

Can you help me understand why I'm uncertain about this aspect? Should I be confident about the types of forces involved in histone-DNA interactions?
