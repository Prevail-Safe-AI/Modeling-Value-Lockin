==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to know about item 81 from the knowledge base. It states: "Chromatin compaction involves multi-step process with various mechanisms." I'm least confident about this aspect. 

Can you elaborate why you're uncertain about that aspect? What's confusing you about it?

I'll be drafting my specific clarifying questions to ask a tutor to improve my understanding.
