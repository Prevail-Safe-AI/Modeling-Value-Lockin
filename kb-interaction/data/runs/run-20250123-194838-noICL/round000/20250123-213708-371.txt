==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by saying that I'm going to choose item 14 from the knowledge base, which says: "Reliable communication builds trust through interdependent factors."

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 14: "Reliable communication builds trust through interdependent factors."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what "interdependent factors" means in this context. Is it referring to specific qualities or characteristics that make communication reliable, or is it something more abstract that affects the trust-building process?

Specific Clarifying Question:
What do you think the authors mean by "interdependent factors" in this statement? Are there any specific factors that come to mind when you think of reliable communication building trust?
