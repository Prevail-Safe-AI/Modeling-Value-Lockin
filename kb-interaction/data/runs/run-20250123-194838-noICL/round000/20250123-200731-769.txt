Read this knowledge base and answer the question. The knowledge base: 

 ```
{knowledge}
```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'd like to know about the knowledge base we have. Specifically, I'd like to ask you about Item 94, which states "The speed of light is the same for all observers, according to special relativity."

I am the least confident about this item.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I apologize, but it seems that we don't have a knowledge base, and I didn't receive any information about Item 94. It's possible that we're starting from scratch!

However, I can tell you that the statement "The speed of light is the same for all observers, according to special relativity" is indeed a fundamental concept in physics. According to Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity, the speed of light (approximately 186,282 miles per second) is a universal constant that is the same for all observers, regardless of their relative motion or position. This concept has been extensively tested and confirmed through numerous scientific experiments and observations.

If you'd like to discuss this topic further or clarify any doubts you may have, I'm here to help!
