==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base! I've selected one item that I'm least confident about, and it's:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 38: "Neural oscillations can vary in frequency ranges, including alpha, beta, theta."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm uncertain about this item because I'm not entirely clear on what alpha, beta, and theta waves refer to, specifically in the context of neural oscillations. I know that neural oscillations are important for various cognitive processes, but I'd like to understand more about these specific frequency ranges and how they relate to consciousness and brain activity.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what alpha, beta, and theta waves represent in terms of neural oscillations, and how they are related to consciousness and cognitive processes? Are there any specific studies or research that support the idea that neural oscillations in these frequency ranges are important for certain cognitive functions?
