==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I think I'd like to start by identifying one aspect of our knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the statements, I'm going to choose:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 59: "Honesty is a necessary but insufficient condition for trust building."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm unsure about what exactly constitutes "insufficient" in this statement. Is it that honesty alone cannot guarantee trust, or is it that there are other factors that need to be present in addition to honesty for trust to be built? Additionally, I'm unclear about the nuances of trust building and what other conditions are required for it to occur.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you elaborate on what you mean by "insufficient" and provide some examples of situations where honesty alone is not enough to build trust?
