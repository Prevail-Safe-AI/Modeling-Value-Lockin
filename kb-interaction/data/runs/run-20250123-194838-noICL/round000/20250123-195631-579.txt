I am your partner. Please start the conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's go through the task together. We're asked to identify an item from the knowledge base that we're least confident about.

After scanning the knowledge base, I've identified Item 90 as one aspect I'm least confident about. The item states:

"{ 'id': 90, 'statement': 'Prime number theorem describes distribution of primes among integers.' }"

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I don't fully understand the prime number theorem and how it relates to the distribution of primes among integers. I'm not sure what specific Distribution it refers to or what types of integers are being considered.

Can you help me clarify this aspect?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'm happy to help you clarify this aspect.

The Prime Number Theorem (PNT) is a fundamental result in number theory that describes the distribution of prime numbers among the positive integers. It states that the number of prime numbers less than or equal to x (denoted as π(x)) grows like x / ln(x) as x approaches infinity.

In simpler terms, the PNT says that the distribution of prime numbers among integers is asymptotically equal to the number of integers up to x divided by the natural logarithm of x.

The "distribution" referred to in the statement is the way prime numbers are scattered among the positive integers. The PNT provides a precise estimate of the number of prime numbers less than or equal to x, which helps us understand how prime numbers are distributed among the integers.

The PNT is often used in number theory and cryptography to study the properties of prime numbers and their applications in various fields.

Regarding the types of integers being considered, the PNT is typically applied to the set of positive integers, which includes all integers greater than zero.

I hope this helps clarify the aspect! Do you have any further questions or concerns?Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
