==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been going through our knowledge base, and I'd like to know more about the item "Histones bind to DNA through multiple forces, including van der Waals" (id: 79).

I'm least confident about this aspect because I'm not entirely sure what van der Waals forces are and how they interact with histones and DNA. Could you elaborate on that?

Can you help me understand what these forces are and how they contribute to the binding of histones to DNA?

Please help me clarify any doubts I have about this topic.
