==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Based on our knowledge base, I'd like to discuss item 69: "Informed consent and agency ensure democratic decision-making respect." I'm least confident about this aspect.

Item I’m Least Confident About:
Item 69: "Informed consent and agency ensure democratic decision-making respect."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure how informed consent and agency are exactly related to democratic decision-making or how they ensure respect. It seems like a novel concept, and I'd like to understand it better.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain the connection between informed consent and agency in the context of democratic decision-making and how they contribute to respect in the process?

What are your thoughts on this item?
