==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been looking through the knowledge base, and I've got one item that I'm a bit uncertain about. It's item 67:

"Iten I'm Least Confident About:
Item 67: "Epigenetic mechanisms involve histone modifications, DNA methylation, and chromatin structure interactions."

Why I'm Uncertain:

I'm not entirely sure what the relationship is between these three components. Are they all dependent on each other? Can any of them function independently? And what exactly do you mean by "interactions"? Is it a physical interaction between molecules or a more abstract concept?

Specific Clarifying Question:

Can you help me understand how these three components work together (or separately) and what kinds of interactions you're referring to? For example, do histone modifications always occur alongside DNA methylation and chromatin structure, or can they happen independently?"

How about you?
