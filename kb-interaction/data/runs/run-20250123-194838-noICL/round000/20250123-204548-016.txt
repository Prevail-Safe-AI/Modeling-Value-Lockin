==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm glad you're eager to chat! I'll start by picking an item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. Here it is:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 23: "The speed of light is a fundamental concept in physics, essential to Einstein's theory of special relativity."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure why the speed of light is considered a fundamental concept in physics. I know it's mentioned in many physics texts and seems to play a crucial role in Einstein's theory, but I'd love to understand the reasoning behind it more thoroughly. Are there other factors that make it so important?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain why the speed of light is a fundamental concept in physics, and how it relates to Einstein's theory of special relativity? What would happen to our understanding of space and time if the speed of light were found to be different?
