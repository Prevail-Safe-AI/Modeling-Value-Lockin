==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'll take the item from the list that I'm least confident about, and we can discuss it together.

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 43: "Superposition enables wave-particle duality through wave function collapse."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm unsure about the relationship between wave function collapse and wave-particle duality. Is wave function collapse a necessary condition for wave-particle duality to occur?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain why wave function collapse is linked to wave-particle duality, and how it affects the behavior of particles in quantum systems?

Your thoughts?
