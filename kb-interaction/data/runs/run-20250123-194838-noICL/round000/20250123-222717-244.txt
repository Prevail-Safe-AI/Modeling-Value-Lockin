==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the knowledge base we have. I've been reviewing it, and I'm noticing that there are many statements about histones and DNA interactions, as well as statements about honesty and trust.

One aspect that I'm least confident about is the item:

"Item 14: Histones interact with DNA primarily through electrostatic forces."

I'm uncertain about this because I'm not entirely sure how histones and DNA interact, and what other types of forces might also be at play. I'd like to know more about the specific mechanisms and forces involved in this interaction.

Can you elaborate on why you think histones interact with DNA primarily through electrostatic forces?
