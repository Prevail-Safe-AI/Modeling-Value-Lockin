==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been reviewing the knowledge base and I wanted to discuss one item that has left me a bit uncertain. It's item 90:

"Building trust requires honesty, reliability, and open communication."

I'm not entirely sure about this statement because it seems oversimplified. Trust is a complex concept that involves many factors, and I'm not convinced that honesty, reliability, and open communication are sufficient conditions for building trust.

Can you elaborate on why you think these three factors are essential for building trust?

Also, what kind of situations or scenarios do you think these factors would be particularly important in?
