==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, I've been reviewing the knowledge base we've been given, and I noticed that one aspect of epistemology and neural oscillations that caught my attention was the role of neural oscillations and synchronization in consciousness. Specifically, the statement: 

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 91: 'Neural oscillations and synchronization play crucial role in consciousness.'"

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm unsure about how exactly neural oscillations and synchronization contribute to the emergence of consciousness. I'm not confident in my understanding of the neural mechanisms that enable consciousness.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me clarify how neural oscillations and synchronization work together to create conscious experience? Are there specific studies or findings that support this role in consciousness?
