==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Excited to dive into the knowledge base. I'm going to ask about item 96, which reads: "Histone modification and DNA methylation regulate chromatin structure."

Item I’m Least Confident About:
Item 96: "Histone modification and DNA methylation regulate chromatin structure."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure how histone modification and DNA methylation specifically regulate chromatin structure. I understand that chromatin structure affects gene expression, and histone modifications can influence chromatin accessibility, but I'd like to know more about the direct relationship between histone modification, DNA methylation, and chromatin structure.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain the specific mechanisms by which histone modification and DNA methylation regulate chromatin structure, and how these modifications impact chromatin compaction and accessibility to transcription factors and histone-modifying enzymes?
