==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss one of the items from the knowledge base that I'm a bit uncertain about. It's item 98:

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 98: "Acknowledging efforts fosters trust and collaboration through recognition and validation"

Why I’m Uncertain:
To be honest, I'm not entirely sure what "recognition and validation" means in this context. Is it referring to explicit acknowledgment, such as saying "thank you" or recognizing someone's contributions publicly? Or is it more about implicit validation, like showing empathy or understanding through non-verbal cues?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what you mean by "recognition and validation" in this context? Are there specific examples or scenarios where acknowledging efforts through recognition and validation would be particularly effective for building trust and collaboration?

Let me know what you think!
