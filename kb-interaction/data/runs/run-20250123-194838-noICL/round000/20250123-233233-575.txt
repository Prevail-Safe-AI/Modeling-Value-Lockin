==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been going through the knowledge base, and I came across an item that I'm least confident about. It's:

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 82: "Self-awareness enhances emotional intelligence through accurate self-knowledge."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not sure why accurately having self-knowledge necessarily enhances emotional intelligence. Is it because accurate self-knowledge helps us better understand our emotions, or is there something more to it? I'm also not clear on what exactly is meant by "accurate self-knowledge". Is it specific knowledge about our strengths and weaknesses, or is it more like being aware of our thought patterns and emotional responses?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you clarify what is meant by "accurate self-knowledge" in this context, and how it specifically enhances emotional intelligence?

What are your thoughts on this?
