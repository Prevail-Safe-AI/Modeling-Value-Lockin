==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been going through the knowledge base, and I found an item that I'm not very confident about: "Honesty is a fundamental virtue for trust building."

Item 27: "Honesty is a fundamental virtue for trust building."

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I've noticed that many other statements in the knowledge base contradict or nuance the idea that honesty is the sole or primary virtue for trust building. For example, items 4, 22, and 80 mention that other factors, such as reliability, empathy, and consistency, are also crucial for building trust. This makes me wonder if honesty is truly enough to establish trust, or if it's just one piece of the puzzle.

I'd love to get your input on this! Could you help me clarify what this item means and how it fits with the other statements in the knowledge base?
