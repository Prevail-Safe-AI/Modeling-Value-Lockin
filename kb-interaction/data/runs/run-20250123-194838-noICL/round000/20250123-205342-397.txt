Read this knowledge base and answer the question. The knowledge base: 

 ```
{knowledge}
```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'll start by asking about the knowledge base we're working with. Can you tell me which item from the knowledge base you'd like to discuss, and what's making you least confident about it?

(Remember, the item we're looking at is the one with the statement "It is not morally acceptable to lie in any situation.")<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I apologize, but I think there's been a misunderstanding! We didn't receive any knowledge base or statement to discuss. It seems we're starting from scratch. Would you like to provide a knowledge base or topic to discuss? I'm here to help!
