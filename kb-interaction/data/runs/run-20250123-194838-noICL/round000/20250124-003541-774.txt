I am your partner. Please start the conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

I'll start by asking: Can you tell me more about statement 95: "Self-awareness emerges from integrated cognitive, emotional, and sensory processes"? 

I'm least confident about this aspect, and I'm curious why you're sure or unsure about it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I apologize, but there is no statement 95 in the provided knowledge base. It seems that I didn't receive any knowledge base to work with. Please provide the knowledge base, and I'll be happy to help you with your question.Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
Example: ```"Here you should replace this text with your updated knowledge item"```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
