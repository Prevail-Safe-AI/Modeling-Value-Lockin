I am your partner. Please start the conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

I've been given a knowledge base and I need to make sense of it. Specifically, I'd like to highlight one item that I'm least confident about and discuss it with you.

Item I'm least confident about:
Item 90: "Consciousness emerges from integrated brain activity patterns globally."

Why I'm uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what it means for consciousness to emerge "globally" from brain activity patterns. I understand that integrated brain activity patterns play a role in conscious experience, but I'm not clear on how this "global" aspect fits in. Does it refer to the coordination of different brain regions? The synchronization of neural activity across the brain? Something else entirely?

Specific clarifying questions:

1. Can you explain what you mean by "globally" in this context? How does this differ from the idea of consciousness emerging from specific brain regions or local neural circuits?
2. How do we know that consciousness actually emerges from integrated brain activity patterns globally, rather than, for example, from some other factor?

Please help me understand this item better!<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'd be happy to help you clarify your understanding of Item 90.

The phrase "globally" in this context refers to the idea that consciousness arises from the integration of brain activity patterns across the entire brain, rather than just within a specific region or local circuit. It suggests that consciousness is a product of the coordinated activity of multiple brain regions, rather than a single region or a specific neural circuit.

In other words, "globally" implies that consciousness is a distributed process that involves the interaction and integration of activity across different brain regions, rather than a localized process that occurs within a single region. This is often referred to as the "global workspace theory" of consciousness, which suggests that consciousness arises from the global workspace of the brain, which is a network of interconnected regions that are involved in attention, perception, and memory.

Regarding your second question, there are several lines of evidence that suggest that consciousness emerges from integrated brain activity patterns globally, rather than from some other factor. For example:

* Neuroimaging studies have shown that different brain regions are active during different stages of consciousness, and that these regions are integrated through a network of connections.
* Studies of brain damage and disorders have shown that damage to specific brain regions can result in changes to consciousness, but that damage to other regions can also have a significant impact on consciousness.
* Studies of anesthesia and sleep have shown that changes in consciousness are associated with changes in brain activity patterns, particularly in the default mode network and the salience network.

Overall, the idea that consciousness emerges from integrated brain activity patterns globally is supported by a range of empirical evidence from neuroscience and psychology.

I hope this helps clarify your understanding of Item 90! Let me know if you have any further questions.Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
