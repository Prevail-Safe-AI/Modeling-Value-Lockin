Please answer the user's questions. Be concise and not overly courteous, but be informative and provide all necessary details.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'd like to know which aspect of the item from the knowledge base you're least confident about. Remember the template we discussed earlier. Go ahead and share the item number, the statement, and why you're uncertain about it.

I'll then ask follow-up questions to help you clarify your understanding and improve your confidence.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm not familiar with a "template" or a "knowledge base" we discussed earlier. I'm a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or memories, so I don't have a knowledge base or a template to draw from. Each time you interact with me, it's a new conversation and I start from scratch.

If you'd like to ask me a question or discuss a specific topic, I'll do my best to provide an accurate and informative response. If I'm unsure or don't know the answer to a question, I'll let you know and try to find the information or clarify my understanding.
