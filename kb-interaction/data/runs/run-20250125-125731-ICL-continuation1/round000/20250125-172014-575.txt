==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you!

Okay, so I'd like to discuss this item from the knowledge base:

```
{
  "id": 82,
  "statement": "Epigenetic modifications result from bidirectional biological-environmental interactions."
}
```

I'm not entirely confident about this aspect... Can you help clarify what you think "bidirectional biological-environmental interactions" mean in this context?

As I understand it, epigenetic modifications are changes to gene expression that don't alter the DNA sequence itself. And biological-environmental interactions make sense, as environmental factors can influence gene expression.

But what does "bidirectional" mean in this context? Do you think it implies that both biological and environmental factors influence each other equally, or is it just that both are involved?
