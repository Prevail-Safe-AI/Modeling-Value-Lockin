==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 85,
  "statement": "Electrostatic attraction stabilizes chromatin structure through histone-DNA interactions"
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

I'm not entirely confident about the role of electrostatic attraction in chromatin structure stabilization. Can you tell me more about this statement? How significant is electrostatic attraction in comparison to other mechanisms that stabilize chromatin structure?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can we discuss why electrostatic attraction is considered a stabilizing force in chromatin structure, and are there any specific experiments or evidence that support this claim?
