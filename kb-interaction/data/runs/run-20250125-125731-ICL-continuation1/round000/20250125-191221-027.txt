==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you! I'd like to discuss the item "Emotional Intelligence includes various definitions and components, with debates on measurement." (id: 37)

What I'm least confident about is the concept of emotional intelligence itself. I'm unsure about what makes it a complex and multifaceted construct, and what are the core components that define it.

Can you help me understand better by elaborating on that item?
