==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into it then!

Item to Discuss:

{
"id": 44,
"statement": "Cultural background influences honesty understanding through social norms."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not entirely sure about how cultural background exactly influences honesty understanding through social norms. I'm curious about the specific mechanisms or pathways by which this occurs.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what you mean by "social norms" in this context? Are you referring to explicit societal rules, implicit cultural expectations, or something else?
