==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to know more about the item "Epigenetic changes influence gene expression, disease susceptibility, and treatment outcomes." Specifically, I'm least confident about the relationship between epigenetic changes and treatment outcomes.

I'm unsure about how epigenetic changes can specifically influence treatment outcomes, such as the effectiveness of a particular medication or the success of a therapy. Can you help me understand this better?

Also, what specific mechanisms or pathways would you say are involved in epigenetic changes influencing treatment outcomes?
