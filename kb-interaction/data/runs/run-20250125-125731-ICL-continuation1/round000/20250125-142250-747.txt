==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm going to choose item 80 which states that "Honesty development involves complex biological, psychological, and social interplay." I'm unsure about this item because I'm not entirely convinced that honesty can be reduced to just three factors: biological, psychological, and social. I feel that there might be other aspects that contribute to the development of honesty, and I'd like to know more about what specifically is meant by these three factors.

Can you please elaborate on what you think is meant by "complex biological, psychological, and social interplay"? What are some specific examples or evidence that support this idea?
