==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's get started!

I've been asked to identify one aspect from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about, and I've chosen item 41:

{
"id": 41,
"statement": "Non-coding RNAs regulate gene expression through histone and DNA interactions."
}

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I don't have a clear understanding of how non-coding RNAs can directly interact with histones and DNA to regulate gene expression. I know that non-coding RNAs play a role in gene regulation, but I'm not familiar with the specific mechanisms involved in this process.

Can you help me clarify this concept?
