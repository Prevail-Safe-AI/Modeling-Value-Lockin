==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll choose an item from the knowledge base and we can go from there.

I've chosen item 8:
```
{
  "id": 8,
  "statement": "Epigenetic modifications alter chromatin structure to regulate gene expression."
}
```

I'm least confident about the specific mechanism by which epigenetic modifications change chromatin structure to regulate gene expression. I'll admit that the connection between epigenetic modifications, chromatin structure, and gene expression is a bit unclear to me.

Could you elaborate on why you think epigenetic modifications alter chromatin structure to regulate gene expression? What are some specific examples of how this happens?
