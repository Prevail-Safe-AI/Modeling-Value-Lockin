==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've chosen item #14 from the knowledge base for discussion. The statement is: "Epigenetic marks form from complex biological-chemical-environmental interactions."

I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect. I'd like to know more about what's meant by "complex biological-chemical-environmental interactions." Can you elaborate on what these interactions actually are and how they influence epigenetic mark formation?

What specific factors or mechanisms come into play? Are there any key players, such as enzymes, hormones, or other molecules, that play a crucial role in shaping epigenetic marks?
