==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been given a task to identify an aspect of the item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about, and then elaborate why I'm uncertain about it and formulate specific clarifying questions to ask a tutor to improve my understanding.

Looking at the item:

{
"id": 76,
"statement": "Chromatin domain is a functional unit for histone modification regulation"
}

I'm not confident about the concept of "Chromatin domain" as it's not entirely clear to me what this means and how it relates to histone modification regulation.

Can you help me understand this concept better?
