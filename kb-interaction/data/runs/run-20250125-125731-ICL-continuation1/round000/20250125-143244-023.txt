==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been going through the knowledge base and I came across item 73, which states: "Epigenetic modifications regulate chromatin accessibility influencing gene expression." I'm least confident about this aspect.

I'm uncertain about how epigenetic modifications actually regulate chromatin accessibility and how that, in turn, influences gene expression. I have a general understanding of epigenetics, but I'm not sure about the specific mechanisms involved in this process.

Can you help clarify this for me?
