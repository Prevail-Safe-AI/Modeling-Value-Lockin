==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 30,
"statement": "Genetic predispositions interact with multiple environmental factors to shape moral development."
}

I'm least confident about this aspect: it assumes that genetic predispositions have a significant influence on moral development. However, I'm unsure about the degree of influence and the specific mechanisms by which genetic predispositions interact with environmental factors.

Could you elaborate on why you're uncertain about that aspect?
