Thank you! I'll go ahead and start.

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 90,
  "statement": "Moral development arises from interplay of biological, psychological, social, and cultural factors"
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm a bit uncertain about how the different factors (biological, psychological, social, and cultural) interact with each other in moral development. I'm not sure if one domain dominates the others or if it's a complex interplay.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you help me understand the relative importance of each factor and how they influence moral development? Are there any concrete examples that illustrate the interplay between these factors?

Your turn!
