==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item. I'd like to discuss the one aspect that I'm least confident about, which is:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 14,
"statement": "Epigenetic inheritance intricate process, unclear mechanisms debated"
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm uncertain about what exactly makes epigenetic inheritance an "intricate process". I'd love to understand better what makes it complex and what factors contribute to this complexity.

Specific Clarifying Questions:
Can you help me understand what are the key mechanisms that make epigenetic inheritance an intricate process? What factors, such as biological, environmental, or genetic factors, play a role in this complexity?

Please feel free to elaborate on this topic, and I'll respond with more questions or clarification if needed!
