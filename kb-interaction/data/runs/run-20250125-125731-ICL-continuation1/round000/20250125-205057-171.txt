==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's discuss the item "Honesty may not be absolute in life-or-death emergencies." (Id 27)

I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect. I think it's because I wasn't fully satisfied with the reasoning behind why honesty might not be absolute in life-or-death emergencies. It seems like honesty is often considered a fundamental value in most situations, but this statement implies that there are exceptions to that. I'd like to understand more about what drives thisbelief.

Can you help me clarify what you think is meant by "absolute" in this context, and what kind of situations might lead to honesty not being the best choice?
