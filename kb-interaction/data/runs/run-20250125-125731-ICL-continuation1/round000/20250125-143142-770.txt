==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's get started!

The item we're discussing is:

{
"id": 23,
"statement": "Emotional validation acknowledges emotions as legitimate and natural human experiences."
}

I'd like to know what you think is the most important aspect of this statement. Is it the idea that emotions are "legitimate" or the fact that they're "natural human experiences"?

And to what extent do you think emotional validation is important in everyday life?
