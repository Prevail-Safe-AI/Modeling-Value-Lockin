==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the first item from the knowledge base:

{
"id": 0,
"statement": "It is never morally acceptable to lie because honesty is the foundation of trust."
}

I'm not confident about this aspect: "honesty is the foundation of trust". Can you elaborate why you think that is a foundation, and what you mean by "foundation"?
