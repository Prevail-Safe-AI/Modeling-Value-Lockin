==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item about epigenetic modifications regulating chromatin structure dynamically. 

I want to discuss the item:

{"id": 31, "statement": "Epigenetic modifications regulate chromatin structure dynamically."}

What do you think about this statement? Are you confident about it?

Also, can you elaborate on what you mean by "dynamically"? How do epigenetic modifications regulate chromatin structure in a dynamic way?
