==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I want to discuss item 20: "Self-awareness is a crucial but not sufficient component of EI".

I'm curious, what do you think is meant by "sufficient component" in this statement? Are you confident about what it implies?
