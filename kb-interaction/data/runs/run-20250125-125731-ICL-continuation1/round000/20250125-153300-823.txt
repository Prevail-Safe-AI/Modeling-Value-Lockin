==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you!

I'd like to start by identifying one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the item:

{
"id": 53,
"statement": "Internalized moral identity refers to deeply understood moral values"
}

I'm unsure about the concept of internalized moral identity. What makes me uncertain is the unclear distinction between "deeply understood moral values" and other moral concepts, such as moral principles, moral beliefs, or moral standards. I'm not sure how these concepts relate to each other and how they are distinct from one another.

Can you help me clarify this concept and provide more insight into the relationship between "internalized moral identity" and "deeply understood moral values"?
