==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by exploring the aspect of emotional intelligence. Let's focus on the item:

{
"id": 12,
"statement": "Emotional Intelligence involves self-awareness, empathy, regulation, motivation, and social skill."
}

I'm a bit uncertain about the relationship between self-awareness and motivation. The statement implies that motivation is one of the components of emotional intelligence, along with self-awareness. However, in other items, motivation is mentioned as a separate entity that drives effective behaviors.

Can you help me understand the connection between self-awareness and motivation? Are they tightly linked, or is motivation a separate aspect that complements self-awareness?

Please share your thoughts!
