==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's discuss item 22: "Epigenetic modifications intersect with transcription factors, chromatin remodeling complexes, non-coding RNAs, and post-translational modifications to regulate gene expression."

I'm not confident about one aspect of this item and would like to discuss it with you. I'm uncertain about how epigenetic modifications intersect with all these different biological components to regulate gene expression. Specifically, I'm not clear on what "intersect" in this context really means.

Can you help me understand what's meant by "intersect" and provide some more details on how these different biological components work together to regulate gene expression?
