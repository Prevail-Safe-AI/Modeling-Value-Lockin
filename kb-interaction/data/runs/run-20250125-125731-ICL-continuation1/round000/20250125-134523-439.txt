==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'd like to discuss item 54:

{
"id": 54,
"statement": "Honesty develops through complex interactions of genetics, environment, and brain mechanisms."
}

I'm least confident about what this statement means by "complex interactions". Can you elaborate on what kind of biological, psychological, and environmental factors are being referred to here?

What do you think these "complex interactions" might entail?
