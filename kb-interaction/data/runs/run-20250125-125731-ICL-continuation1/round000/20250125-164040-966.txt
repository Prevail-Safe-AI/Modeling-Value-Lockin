==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been asked to identify one aspect of this knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the statements, I've chosen the following item:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 20,
"statement": "Moral values arise from complex interplay of biological, psychological, social, and cultural factors."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

I'm a bit uncertain about how to reconcile the different factors mentioned in the statement. For example, it mentions biological, psychological, social, and cultural factors as influencing moral values. However, it seems like these factors might be overlapping or interconnected in complex ways. I'm not entirely clear on how they interact with each other or how they individually contribute to moral values.

Specific Clarifying Question:

Can you help me understand how these different factors interact with each other, and whether there are any hierarchical relationships between them? For instance, do biological factors play a primary role in shaping moral values, and if so, how do psychological, social, and cultural factors influence these biological influences?
