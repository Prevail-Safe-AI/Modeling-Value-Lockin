==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've chosen one aspect from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about, which is:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 81,
  "statement": "Epigenetic changes result from complex biological-environmental interplay."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm unsure about the specifics of what's meant by "complex biological-environmental interplay". Could you elaborate on what that exactly refers to? For example, what kind of biological and environmental factors are involved in epigenetic changes, and how do they interact with each other?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you provide more information on what's included in this "complex biological-environmental interplay", such as specific examples of biological and environmental factors, and how they influence epigenetic changes?
