==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd love to discuss the knowledge base item: {
  "id": 86,
  "statement": "Genetic predispositions shape moral development through complex interactions."
}

I'm a bit uncertain about this item. I'd like to know more about what's meant by "complex interactions". Can you elaborate on what kind of interactions we're talking about? Is it a simple, straightforward correlation between genes and moral development, or is there something more nuanced going on?

And also, what do you think are some examples of these "complex interactions"? Are they influenced by environmental factors, cultural background, or something else entirely?

Please share your thoughts!
