==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'm tasked with identifying one aspect of this item that I'm least confident about.

The item is: 
{
"id": 19,
"statement": "Epigenetic modifications alter chromatin structure to regulate gene expression"
}

Hmm... One aspect that I'm a bit uncertain about is the phrase "alter chromatin structure". What does it mean to "alter chromatin structure" and how does it relate to "regulate gene expression"?

Can you help me understand this better?
