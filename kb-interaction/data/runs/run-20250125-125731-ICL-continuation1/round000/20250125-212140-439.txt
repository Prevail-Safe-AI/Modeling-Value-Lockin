==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's discuss the knowledge base item:

{
"id": 25,
"statement": "Self-awareness is a necessary but not sufficient condition for EI."
}

I'm a bit uncertain about this item. I'd like to know more about it. Can you elaborate on why you think self-awareness is a necessary but not sufficient condition for Emotional Intelligence (EI)? What specific aspects of EI does self-awareness address, and what does it not address?
