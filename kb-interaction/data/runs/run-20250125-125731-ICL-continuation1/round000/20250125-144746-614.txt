==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with Item #93: "Epigenetic changes result from complex interplay between biology and environment."

I'm least confident about this aspect. I'm not sure if I fully understand how epigenetic changes occur and how biology and environment interact to produce these changes.

Can you help me clarify some of these concepts? For instance, what do you mean by "complex interplay" between biology and environment? How do these two factors influence epigenetic changes? And what kind of biological processes are involved in epigenetic modification?

Please share your insights!
