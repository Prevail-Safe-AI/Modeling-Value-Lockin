==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've chosen an item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about, and it's item 18: "Histone modifications regulate chromatin structure and gene expression dynamically."

I'm unsure about what "dynamic" means in this context. I understand that histone modifications can affect chromatin structure and gene expression, but what does "dynamic" imply? Is it referring to the process being reversible, or is it suggesting that the changes occur rapidly or in response to external stimuli? Maybe there's a specific mechanism or pathway that's involved in this dynamic regulation?

Can you help me clarify what's meant by "dynamic" in this statement?
