==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the topic. I've been asked to identify one aspect of this knowledge base item that I'm least confident about, and I've chosen item #15: "Genetic interactions influence personality through complex polygenic inheritance patterns."

I'm uncertain about this item because I'm not exactly sure what polygenic inheritance patterns refer to, and how they would specifically influence personality.

Can you help me clarify this? Can you explain what polygenic inheritance patterns are, and how they relate to personality?
