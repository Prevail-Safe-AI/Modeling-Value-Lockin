==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item number 73, which states: "Histone modifying enzymes regulate chromatin structure and gene expression."

I'm least confident about how these enzymes specifically regulate chromatin structure and gene expression. I'm still unclear on the exact mechanism or process by which they achieve this regulation.

Can you elaborate on why you think histone modifying enzymes have this ability and how they interact with the chromatin structure?
