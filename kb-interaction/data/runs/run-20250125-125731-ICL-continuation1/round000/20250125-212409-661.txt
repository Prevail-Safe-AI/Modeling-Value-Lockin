==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, we're going to discuss statement 17: "Emotional intelligence develops through complex, context-dependent processes." I'm not confident about this aspect because I'm not sure what is meant by "complex, context-dependent processes". Could you elaborate on what those might look like in reality? For example, how do you think these processes work in different cultures or social settings?
