==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, I'm looking at this knowledge base, and there's a statement that says: "Chromatin structure regulates gene expression through accessibility and modifications." Specifically, I'm looking at item #4.

I'm feeling a bit uncertain about how chromatin structure regulates gene expression. Can you help me understand it better? What does "accessibility" mean in this context, and how do histone modifications come into play?
