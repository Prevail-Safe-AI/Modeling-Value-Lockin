==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
  "id": 77,
  "statement": "Economic inequality has social and political consequences."
}

I'm not confident about this item. I'm uncertain about how this statement relates to the broader discussion of morality. In other words, I'm not sure why economic inequality has social and political consequences, and what kind of consequences we're talking about.

Can you help me understand this better?

What are some specific ways in which economic inequality leads to social and political consequences? Are there any examples or explanations that could help clarify this statement?
