==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into this knowledge base item:

{
"id": 19,
"statement": "Honesty is foundation of trust, requires consistency and integrity"
}

I'm going to choose this item because I want to understand why honesty is considered the foundation of trust. I'm curious about the relationship between honesty, consistency, and integrity.

Can you elaborate on why honesty is considered the foundation of trust? What do you think the authors mean by "requires consistency and integrity"? Are there any specific examples or contexts where this might be particularly important?
