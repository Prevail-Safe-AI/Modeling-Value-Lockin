==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's take a look at this statement: "Honesty emerges from internalized moral identity, self-awareness, and values." 

I'm not 100% confident about this aspect: "internalized moral identity". I'm not entirely clear on what exactly it means and how it relates to honesty. Can you elaborate on what you mean by "internalized moral identity"?
