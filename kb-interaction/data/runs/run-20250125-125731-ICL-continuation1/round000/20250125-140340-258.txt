==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to know more about the item:

```
{
  "id": 41,
  "statement": "Epigenetic changes result from complex biological and environmental interactions."
}
```

Specifically, I'm unsure about the idea that epigenetic changes result from complex biological and environmental interactions. Can you elaborate on why you think this is the case?

Also, what do you think are some examples of how biological and environmental factors might interact to influence epigenetic changes?
