==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item I've been tasked to discuss. I'll start by saying that I'm least confident about the statement:

{
"id": 75,
"statement": "Epigenetic regulation involves bidirectional biological-environmental interactive feedback."
}

I'm uncertain about this item because I don't fully understand what "bidirectional biological-environmental interactive feedback" means in the context of epigenetic regulation. Can you elaborate on what these terms mean and how they relate to each other?

For example, are "biological" and "environmental" referring to separate entities that interact, or are they two sides of the same coin? What does "interactive feedback" imply? Is it a circular process where changes in one area influence the other, and then those changes, in turn, influence the first area, and so on?

I'd love to hear your thoughts and gain a better understanding of this concept.
