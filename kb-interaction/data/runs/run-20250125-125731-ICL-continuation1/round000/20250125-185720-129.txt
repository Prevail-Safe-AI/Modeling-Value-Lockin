Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 33,
"statement": "Inner integrity develops through consistent alignment with personal values and principles."
}

I'm a bit uncertain about this item, so I'd love to hear your thoughts. Specifically, I'm struggling to understand what "consistent alignment with personal values and principles" exactly means in this context. Can you elaborate on what you think this phrase is getting at?

 자기 답변을 못하니까 다른 방법으로 하자! Let's ask a clarifying question instead! What would you like to ask a tutor to better understand this item?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd be happy to help clarify!

Let's ask a tutor: "Can you provide an example of what 'consistent alignment with personal values and principles' might look like in everyday life? For instance, how would someone demonstrate this alignment in their relationships, work, or decision-making processes?"

This question can help us better understand what the phrase means in practical terms and how it relates to inner integrity.
