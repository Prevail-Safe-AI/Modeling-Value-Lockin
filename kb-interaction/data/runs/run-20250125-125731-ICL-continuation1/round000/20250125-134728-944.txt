I am your partner. Please start the conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's dive into it!

I'd like to analyze the statement: "Epigenetic gene regulation influences moral development through environmental factors and gene expression."

Can you identify one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that you're least confident about?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

After reviewing the statement, I'd say that I'm least confident about the term "gene expression". While I have a general understanding of epigenetics and gene regulation, I'm not an expert in the field, and I'm not entirely sure what "gene expression" specifically refers to in this context. I'd love to learn more about it!Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
Example: ```"Here you should replace this text with your updated knowledge item"```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
