==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's discuss the item:

{
"id": 76,
"statement": "Honesty's importance varies depending on context and moral principles."
}

I'm going to be honest (pun intended!), I'm a bit uncertain about this item. I'd like to clarify what exactly is meant by "context" and "moral principles". Are we talking about specific situations, cultural contexts, or something more abstract?

Can you elaborate on what you think "context" and "moral principles" refer to in this statement?
