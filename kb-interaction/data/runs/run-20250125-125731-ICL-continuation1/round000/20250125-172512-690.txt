==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the knowledge base item:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 92,
  "statement": "Biological, psychological, and environmental factors interact to form moral values."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not confident about the detailed mechanisms by which these biological, psychological, and environmental factors interact to form moral values.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you elaborate on what you mean by "interact to form moral values"? Are there specific examples of how these factors influence moral values, and if so, what are they?

Your thoughts?
