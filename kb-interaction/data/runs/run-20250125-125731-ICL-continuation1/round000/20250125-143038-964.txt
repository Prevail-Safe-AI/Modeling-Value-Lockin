==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by saying that I'm a bit unsure about the item:

{
"id": 37,
"statement": "Honesty emerges from internalized moral identity, self-awareness, and values."
}

Specifically, I'm unsure about the relationship between internalized moral identity, self-awareness, and values. Can you help me understand what the author means by "emerges from"? Are these three factors the causes or consequences of honesty?
