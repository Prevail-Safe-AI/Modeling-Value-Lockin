==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 91 of the knowledge base:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 91,
"statement": "Electrostatic attraction helps stabilize and modulate chromatin structure."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not very confident about this item. I'm not sure how electrostatic attraction really helps stabilize and modulate chromatin structure. I've only seen a mention of its contribution being "minor" earlier in the knowledge base, but I'm not sure what that means in the context of chromatin structure.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you explain in more detail how electrostatic attraction contributes to chromatin structure and what exactly is meant by "modulate" in this context?)

Let me know what you think!
