==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 11,
"statement": "Biological, cultural, psychological interactions shape honesty's complex evolution."
}

I'm least confident about this aspect. I'm unsure about how biological, cultural, and psychological factors interact and contribute to the complex evolution of honesty.

Can you tell me why you think this statement is true? What are some examples of how these factors interact to shape honesty?
