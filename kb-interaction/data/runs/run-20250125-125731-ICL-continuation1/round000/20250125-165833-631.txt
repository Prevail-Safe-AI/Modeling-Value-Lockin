==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by saying that I'm least confident about the relationship between histone modification and chromatin structure alteration in regulating gene expression. I'd like to ask, what is the specific mechanism by which histone modification plays a crucial role in altering chromatin structure and regulating gene expression? Is it just the electrostatic interactions between histones and DNA, or are there other factors at play as well?
