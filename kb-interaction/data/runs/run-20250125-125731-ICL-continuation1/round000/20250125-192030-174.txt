==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the item we're discussing: "Moral development originates from interplay between biological, environmental, and cultural factors."

I'm least confident about this aspect because I'm not entirely sure how these biological, environmental, and cultural factors interact with each other to influence moral development. Are these factors mutually exclusive, or do they overlap in some way?

Can you help me understand this better?
