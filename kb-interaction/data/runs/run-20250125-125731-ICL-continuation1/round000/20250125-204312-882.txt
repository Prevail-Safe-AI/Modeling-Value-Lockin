==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'd like to discuss Item 97: "Effectiveness of honesty can vary depending on context, relationships, and goals."

I'm not confident about this aspect, so I'd like to ask: Can you explain why you think effectiveness of honesty can vary depending on these factors? What specific scenarios or examples come to mind where honesty might be more or less effective?
