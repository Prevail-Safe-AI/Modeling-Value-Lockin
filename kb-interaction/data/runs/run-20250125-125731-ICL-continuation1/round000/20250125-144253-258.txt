==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the statement "Item to Discuss: { "id": 30, "statement": "Epigenetic modifications interact with transcription factors to regulate gene expression." }"

Things I'm Uncertain About This Item:

Honestly, I'm least confident about the idea that epigenetic modifications directly interact with transcription factors to regulate gene expression. I'm wondering if this interaction is specific to certain types of cells, tissues, or organisms, or if it's a general phenomenon.

Specific Clarifying Questions:

* Can you provide more information on the types of epigenetic modifications that are most likely to interact with transcription factors?
* Are there any specific examples of genes or gene expression pathways that have been shown to be regulated by this interaction?
* How do transcription factors and epigenetic modifications interact to regulate gene expression, and what are some of the key mechanisms involved?

Your thoughts?
