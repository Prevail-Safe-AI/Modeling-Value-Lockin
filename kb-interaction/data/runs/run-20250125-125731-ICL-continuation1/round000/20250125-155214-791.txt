==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd love to discuss the item:

{
"id": 82,
"statement": "Histone modifications regulate chromatin accessibility through physical interactions"
}

I'm the least confident about the aspect that histone modifications regulate chromatin accessibility through physical interactions. I'm not entirely sure what "physical interactions" mean in this context, and how histone modifications specifically affect chromatin accessibility.

Can you elaborate on what you think "physical interactions" refers to? For example, are we talking about electrostatic interactions, steric hindrance, or something else entirely?

Also, could you help me understand how histone modifications impact chromatin accessibility? Is it a direct effect, or is there an intermediate step involved?
