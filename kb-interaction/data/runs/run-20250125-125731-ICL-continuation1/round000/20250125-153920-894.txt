==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. Going through the items, I came across item #82: "Moral judgments depend on context, consequences, and personal values." This statement seems quite important, but I'm a bit uncertain about it. I'd like to know more.

Can you elaborate on what you think it means by "personal values"? Are personal values specific to an individual, or can they be influenced by cultural or societal norms? In other words, is it possible for an individual to have values that are contradictory to the values of their cultural group?

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this topic.
