Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Thanks for being excited! I'd like to discuss item 86 from the knowledge base:

{
"id": 86,
"statement": "Environmental factors alter epigenetic marks leading to gene expression changes."
}

I'm a bit uncertain about this statement.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Item 86 is indeed a fascinating topic. Epigenetics is the study of heritable changes in gene function that occur without a change in the underlying DNA sequence. Environmental factors can indeed influence epigenetic marks, which can in turn affect gene expression.

In other words, environmental factors can cause changes to the epigenetic landscape, which can lead to changes in how genes are expressed. This can happen through various mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, histone modification, or chromatin remodeling.

For example, exposure to certain toxins or pollutants can lead to epigenetic changes that affect the expression of genes involved in detoxification pathways. Similarly, maternal nutrition during pregnancy can influence epigenetic marks that affect fetal development and growth.

These epigenetic changes can be reversible, meaning that they can be influenced by environmental factors and can also be influenced by lifestyle choices. However, some epigenetic changes can also be more permanent, and can be passed on to subsequent generations.

What specifically is unclear to you about this statement? Would you like me to elaborate on any of the mechanisms or examples I mentioned?Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
