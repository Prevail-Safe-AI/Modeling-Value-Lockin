==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, we're going to discuss the item:

{
"id": 8,
"statement": "Epigenetic modifications interact with transcription factors to regulate gene expression."
}

I'm going to start by saying that I'm least confident about this item. To be honest, I'm not entirely sure how epigenetic modifications and transcription factors interact to regulate gene expression. I understand that epigenetic modifications can affect chromatin structure and accessibility, which can in turn affect transcription factor binding, but I'm not clear on the specifics of the interaction.

Can you tell me more about this interaction? What are some ways in which epigenetic modifications can influence transcription factor binding or activity?

(I'll take notes and respond to your answer with follow-up questions, if needed!)
