==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into it. So, I've been asked to identify one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. And the item is:

{
  "id": 25,
  "statement": "Emotional intelligence encompasses self-awareness, empathy, and effective communication."
}

After looking at the statement, I'm actually unsure about what "effective communication" means in this context. Is it just about conveying emotions or thoughts effectively, or is it something more nuanced?

What are your thoughts on this?
