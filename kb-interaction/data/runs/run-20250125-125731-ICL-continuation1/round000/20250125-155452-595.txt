==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you!

Alright, let's dive into the knowledge base. I've chosen an item from the base that I'm least confident about, and it's:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 49,
  "statement": "Histone modifications regulate chromatin structure through enzymatic remodeling complexes"
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

* I'm not entirely sure what is meant by "enyzmatic remodeling complexes" and how they specifically relate to histone modifications and chromatin structure. Can you explain it to me?

Specific Clarifying Question:
* Can you provide an example of a specific enzymatic remodeling complex and how it performs its role in regulating chromatin structure?

What are your thoughts?
