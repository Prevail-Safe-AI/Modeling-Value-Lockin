==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's go with the item we're discussing: "Honesty's moral value varies across situations and contexts."

I'm least confident about this item. I'm not sure what it means by "varies across situations and contexts". Is it saying that honesty is not always the best option? Or is it saying that what is considered honest in one situation may not be considered honest in another?

Can you help me understand this better?
