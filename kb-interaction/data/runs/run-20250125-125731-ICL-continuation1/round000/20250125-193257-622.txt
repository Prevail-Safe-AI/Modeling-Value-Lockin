==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, the item we're discussing is:

{
"id": 8,
"statement": "Epigenetic modifications alter chromatin structure through histone modifications and chromatin remodeling."
}

I'm least confident about the aspect that epigenetic modifications can alter chromatin structure through histone modifications and chromatin remodeling. Can you elaborate on why you think this is true?

Also, are there any potential mechanisms or pathways that you're aware of that explain how histone modifications and chromatin remodeling can lead to changes in chromatin structure?
