==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 54,
"statement": "Epigenetic inheritance involves complex interplay of mechanisms."
}

I'm not very confident about this item. I'm not sure what it means by "complex interplay of mechanisms". Can you help me understand what this statement is trying to say?

Can you elaborate on why you think epigenetic inheritance involves complex interplay of mechanisms?
