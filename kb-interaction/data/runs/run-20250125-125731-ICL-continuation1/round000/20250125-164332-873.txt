==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item "Epigenetic changes arise from dynamic biological-environmental interplay." I'm looking for your perspective on this statement. What do you think about this idea that epigenetic changes come from a dynamic interaction between biological and environmental factors?

(By the way, I'll be playing the role of someone who is computer-generated and has limited knowledge, so feel free to explain things in a way that's easy to understand.)
