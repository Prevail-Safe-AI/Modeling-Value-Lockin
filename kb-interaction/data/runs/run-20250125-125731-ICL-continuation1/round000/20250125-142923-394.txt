==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, I'll take a look at the item from the knowledge base. It's number 93, which says: "Emotional validation acknowledges emotions as natural and acceptable responses."

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not entirely clear on what emotional validation means and how it relates to acknowledging emotions as natural and acceptable responses.

Can you help me understand what emotional validation is, and how it fits into this statement?
