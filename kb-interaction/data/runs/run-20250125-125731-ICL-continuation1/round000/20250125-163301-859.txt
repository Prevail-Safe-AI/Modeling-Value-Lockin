==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, I'll start by saying that I'm not extremely confident about item #26, which states: "Epigenetic mechanisms regulate gene expression through DNA methylation, histone modifications, and chromatin remodeling."

I'm a bit uncertain about how these three epigenetic mechanisms collectively regulate gene expression. Can you help me understand how they work together?
