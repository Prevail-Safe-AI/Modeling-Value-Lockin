==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 74,
"statement": "Electrostatic attraction compacts chromatin, influences gene expression."
}

I'm least confident about this aspect of the statement: the role of electrostatic attraction in chromatin compaction and gene expression.

Can you elaborate on why you think electrostatic attraction is important in chromatin structure and gene regulation? What specific evidence or mechanisms do you know about that support this idea?
