==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss Item 36: "Moral development arises from dynamic interplay of biological, psychological, social, and cultural factors."

I'm least confident about this item because I'm not sure how these four factors (biological, psychological, social, and cultural) interact with each other to influence moral development. It seems like a complex and multifaceted process.

Specifically, I'm unsure about how the biological component contributes to moral development. Is it referring to something like genetics, brain structure, or hormone levels? And how does that interact with the psychological component, which seems to include factors like personality, emotional development, and cognitive development?

Do you have any insights or clarifying questions to help me better understand this item?
