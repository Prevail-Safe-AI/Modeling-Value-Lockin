==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, the item I've chosen to discuss is:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 94,
"statement": "Power imbalances emerge from complex social-economic systems and structures."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not sure how to define what constitutes a "complex social-economic system" and what kind of structures this refers to. Are these structures referring to strict hierarchies, institutions, or something else?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you please provide an example of a social-economic system that demonstrates complex power imbalances and how these structures contribute to these imbalances?

What are your thoughts?
