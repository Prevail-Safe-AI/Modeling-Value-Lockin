==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the item from the knowledge base:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 97,
  "statement": "Epigenetic modifications alter histone proteins by adding/removing chemical groups."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not entirely sure how epigenetic modifications exactly alter histone proteins by adding or removing chemical groups. Can you elaborate on that?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you provide more insight into what kind of chemical groups are being added or removed, and how this process actually happens?
