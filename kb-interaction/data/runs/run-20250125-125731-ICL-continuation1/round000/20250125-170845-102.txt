==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been looking at this knowledge base, and one aspect that caught my attention is the statement:

{
"id": 32,
"statement": "Zinc fingers recognize specific DNA sequences regulating gene expression."
}

I'm not very confident about this item. I'm unsure about how zinc fingers specifically recognize DNA sequences, and what kind of role they play in regulating gene expression.

Can you tell me more about zinc fingers and their function in gene regulation? What makes them specifically recognize certain DNA sequences?
