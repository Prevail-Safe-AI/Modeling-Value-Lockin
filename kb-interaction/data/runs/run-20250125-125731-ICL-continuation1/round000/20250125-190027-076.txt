==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 26 from the knowledge base, which states: "Emotional intelligence encompasses self-awareness, empathy, and social skills." I'm least confident about this item. Here's why:

I'm unsure about what exactly is meant by "emotional intelligence" and how it relates to the three components mentioned: self-awareness, empathy, and social skills. I understand that self-awareness is the ability to recognize and understand one's emotions, empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of others, and social skills are the ability to effectively communicate and interact with others. But I'm not clear on how these components fit together to form "emotional intelligence."

Specifically, I have two questions:

1. What is the definition of emotional intelligence? Is it a synonym for emotional intelligence, or are there other definitions?
2. Can you provide more information on how these three components (self-awareness, empathy, and social skills) are intertwined? How do they work together to form emotional intelligence?

Can you help clarify these points for me?
