==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's get started.

I've identified an item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about, which is:

{
"id": 39,
"statement": "Epigenetic marks influence gene expression through chromatin modifications."
}

To be honest, I'm a bit uncertain about how epigenetic marks specifically "influence" gene expression through chromatin modifications. I understand that epigenetic marks can affect chromatin structure, but I'm not entirely clear on the exact mechanism by which this happens.

Can you help clarify this for me? What would you say is the primary way in which epigenetic marks influence gene expression through chromatin modifications?
