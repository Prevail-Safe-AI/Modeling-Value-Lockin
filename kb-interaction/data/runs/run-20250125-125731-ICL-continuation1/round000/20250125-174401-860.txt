==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into Item 67: "Epigenetic changes arise from dynamic interplay between biological and environmental factors."

I'm a bit uncertain about this item because I'm not entirely sure what's meant by "dynamic interplay" and how it specifically relates to epigenetic changes. Can you help me understand this concept better?

In other words, what does it mean by "dynamic interplay" between biological and environmental factors, and how does this lead to epigenetic changes?
