==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to explore one of the knowledge base items that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the list, I've chosen item 35:

{
"id": 35,
"statement": "Histone modifications regulate chromatin structure and gene expression biochemically"
}

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not entirely clear on what "biochemically" means in this context. Can you help me understand what it means to regulate chromatin structure and gene expression biochemically?

Specifically, what does "biochemically" refer to in relation to histone modifications and chromatin structure? Is it the way histone modifications interact with other molecules, like DNA or transcription factors, or is it something else entirely?
