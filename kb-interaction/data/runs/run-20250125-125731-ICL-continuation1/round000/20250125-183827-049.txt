==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the item we're discussing, which is:

{
  "id": 80,
  "statement": "Power imbalances arise from cumulative historical and social inequalities"
}

I'm uncertain about this item because I'm not entirely clear on what the phrase "cumulative historical and social inequalities" means in this context. Can you help me understand what that means and how it contributes to power imbalances?

Additionally, I'm not sure how this statement relates to the broader topic of epigenetics, which is what the knowledge base is about. Can you help me understand how epigenetics, moral development, and power imbalances might be connected?

Please share your thoughts!
