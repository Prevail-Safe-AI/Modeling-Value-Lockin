==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 46,
"statement": "Biological factors influence values through genetic predispositions and hormonal regulation"
}

I'm least confident about this item. I'm uncertain because I'm not sure how biological factors can directly influence values, especially through genetic predispositions and hormonal regulation.

Can you elaborate on why you think biological factors can influence values in this way?
