==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you!

I'd like to discuss item 97, which states: "Empathetic listening and non-judgmental feedback combine for effective communication."

I'm least confident about this item. I'm not sure what exactly makes empathetic listening and non-judgmental feedback effective in communication. Can you help me understand why these two components combine to achieve effective communication?

What do you think about this item?
