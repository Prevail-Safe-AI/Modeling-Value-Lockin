==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'd like to discuss Item 38:

{
"id": 38,
"statement": "Epigenetic modifications alter chromatin structure through histone modifying enzymes."
}

I'm a bit uncertain about this item. Can you explain why you think epigenetic modifications alter chromatin structure through histone modifying enzymes? What's the mechanism behind this process?

In other words, how do histone modifying enzymes contribute to the alteration of chromatin structure, and what are the consequences of this alteration?
