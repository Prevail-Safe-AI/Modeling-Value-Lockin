==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item:

{
"id": 20,
"statement": "Emotional intelligence encompasses self-awareness, empathy, and social skills."
}

I'm least confident about... the idea that emotional intelligence only encompasses self-awareness, empathy, and social skills. It seems like other statements in the knowledge base suggest that emotional intelligence also involves effective communication, resilience, and others. Am I misreading it?

What do you think?
