==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss one of the items in the knowledge base. Specifically, Item 59:

{
"id": 59,
"statement": "Epigenetic modifications influence chromatin structure through chromatin remodeling and histone modification spreading."
}

I'm least confident about this item. I'm unsure how epigenetic modifications exactly influence chromatin structure through chromatin remodeling and histone modification spreading.

Can you help me understand this better?
