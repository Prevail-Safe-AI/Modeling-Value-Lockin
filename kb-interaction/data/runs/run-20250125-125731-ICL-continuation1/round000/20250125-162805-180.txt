==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into this item from the knowledge base:

Item to Discuss:
{
  "id": 72,
  "statement": "Transcription factors recognize DNA sequences through domain-specific binding modes."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not entirely confident about the notion of "domain-specific binding modes" in relation to transcription factors recognizing DNA sequences. Can you help me understand what that means and how it works?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you elaborate on what domain-specific binding modes refer to in this context, and how transcription factors use this mechanism to recognize specific DNA sequences?
