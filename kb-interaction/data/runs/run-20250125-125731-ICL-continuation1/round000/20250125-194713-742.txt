==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 63,
"statement": "Chromatin structure regulates gene expression through precise DNA-protein interactions."
}

I'm least confident about this aspect: "precise DNA-protein interactions".

Can you elaborate on what you're not sure about? Is it the concept of DNA-protein interactions, or the idea of precise interactions being a key factor in gene regulation?

Also, what would you like to ask a tutor to clarify your understanding of this concept?
