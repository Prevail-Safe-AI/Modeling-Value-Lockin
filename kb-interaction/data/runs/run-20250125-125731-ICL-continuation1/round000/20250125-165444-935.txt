==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 60,
  "statement": "Environmental toxins cause DNA damage, leading to mutations."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not entirely confident about the statement that "Environmental toxins cause DNA damage, leading to mutations." Is this a direct cause-and-effect relationship, or are there potential intermediary steps or factors that influence the outcome? For example, are there specific types of DNA damage that are more likely to occur due to environmental toxins, and how do these DNA lesions ultimately lead to mutations?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain the exact mechanisms by which environmental toxins cause DNA damage, leading to mutations? Are there any specific types of environmental toxins or exposures that are more likely to cause these types of mutations?
