==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by saying that I'm actually least confident about the aspect of epigenetic changes persisting through DNA methylation, histone modifications, and cellular memory mechanisms (item 60). What would you say is the main mechanism behind epigenetic persistence, and are you confident in your understanding of how these mechanisms interact with each other?
