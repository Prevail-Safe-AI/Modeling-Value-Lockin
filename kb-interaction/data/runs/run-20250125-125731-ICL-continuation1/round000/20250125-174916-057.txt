==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 11: "Honesty's importance fluctuates according to situation, emotion, and context". To be honest, I'm not entirely confident about this statement.

Things I'm Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not sure how to define "importance" in this context. What do you think it means?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you elaborate on what you mean by "importance"? Is it referring to the moral value of honesty or its practical value in a given situation?
