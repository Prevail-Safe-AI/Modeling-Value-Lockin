==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 20: "Epigenetic changes influenced by environment shape gene expression and morality."

I'm least confident about this aspect: "Epigenetic changes influenced by environment shape gene expression and morality."

I'm unsure about how epigenetic changes can be influenced by the environment to shape gene expression and morality. Can you help me understand this concept better?

My uncertainty stems from the fact that I don't have a clear understanding of how environmental factors can directly impact gene expression and morality at an epigenetic level. I'd like to know more about the mechanisms by which this occurs.

Will you help me clarify this concept?
