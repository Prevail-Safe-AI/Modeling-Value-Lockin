==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by discussing the item:

{
"id": 98,
"statement": "Structural inequalities result from elite manipulation of influence systems."
}

I'm least confident about this item. I'm uncertain about the phrase "elite manipulation of influence systems". Can you elaborate on what you mean by "elite manipulation" and "influence systems"? What specific aspects of society or systems are you referring to?

Please share your thoughts on this item, and I'll ask follow-up questions to clarify my understanding!
