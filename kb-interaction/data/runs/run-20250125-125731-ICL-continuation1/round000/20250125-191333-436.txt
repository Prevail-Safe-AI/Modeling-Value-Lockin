==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 89: "Epigenetic modifications control gene expression through chromatin structure."

I'm least confident about this item because I'm not entirely sure how epigenetic modifications exactly control gene expression through chromatin structure. Can you elaborate on what's meant by "chromatin structure" in this context?
