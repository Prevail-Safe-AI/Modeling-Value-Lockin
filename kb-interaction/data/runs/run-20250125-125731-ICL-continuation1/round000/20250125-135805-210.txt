==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been asked to identify one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. The item is:

```
{
  "id": 27,
  "statement": "Honesty emerges from complex interplay of genetic, cultural, and psychological factors."
}
```

I'd like to share that I'm uncertain about the aspect of "interplay" between these three factors. I understand that each factor is important for honesty, but I'm not entirely sure how these factors interact and influence each other.

Can you help me better understand how these factors interact? For example, how does the influence of genetics on honesty intersect with cultural values and psychological factors?

Please feel free to clarify and provide any insights.
