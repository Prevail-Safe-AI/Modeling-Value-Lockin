==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the first item:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 69,
  "statement": "Internalized moral identity arises from self-awareness and integrated values."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I am least confident about how internalized moral identity relates to self-awareness and integrated values.

I'm not sure what exactly is meant by "self-awareness" in this context. Is it just being aware of one's own thoughts and feelings, or is it something more specific like being aware of one's own moral principles?

Specific Clarifying Question:
What does "self-awareness" mean in the context of internalized moral identity, and how does it contribute to the development of integrated values?
