==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's talk about the item from the knowledge base:

{
"id": 96,
"statement": "Honesty builds trust through interconnected consistency and transparency."
}

I'm not sure about why honesty is considered to build trust. Can you help me clarify what you mean by "interconnected consistency and transparency"? What does it mean for these concepts to be connected, and how does it contribute to building trust?
