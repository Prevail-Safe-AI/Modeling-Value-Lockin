==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item: "Intentional self-reflection is a structured thought analysis process." (item 94)

I'm actually least confident about the aspect that this intentional self-reflection is indeed a "structured thought analysis process". Can you elaborate on what you think this phrase means? For example, what does "structured" imply in this context? Is it a formal, step-by-step process, or is "structured" more related to the way the thoughts are organized or coherent?
