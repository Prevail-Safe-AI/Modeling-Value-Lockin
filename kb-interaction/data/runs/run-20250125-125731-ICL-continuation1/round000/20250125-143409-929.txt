==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
  "id": 54,
  "statement": "Epigenetic changes can persist across cell divisions through inheritance mechanisms."
}

I'm not entirely confident about this aspect. Specifically, I'm unsure about how epigenetic changes can persist across cell divisions through inheritance mechanisms. Can you help me understand what inheritance mechanisms are being referred to here? Are they biological, environmental, or something else entirely?

What are your thoughts on this?
