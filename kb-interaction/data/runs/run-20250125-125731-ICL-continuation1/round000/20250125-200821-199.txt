==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item:

{
"id": 85,
"statement": "Chromatin looping is a distal chromosomal region interaction mechanism."
}

I'm least confident about this item. I find it a bit unclear what exactly chromatin looping is and how it relates to chromosomal region interactions.

Can you elaborate on what you understand about chromatin looping and how it fits into the context of chromosomal regions interacting?

(e.g. what is chromatin looping, how does it occur, what is its significance in chromosomal region interactions, etc.)
