==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been asked to identify one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the item:

{
"id": 63,
"statement": "Honesty's definition adjusts to context and personal values."
}

I'm a bit uncertain about the phrase "adjusts to context and personal values." What does it mean for honesty's definition to adjust to these factors?

Can you help me clarify this?
