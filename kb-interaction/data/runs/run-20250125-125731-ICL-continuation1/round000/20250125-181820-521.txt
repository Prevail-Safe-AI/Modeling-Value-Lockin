==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I've been asked to identify one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the statements, I've identified:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 35,
"statement": "Epigenetic marks influence gene expression through environmental factors."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm uncertain about how epigenetic marks influence gene expression. I'd like to know more about the specific mechanisms by which environmental factors affect epigenetic marks and, in turn, gene expression.

Specific Clarifying Questions:
1. Can you provide more information on how environmental factors, such as diet, stress, or exposure to chemicals, can lead to changes in epigenetic marks? Are there specific epigenetic marks (e.g., methylation, acetylation) that are more susceptible to environmental influences?
2. How do changes in epigenetic marks affect gene expression? Is it a direct or indirect effect, and what are the key players involved (e.g., epigenetic modifiers, transcription factors, chromatin remodeling complexes)?

What are your thoughts on this item, and would you like to add or clarify anything?
