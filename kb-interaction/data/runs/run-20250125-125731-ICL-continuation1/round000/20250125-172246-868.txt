==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 22 from the knowledge base:

"{ "id": 22, "statement": "Honesty is foundation of trust, requires consistency and integrity" }"

I'm feeling a bit uncertain about this item. I'm wondering if the connection between honesty, consistency, and integrity is a universally accepted concept, or if it's specific to certain contexts or cultures.

Can you elaborate on what you think about this statement?
