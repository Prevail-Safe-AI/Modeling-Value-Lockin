==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by saying that I'm not entirely confident about the statement: "Biological factors indirectly influence personal values through gene expression." Can you tell me more about what you think that statement means?

For instance, how do biological factors influence personal values, and what role does gene expression play in that process?
