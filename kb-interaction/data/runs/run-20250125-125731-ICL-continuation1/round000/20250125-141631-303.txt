==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's talk about the item from the knowledge base:

{
"id": 61,
"statement": "DNA methylation is a targeted and long-lasting epigenetic modification."
}

I'm least confident about this item. I'd say my uncertainty stems from the complexity of epigenetic modifications, particularly DNA methylation. While I understand the general concept, I'm not entirely sure how targeted and long-lasting it is in real-world scenarios.

Can you elaborate on why you think DNA methylation is both targeted and long-lasting? What specific contexts or examples come to mind that illustrate these characteristics?
