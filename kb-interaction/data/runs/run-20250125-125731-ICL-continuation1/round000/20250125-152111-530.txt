==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the knowledge base. Specifically, I'd like to discuss the item:

{
  "id": 78,
  "statement": "Histone modifications alter chromatin structure, accessibility, and gene expression."
}

I'm least confident about this aspect: How exactly do histone modifications alter chromatin structure, accessibility, and gene expression?

I'm uncertain because I'm not entirely clear on the direct causal link between histone modifications and these different aspects of chromatin biology. In other words, how do histone modifications affect chromatin structure, accessibility, and gene expression, and what are the underlying mechanisms? 

What do you think? What are your thoughts on this?
