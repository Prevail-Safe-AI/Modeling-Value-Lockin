==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 59 in the knowledge base. The statement is: "Epigenetic modifications alter chromatin structure by modifying histones."

I'm unsure about this item because it seems to be a direct cause-and-effect relationship between epigenetic modifications and histone modifications. However, I'm not confident about whether this is a correct or oversimplified explanation.

Can you elaborate on why you think epigenetic modifications alter chromatin structure by modifying histones? Is this a widely accepted explanation in the field?

Also, do you think this explanation is specific to a particular context or class of epigenetic modifications?
