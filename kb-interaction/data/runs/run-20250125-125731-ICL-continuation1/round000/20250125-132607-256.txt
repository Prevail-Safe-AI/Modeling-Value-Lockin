==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the item: "{ "id": 60, "statement": "Honesty development arises from genetics, environment, and brain interactions." }". I'd like to identify one aspect of this item that I'm least confident about.

After reading the statement, I'm unsure about the role of genetics in honesty development. I'm wondering if genetics play a significant role in determining an individual's honesty, or if it's more influenced by environmental and brain interactions.

Can you help me clarify this aspect? What's your take on this?
