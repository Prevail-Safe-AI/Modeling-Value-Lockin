==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by discussing Item 16: "Epigenetic marks influence gene expression without changing DNA sequence." I'm not super confident about this aspect. 

Could you help me clarify why it's not changing the DNA sequence? Are the epigenetic marks influencing the accessibility of the DNA sequence to transcription factors, or is it something more complex?
