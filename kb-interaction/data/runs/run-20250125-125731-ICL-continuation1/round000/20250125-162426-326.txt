==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'm going to choose an item that I'm least confident about. I've selected item #38:

{
"id": 38,
"statement": "Epigenetic mechanisms regulate gene expression through DNA methylation, histone modifications."
}

I'm uncertain about this item because I'm not entirely clear on how epigenetic mechanisms, DNA methylation, and histone modifications interact to regulate gene expression. Can you help me understand this better?

What do you think these mechanisms do, and how do they work together to control gene expression?
