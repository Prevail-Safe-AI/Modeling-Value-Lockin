==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into task 1: "Identify one aspect of this item from knowledge base you’re least confident about."

For item 29, I'm going to take a closer look:

"{ 'id': 29, 'statement': 'Emotional intelligence involves self-awareness, empathy, motivation, and flexible behavior.' }"

After reviewing the statement, I'm least confident about the aspect of "flexible behavior". I'm not sure what flexible behavior exactly means in the context of emotional intelligence or how it relates to the other components mentioned (self-awareness, empathy, motivation).

Uncertainty A: What does "flexible behavior" specifically entail? How does it contribute to emotional intelligence?

Can I ask you to elaborate on what you think flexible behavior entails or how it fits into the overall framework of emotional intelligence?
