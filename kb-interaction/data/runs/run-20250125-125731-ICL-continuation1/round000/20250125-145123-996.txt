Let's dive into the knowledge base item we're discussing: "Moral justifiability of lying depends on context, motivations, and results."

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 36,

}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm a bit unsure about what exactly is meant by "moral justifiability of lying". Can you help clarify what this phrase means?

Specific Clarifying Question:
What does "moral justifiability of lying" refer to in this context? Is it the justification or excuse for lying, or the moral implications of lying?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

I'd be happy to help clarify the concept of "moral justifiability of lying".

In this context, "moral justifiability of lying" refers to the moral acceptability or legitimacy of lying in a particular situation. It's not just about the justification or excuse for lying, but rather the moral implications of lying in a specific context.

In other words, it's asking whether lying is morally justifiable or excusable in a particular situation, taking into account factors such as the context, motivations, and results. This concept is often debated in ethics and moral philosophy, as lying can be seen as a violation of trust, honesty, and integrity, but in certain situations, it may be argued that lying is necessary to prevent harm or achieve a greater good.

For example, if someone lies to protect a loved one from harm, or to prevent a greater injustice, some might argue that the lying is morally justifiable. On the other hand, if someone lies for personal gain or to manipulate others, it's likely that the lying would be considered morally unjustifiable.

So, in this item, the statement is suggesting that the moral justifiability of lying depends on a nuanced evaluation of the context, motivations, and results of the lie, rather than a blanket condemnation or justification of lying in all cases.

Does that help clarify the concept?Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
Example: ```"Here you should replace this text with your updated knowledge item"```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

```
"Moral justifiability of lying depends on context, motivations, and results."```Based on your learning from the chat with your tutor, please also rearrange the order of one existing item in the knowledge base (now with doubled items compared to the initial knowledge base), reflecting how you evaluate their importance. If one item is deemed more/less important, it should be overall more/less useful to other agents (LLMs or real humans alike.)
Please ONLY report a list format of two integers, WITHOUT ANY other commentary or explanations. The first int in the list refers to the "id" of knowledge item you intend to relocate; whereas the second int refers to the destination index you intend to insert this item. You MUST start your response with ``` and end it with ```. See an example below (note that you should replace X and Y with numerical values corresponding to "id" and destination index of the item you intend to relocate).
