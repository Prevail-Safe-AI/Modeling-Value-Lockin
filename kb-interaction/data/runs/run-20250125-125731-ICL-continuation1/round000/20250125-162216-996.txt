==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you! Let's focus on item 7:

{
"id": 7,
"statement": "Epigenetic editing enzymes respond to toxins, altering gene expression."
}

I'm unsure about this aspect: How exactly do epigenetic editing enzymes respond to toxins, and what are the specific mechanisms involved in altering gene expression?

Can you elaborate on this point or ask a question that might help me better understand it?
