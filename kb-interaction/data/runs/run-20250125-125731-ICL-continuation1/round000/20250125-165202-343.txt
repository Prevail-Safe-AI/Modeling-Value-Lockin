==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 92, which states: "Epigenetic changes arise from dynamic biological-environmental interactions". I'm surprised to find it quite straightforward, yet I'm still a bit uncertain about it.

Things I'm Uncertain About This Item:

* I'm not entirely sure what is meant by "dynamic biological-environmental interactions". Can you elaborate on what this phrase is referring to?

Specific Clarifying Question: What specific mechanisms or processes within biological and environmental systems are responsible for generating these dynamic interactions that lead to epigenetic changes? Are there any key players or pathways involved in this process that I should be aware of?

Please share your insights or help me clarify this concept!
