==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you! I'll start by saying that I've been given a knowledge base and asked to discuss one aspect of it that I'm least confident about. The item I've chosen is:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 85,
"statement": "Honesty development involves complex interactions between genetic, cultural, and psychological factors."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not entirely sure how these three factors - genetic, cultural, and psychological - interact and influence honesty development. For example, how do genetic factors, such as personality traits, impact honesty? And how do cultural and psychological factors, such as upbringing and social norms, also come into play?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand the specific ways in which these factors interact and influence honesty development? For instance, are there any notable studies or research that demonstrate the role of each factor in shaping honesty?
