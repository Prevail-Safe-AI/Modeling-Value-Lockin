==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item we're discussing: {
  "id": 33,
  "statement": "Epigenetic modifications can dynamically regulate chromatin structure and gene expression."
}

I'm least confident about this item because I'm unsure about the extent to which epigenetic modifications can truly "dynamically regulate" chromatin structure and gene expression. I'm wondering if there are any limitations or constraints to this ability, or if it's a more general statement that applies to certain specific contexts or situations.

Can you help clarify my understanding?

What do you think about this item? Are you confident or uncertain about it too?
