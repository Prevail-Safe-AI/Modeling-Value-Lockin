==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'd like to discuss the item with id 4:

{
"id": 4,
"statement": "Histone modifications regulate chromatin structure, gene expression dynamics."
}

I'm not entirely confident about this aspect. Could you elaborate on why histone modifications regulate chromatin structure and gene expression dynamics? What kind of biological processes are involved, and how do these modifications affect gene expression?

What are your thoughts on this?
