==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, let's discuss item 74:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 74,
"statement": "Biological factors influence moral judgments through brain structure and processing."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm unsure about the specific biological mechanisms that influence moral judgments. For example, what exactly does "brain structure" refer to in this context? Is it related to neurotransmitters, neural pathways, or something else?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain how brain structure and processing contribute to moral judgments, and provide some examples of specific biological factors that influence moral decision-making?
