==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the item: "Genetic predispositions influence moral development through complex interactions." (Item 53)

I'm a bit uncertain about the statement, and I'd like to clarify it. I'm not exactly sure what "complex interactions" means in this context. How would you define these interactions, exactly?

Also, do we mean to say that genetic predispositions have a direct influence on moral development, or is it more of a indirect influence, where genetics shape certain personality traits or behaviors that then affect moral development?

Can you help me understand this item better?
