==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item about epigenetic editing enzymes modifying DNA methylation using S-adenosylmethionine. I'd like to identify one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about and explore it further.

The item that stands out to me is:

```
{
  "id": 79,
  "statement": "Epigenetic editing enzymes modify DNA methylation using S-adenosylmethionine."
}
```

I'm uncertain about the specific way S-adenosylmethionine is used in the process of modifying DNA methylation by epigenetic editing enzymes. Can you help me understand why this item is stated this way?
