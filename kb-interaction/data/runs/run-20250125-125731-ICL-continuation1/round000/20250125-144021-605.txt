==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, I've been looking at this knowledge base and I'm a bit uncertain about one of the statements. It's item #68:

"Histone modification types influence chromatin structure and gene expression."

I'm not sure why I'm uncertain about it, but I feel like I'd like to know more about the relationship between histone modification types and chromatin structure, and how that influences gene expression.

Can you help me out and elaborate on why I should be confident about this statement? Or maybe you could help me understand it better?
