==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item. I've selected one aspect of it that I'm least confident about, which is:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 61,
  "statement": "Histone modifications regulate chromatin structure through chemical changes."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm uncertain about the connection between histone modifications and chemical changes. I'd like to understand more about how these chemical changes impact chromatin structure and gene expression. It's a complex topic, and I'd appreciate some clarification.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you explain how histone modifications lead to chemical changes in chromatin structure, and how these changes ultimately affect gene expression? Are there any specific molecular mechanisms or processes that I should be aware of?

Your turn!
