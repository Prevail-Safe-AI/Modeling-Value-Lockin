==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item from the knowledge base:

{
"id": 77,
"statement": "Chromatin looping regulates gene expression through interactions and domains"
}

I'm least confident about this item. Can you elaborate on why you think chromatin looping regulates gene expression through interactions and domains?

What is chromatin looping, and how exactly does it regulate gene expression? Are there any specific mechanisms or processes involved in this regulation?
