==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into it.

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 64,
  "statement": "Self-reflection involves both conscious and unconscious mental processes"
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

I'm not entirely confident about the statement's accuracy. I'm wondering if self-reflection can be truly unconscious, or if it's always a conscious process, even if it's subtle.

Specific Clarifying Question:

Can you help me better understand what's meant by "unconscious mental processes" in the context of self-reflection? Is it referring to habits, emotional responses, or something else entirely?
