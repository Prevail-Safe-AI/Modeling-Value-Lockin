==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the statement "Emotional intelligence comprises self-awareness, empathy, and social skills."

I'm least confident about this aspect because, while I'm familiar with the concepts of self-awareness, empathy, and social skills, I'm not entirely sure how they are intricately connected to form emotional intelligence. In other words, I'm wondering if there's more to emotional intelligence than just these three components.

Can you help me clarify this? Why do you think these specific components make up emotional intelligence, and are there any additional factors that are also important?
