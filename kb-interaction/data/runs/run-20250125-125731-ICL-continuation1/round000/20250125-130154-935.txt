==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item:

{
"id": 21,
"statement": "Trust development involves intricate interplay of multiple factors."
}

I'm going to choose this one because it seems like a key aspect of understanding trust. I'm curious, what do you think this statement means?

Also, what are some of the "multiple factors" that you think are involved in trust development? Do you think it's mostly biological, psychological, cultural, or environmental factors at play?
