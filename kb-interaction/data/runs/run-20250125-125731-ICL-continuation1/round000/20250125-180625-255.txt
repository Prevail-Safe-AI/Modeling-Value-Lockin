==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to know more about one aspect of the item from the knowledge base. It's item number 10, which says: " Histones' positive charge attracts DNA's negative charge, forming nucleosomes."

I'm least confident about this item. I'm not sure why histones' positive charge attracts DNA's negative charge or how this attraction leads to the formation of nucleosomes.

Can you help me understand this better?
