==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's talk about the item from the knowledge base that I've chosen, which is:

{
  "id": 66,
  "statement": "Transcription factors recognize DNA sequences through 3D structure complementarity."
}

I'm least confident about this item because I don't fully understand what "3D structure complementarity" means in this context. Can you help me clarify what this phrase is referring to?

What do you think this statement is trying to say? How do transcription factors recognize DNA sequences, and what does this concept of "3D structure complementarity" have to do with it?
