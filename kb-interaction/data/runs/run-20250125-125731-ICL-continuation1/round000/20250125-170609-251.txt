==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss Item 87: "S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is a methyl donor in DNA methylation."

I'm not entirely confident about this aspect of the knowledge base. I'm unsure about what SAM exactly does in the process of DNA methylation, and how it fits into the bigger picture of epigenetic regulation.

Can you tell me more about SAM's role in DNA methylation? For example, how does it donate methyl groups to DNA, and what are the consequences of this process for gene regulation?

And maybe you can also elaborate on why SAM is specifically mentioned in this context, as opposed to other molecules that might also play a role in DNA methylation?
