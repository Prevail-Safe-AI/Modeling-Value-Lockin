Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 22,
  "statement": "Honesty is just one aspect of trust, influenced by multiple factors."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not entirely sure what is meant by "multiple factors" in this statement. Are they referring to internal factors within the individual, external factors in their environment, or a mix of both?

Can you elaborate on this?
