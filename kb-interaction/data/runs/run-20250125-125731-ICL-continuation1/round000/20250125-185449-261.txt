==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the item I'm least confident about, which is:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 25,
  "statement": "Chromatin interactions dynamically regulate gene expression through looping and remodeling."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
*yet to be specified*

Specific Clarifying Question:
*Not yet formulated*

So, my first question is: Can you elaborate on what you think "looping" and "remodeling" exactly refer to in the context of chromatin interactions and gene expression?
