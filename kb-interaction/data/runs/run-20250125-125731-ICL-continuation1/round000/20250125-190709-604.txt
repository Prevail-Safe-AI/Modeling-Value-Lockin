==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item we're least confident about. After reviewing the knowledge base, I think the item `{
  "id": 98,
  "statement": "DNA-protein interactions: proteins bind to specific DNA sequences for gene regulation."
}` seems to be a fundamental concept in biology, but I'm not entirely confident about it.

Can you elaborate on why you're uncertain about this aspect? Is it because you're not familiar with the specific mechanisms of DNA-protein interactions or because you're not convinced about the importance of this process in gene regulation?
