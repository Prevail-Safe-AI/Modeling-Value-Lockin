==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Item 71 stands out to me - "Histones undergo various modifications, including phosphorylation and ubiquitination." I'm least confident about this aspect because I'm not entirely sure what these modifications mean in the context of chromatin structure and gene regulation.

Can you help me understand what phosphorylation and ubiquitination are in the context of histones? For example, how do these modifications affect chromatin structure, and what is the impact on gene expression?
