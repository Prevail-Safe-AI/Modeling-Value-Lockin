==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's get started. I've been assigned to discuss this item from the knowledge base:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 75,
"statement": "Emotional intelligence combines self-awareness, empathy, and social competence dynamically."
}

Things I'm Uncertain About This Item:

* I'm least confident about how this statement defines emotional intelligence. I'm not sure what it means by "combines dynamically". Is it saying that emotional intelligence is a continuous process where self-awareness, empathy, and social competence are constantly interacting with each other? Or is it suggesting that emotional intelligence is a combination of these three components in a specific proportion?

Specific Clarifying Questions:

* Can you please elaborate on what "combines dynamically" means in this context? Is there a specific theory or framework that supports this concept?
* How do these three components (self-awareness, empathy, and social competence) interact with each other in an individual's emotional intelligence? Are there specific situations or scenarios where one component takes precedence over the others?

What are your thoughts on this item? Can you help me clarify my understanding?
