==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into item 91. I'm going to share that an aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about is:

Item: {
"id": 91,
"statement": "Electrostatic attraction, while present, plays a secondary role."
}

Uncertainty: I'm uncertain about the claim that electrostatic attraction "plays a secondary role" in gene regulation. I'm not sure what exactly is being referred to by "secondary role" or how it impacts our understanding of electrostatic attraction.

Would you like to elaborate on the context of this statement or provide more information about what is meant by "secondary role"?
