==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I want to discuss the item with ID 90:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 90,
  "statement": "Honesty develops through complex interplay of genetics, brain, and social factors"
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
Honestly, I'm least confident about the statement suggesting that honesty develops through a complex interplay of genetics, brain, and social factors.

Elaborate why you’re uncertain about that aspect:
Can you help me understand what you mean by "complex interplay"? How do you think genetics, brain, and social factors interact with each other to shape honesty?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you provide an example of how these factors might interact to influence honesty? For instance, how might genetics or brain development affect a person's ability to make honest decisions, and how might social factors, like family or cultural upbringing, influence that development?
