==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item "Internalized moral identity shapes one's character and integrity." (id: 56)

I'm most uncertain about the phrase "shapes one's character and integrity". Can you help me understand what this means? For example, what does it imply about how internalized moral identity influences a person's behavior, decision-making, or personality?
