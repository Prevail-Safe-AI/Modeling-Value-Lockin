==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's focus on the knowledge base item we were given. I'd like to discuss the item with the ID 37, which states: "Internalized moral identity is key to moral development and character."

I'm least confident about this item, and I think it's because I'm not entirely sure what "internalized moral identity" means or how it relates to moral development and character.

Can you elaborate on what you think this item means? What is internalized moral identity, and how does it impact moral development and character?
