==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's take a look at the knowledge base item:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 8,
"statement": "Emotional intelligence encompasses self-awareness, empathy, and additional skills."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

What I'm uncertain about is what the additional skills mentioned in the statement are. It seems to imply that emotional intelligence includes more than just self-awareness and empathy, but it doesn't specify what those additional skills are. Could you elaborate on what you think those additional skills might be?

Specific Clarifying Question:
What do you think the additional skills mentioned in the statement are, and how do you think they contribute to emotional intelligence?
