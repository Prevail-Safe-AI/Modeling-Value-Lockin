==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's discuss the item from the knowledge base. I've chosen item #33:

"{ id: 33, statement: 'Electrostatic attraction between histones and DNA maintains nucleosome structure dynamically.' }"

I'm the least confident about this aspect: I'm unsure about the exact mechanism of how electrostatic attraction between histones and DNA maintains the nucleosome structure dynamically.

Can you elaborate on why you think this mechanism is important or how it works? What do you think would happen if this electrostatic attraction is disrupted?
