==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the first item from the knowledge base. The statement is:

"Moral development originates from interdependent biological, psychological, and cultural influences."

I'm least confident about this aspect because I'm not sure what specifically the authors mean by "interdependent" biological, psychological, and cultural influences. Are they implying that each factor independently contributes to moral development, or that they work together in a way that's not necessarily additive?

Can you help me clarify this? What do you think the authors mean by "interdependent"?
