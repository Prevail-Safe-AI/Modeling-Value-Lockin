==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I think I'll start by saying that I'm not entirely confident about the aspect of epigenetic modifications recruiting histone-modifying enzymes to regulate chromatin structure.

Could you elaborate on what you think this means? How do epigenetic modifications specifically "recruit" histone-modifying enzymes, and what is the aim of regulating chromatin structure?

What's your understanding of this process?
