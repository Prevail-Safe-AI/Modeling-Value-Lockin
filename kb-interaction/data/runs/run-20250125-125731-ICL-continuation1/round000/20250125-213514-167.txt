==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by saying that I'm least confident about the item:

{
"id": 23,
"statement": "Epigenetic modifications regulate gene expression through complex mechanisms."
}

I'm uncertain about this item because I struggle to understand what's meant by "complex mechanisms". Can you elaborate on what these mechanisms are? For example, are we talking about specific protein interactions, epigenetic mark Reader-Writers, or something else entirely?

Additionally, I'm not entirely sure how epigenetic modifications regulate gene expression. Is it a direct process or does it involve intermediate steps? Are there specific epigenetic marks that are more important for regulating gene expression than others?

What's your take on this item?
