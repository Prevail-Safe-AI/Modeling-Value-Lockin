==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"-id": 78,
"statement": "Internalized moral identity develops from complex socialization and self-reflection interactions."
}

I'm least confident about this item. I'm unsure how internalized moral identity develops exactly. I mean, we have socialization and self-reflection, which seem like key factors, but I'm not entirely clear on how these two processes work together to shape our moral identity.

Can you elaborate on why you think internalized moral identity develops through complex socialization and self-reflection interactions? Are there specific stages or milestones involved? How do these interactions shape our moral values and standards?

What do you think?
