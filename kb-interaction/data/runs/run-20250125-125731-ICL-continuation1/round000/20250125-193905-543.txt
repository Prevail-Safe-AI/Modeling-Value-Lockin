==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you!

Let's dive into the conversation. I'd like to discuss the statement "Histone modifications influence chromatin structure through dynamic interactions." I'm least confident about this aspect: how exactly do histone modifications influence chromatin structure through dynamic interactions?

Can you help me understand what is meant by "dynamic interactions" in this context?
