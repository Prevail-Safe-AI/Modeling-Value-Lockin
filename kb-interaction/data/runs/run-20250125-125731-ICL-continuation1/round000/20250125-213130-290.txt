==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item:

{
"id": 82,
"statement": "Histone modifications regulate chromatin structure through chemical changes."
}

I'd like to know more about the relationship between histone modifications and chromatin structure. Specifically, what are these "chemical changes" referred to in the statement?

Can you help clarify what's meant by "chemical changes" in this context?
