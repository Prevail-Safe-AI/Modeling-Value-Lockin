Let's dive into the item from the knowledge base:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 35,
  "statement": "Electrostatic attraction compacts chromatin, influencing gene expression and accessibility."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

I'm least confident about the statement's claim that electrostatic attraction compacts chromatin. I'm wondering what specific mechanisms are involved in this process and how it influences gene expression and accessibility.

Specific Clarifying Question:

Could you please elaborate on how electrostatic attraction exactly compacts chromatin and what role it plays in gene expression and accessibility? Are there any specific experiments or studies that have demonstrated this?

Please share your thoughts, and let's discuss!
