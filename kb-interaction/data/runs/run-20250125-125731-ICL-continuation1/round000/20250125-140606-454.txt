==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by discussing Item 7:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 7,
"statement": "Moral principles are nuanced, context-dependent, and adaptable."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm unsure about what exactly is meant by "nuanced". What do you think this word is conveying in this context?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what is meant by "nuanced" in this statement, and how it relates to the context-dependent and adaptable nature of moral principles?
