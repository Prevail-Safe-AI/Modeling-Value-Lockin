==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the knowledge base item:

{
"id": 52,
"statement": "Non-coding RNAs recruit histone-modifying enzymes to regulate chromatin structure."
}

I'm least confident about this item. Can you help me understand why non-coding RNAs would recruit histone-modifying enzymes to regulate chromatin structure? What is the mechanism behind this process?
