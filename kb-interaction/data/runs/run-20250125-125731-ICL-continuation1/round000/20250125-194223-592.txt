==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start. For item 37, I'm interested in understanding it better. The statement "Emotional intelligence involves complex understanding of human emotions unconsciously" raises some questions for me.

I'd like to know more about what you mean by "complex understanding of human emotions". Can you elaborate on what that implies? How would you define "complex" in this context?

Also, what do you mean by "unconsciously"? Do you think emotional intelligence is automatic and outside of our conscious awareness, or is it more about being aware of our emotional processes but not necessarily rationalizing them?

These are my uncertainties about the item. What's your take on it?
