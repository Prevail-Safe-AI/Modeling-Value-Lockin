==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I've selected an item that caught my attention:

```
{
  "id": 97,
  "statement": "Emotional intelligence is integration of self-awareness, empathy, and social skills"
}
```

I'm unsure about this item, and I'd like to clarify some aspects. Specifically, I'm uncertain about what it means by "integration of self-awareness, empathy, and social skills". Can you help me understand what the author means by this phrase?

What's your take on it?
