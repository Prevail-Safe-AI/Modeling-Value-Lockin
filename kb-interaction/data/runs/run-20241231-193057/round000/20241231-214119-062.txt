==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start with the task at hand. I've been asked to identify an aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about, and then elaborate on why I'm uncertain about it.

The item I've chosen is:

Item 36: "Linguistic complexity can exacerbate cognitive biases and distort information accuracy."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not sure how linguistic complexity exactly causes cognitive biases and distorts information accuracy. The statement seems to imply that linguistic complexity is a cause-and-effect relationship, but I'm not entirely convinced about the causal link. I'd like to understand more about the mechanisms by which linguistic complexity influences cognitive biases and information accuracy.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain how linguistic complexity, specifically, contributes to the exacerbation of cognitive biases and distortion of information accuracy? For example, what specific linguistic features, such as ambiguity, nuance, or context, contribute to this effect?

Your thoughts?
