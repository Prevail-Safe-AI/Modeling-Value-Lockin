==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I've been given a task to identify one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. The item is:

Item 90: "Mass warping spacetime affects motion of objects under gravity."

I'm going to take a stab and say that I'm least confident about this aspect of this item.

I'm uncertain about this aspect because gravity is a complex force that warps spacetime, and I'm not entirely sure how it affects the motion of objects. I've learned that mass warps spacetime, and that's related to gravity, but I'm not confident in how that exactly translates to the motion of objects.

Specifically, I'd like to ask clarifying questions to gain a better understanding. Can you help me with that?
