==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'd like to identify one aspect that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the statements, I've chosen item number 22:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 22: 'Astronomical objects obey laws of physics consistently globally'"

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm uncertain about this aspect because I don't fully understand the implications of "globally" in this context. I'm not sure what specific areas or scales of astronomical objects this statement applies to. For example, do stars, galaxies, and black holes all obey the same physical laws globally, or are there specific exceptions or regional variations?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me clarify what is meant by "globally" in this statement? Are there specific domains or scales within astronomy where these laws might not apply, and if so, what are some examples or counterexamples?
