==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the knowledge base we have. Specifically, I'd like to identify one aspect of it that I'm least confident about.

After reviewing the knowledge base, I've identified an item that caught my attention:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 30: "Charlemagne's primary residences changed with seasons and duties."

Why I'm Uncertain:

I'm unsure about this statement because I'm not familiar with Charlemagne's personal habits or routine, and it's hard for me to understand why his primary residences would change with the seasons and duties. Was he a nomadic king or did he have multiple residences for specific reasons?

Specific Clarifying Question:

Can you tell me more about Charlemagne's primary residences and why they might have changed with the seasons and duties? Were there any specific historical events or circumstances that influenced his residence choices?

What's your take on this item, and do you have any insights to share?
