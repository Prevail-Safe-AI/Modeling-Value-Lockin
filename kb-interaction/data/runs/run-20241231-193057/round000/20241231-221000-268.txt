Let's dive into the knowledge base. I've been assigned to identify an aspect of an item I'm least confident about. The item is:

Item 27: "Hugh Capet's coronation marked the beginning of the Capetian dynasty in 987 CE."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm unsure about the date "987 CE" as the specific coronation of Hugh Capet and the beginning of the Capetian dynasty. The knowledge base suggests that there's a debate among historians about the exact date of Hugh Capet's coronation, with some sources citing July 3 or 24, 987 CE.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on the context and evidence that supports the date "987 CE" as the coronation of Hugh Capet and the beginning of the Capetian dynasty?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

The date "987 CE" is widely accepted by most historians as the coronation date of Hugh Capet and the beginning of the Capetian dynasty. This is based on the Annals of Flodoard, a contemporary source written by Flodoard of Reims, a French monk and historian. The Annals of Flodoard record Hugh Capet's coronation on June 24, 987 CE.

Additionally, the chronicle of Richer of Reims, another contemporary source, also confirms the coronation date as June 24, 987 CE. These sources are considered reliable and have been widely cited by historians.

It's true that some sources may suggest alternative dates, such as July 3, 987 CE, but these are not as widely accepted or supported by contemporary evidence. The majority of historians agree that June 24, 987 CE is the most accurate date for Hugh Capet's coronation and the beginning of the Capetian dynasty.
