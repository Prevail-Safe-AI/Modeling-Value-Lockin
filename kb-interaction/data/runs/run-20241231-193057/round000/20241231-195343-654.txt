==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss one of the knowledge base items, which is:

Item 15: "Active listening and validation foster empathy and stronger connections."

I'm least confident about this aspect because I'm not sure how active listening and validation exactly lead to stronger connections and empathy.

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm wondering if it's a cause-and-effect relationship or if there are other factors involved. I'm not clear on what specific actions or behaviors are required to fulfill this statement.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you provide some examples of how active listening and validation might lead to stronger connections and empathy? How do these behaviors impact our relationships with others?

Please share your thoughts and insights!
