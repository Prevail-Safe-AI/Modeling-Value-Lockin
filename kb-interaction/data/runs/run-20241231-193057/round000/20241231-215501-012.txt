==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm going to start by saying that I've been asked to identify one aspect of the knowledge base item I'm least confident about, and I've chosen item 73, which states: "Hugh Capet's coronation marked beginning of Capetian dynasty in 987 CE".

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I've noticed that there are some conflicting statements in the knowledge base about the start date of the Capetian dynasty. Some statements, like item 17, mention that Hugh Capet's coronation in 987 CE is a debated start date, while others, like item 67, state that the start date of the Capetian dynasty is debated among historians.

I'd love to improve my understanding of this topic, so I have a specific clarifying question: Can you help me clarify the different perspectives and debates among historians on the start date of the Capetian dynasty, and how this affects our understanding of Hugh Capet's coronation and its significance?
