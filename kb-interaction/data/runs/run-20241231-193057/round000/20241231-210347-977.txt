==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, I've been reviewing the knowledge base and I came across an item that I'm least confident about: 

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 44: "Certifications influence perceived value through social proof."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what "social proof" means in this context. Is it about how people perceive value because others have certified or endorsed something? If so, what mechanisms are at play that lead to this perceived value?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you define what you mean by "social proof" and how it contributes to certifications influencing perceived value?

What are your thoughts on this?
