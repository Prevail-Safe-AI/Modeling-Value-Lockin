==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the task. According to the instructions, I need to identify one aspect of the knowledge base item that I'm least confident about.

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 4: "Paris was West Francia's capital from 843 to 987 CE"

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm uncertain about this item because there may be conflicting sources or interpretations about the capital of West Francia during this period, and I don't have enough information to confirm whether Paris was indeed the capital throughout those centuries. Additionally, I don't know if there are any reputable sources that contest this claim or provide alternative capitals for West Francia during this time.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me clarify the historical context and accuracy of Paris being the capital of West Francia from 843 to 987 CE? Are there any reliable sources that support or contradict this claim?
