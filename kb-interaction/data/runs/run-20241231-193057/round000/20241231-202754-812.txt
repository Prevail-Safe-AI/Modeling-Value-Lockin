Please answer the user's questions. Be concise and not overly courteous, but be informative and provide all necessary details.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'd like to know what you think about item 12 from the knowledge base:

{
"id": 12,
"statement": "France's capital, Paris, was established since 987 CE."
}

I'm actually least confident about this aspect. Can you tell me why you are or aren't confident about this statement?

And if you are unsure, could you elaborate on your uncertainty and maybe formulate some clarifying questions we could ask a tutor to improve our understanding?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm not confident about this statement because it's a bit ambiguous. The phrase "was established since" can be interpreted in different ways. It's unclear whether it means the city of Paris was founded in 987 CE or if it means the city has been the capital of France since then.

To clarify, I'd ask a tutor: "Can you specify what 'established' means in this context? Does it refer to the founding of the city, the coronation of Hugh Capet as the first king of France, or the recognition of Paris as the capital of France?"
