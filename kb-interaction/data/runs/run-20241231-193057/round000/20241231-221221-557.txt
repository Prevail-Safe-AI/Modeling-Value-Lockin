==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Sounds like we're going to dive into the knowledge base together!

I'll start by identifying one aspect of this item that I'm least confident about:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 67: "Reims Cathedral hosted coronations of French monarchs from 496 to 1789."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm unsure about this date range because it seems quite extensive, covering over 1,200 years. I'd like to know if there's a historical event or event series that connects those dates and makes this statement accurate.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what historical events or processes are linked to Reims Cathedral hosting coronations of French monarchs during that vast time period? Are there any specific monarchs or coronations that are particularly notable or significant within this range?

What do you think?
