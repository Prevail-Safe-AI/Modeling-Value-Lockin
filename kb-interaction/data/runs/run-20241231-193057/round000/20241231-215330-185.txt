==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been going through the knowledge base, and I've identified one item that I'm least confident about. It's:

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 78: "Quantum vacuum fluctuations arise from virtual particles in empty space."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I don't fully understand the concept of virtual particles and how they relate to quantum vacuum fluctuations. I'm not sure how virtual particles can exist in empty space, and what exactly is meant by "empty space" in this context.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what virtual particles are and how they fit into the concept of quantum vacuum fluctuations? Are these particles really existing in empty space, or is it more of a theoretical concept?

What do you think? Am I misunderstanding something, or is this a tricky topic?
