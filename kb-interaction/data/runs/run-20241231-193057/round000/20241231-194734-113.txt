I am your partner. Please start the conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

I'll start by asking about one of the items in the knowledge base. Could you help me identify one aspect of item 27 that you're least confident about?

Item 27 states: "Establish clear expectations and use inclusive language to build trust".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Item 27. According to my training data, I'm least confident about the specific strategies for using inclusive language to build trust. While I can provide general guidelines on inclusive language, I may not be able to offer tailored advice on how to apply it in a particular context or industry.Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
Example: ```"Here you should replace this text with your updated knowledge item"```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

```"Effective communication fosters trust through respectful and empathetic dialogue."```
