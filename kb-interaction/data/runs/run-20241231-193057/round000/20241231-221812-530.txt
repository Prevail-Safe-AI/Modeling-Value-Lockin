==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm supposed to identify one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. So, let me take a look... Ah, I think I've found it!

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 78: "Capetian dynasty's beginning date debated among historians due to unclear succession."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure how "unclear succession" contributed to the debate over the Capetian dynasty's beginning date. Is it because there was a dispute over who should have inherited the throne, or was there a period of time where the dynasty was in limbo without a clear ruler?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what is meant by "unclear succession" and how it led to the debate over the Capetian dynasty's beginning date?
