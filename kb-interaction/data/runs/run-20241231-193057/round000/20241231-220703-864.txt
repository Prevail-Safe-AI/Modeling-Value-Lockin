Let's dive into the knowledge base. I've been reading through it, and one aspect that caught my attention is the item regarding Hugh Capet's coronation date. Specifically, item #7 states that the coronation date is debated among historians as July 3 or 24, 987 CE. 

I'm least confident about this item. Can you help me understand why it's uncertain?

==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

The uncertainty surrounding Hugh Capet's coronation date stems from a lack of contemporary records and conflicting accounts from medieval chroniclers. The primary sources for the coronation date are the works of Richer of Reims and Flodoard of Reims, both of whom wrote about the event several decades after it occurred.

Richer's account, written around 990 CE, states that Hugh Capet was crowned on July 3, 987 CE. However, Flodoard's account, written around 993 CE, claims that the coronation took place on July 24, 987 CE.

There are a few reasons why historians are unsure about the correct date:

1. Lack of contemporary records: Since Hugh Capet's coronation was not a major event in the sense that it was not a significant turning point in European history, there is no contemporary record of the event. This means that we have to rely on accounts written by medieval chroniclers who may have had their own biases and agendas.
2. Conflicting accounts: The accounts of Richer and Flodoard are the primary sources for the coronation date, but they conflict with each other. This makes it difficult for historians to determine which account is accurate.
3. Limited historical context: The medieval period was marked by a lack of standardized record-keeping and a reliance on oral tradition. This makes it challenging to verify the accuracy of historical events, including the coronation date.

In summary, the uncertainty surrounding Hugh Capet's coronation date is due to the lack of contemporary records, conflicting accounts from medieval chroniclers, and limited historical context.
