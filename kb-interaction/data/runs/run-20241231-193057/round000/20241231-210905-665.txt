Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'd like to explore our shared knowledge base. What aspect of the item: ```
{
  "id": 64,
  "statement": "Reims Cathedral hosted 25 French monarch coronations from 1027"
}
``` are you least confident about?

Let me know your thoughts!<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm least confident about the accuracy of the specific number "25" in the statement. While Reims Cathedral is indeed a significant location for French monarch coronations, I don't have a precise count of the number of coronations held there.
