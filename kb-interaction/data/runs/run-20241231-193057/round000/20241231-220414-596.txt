==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

The West Frankish Kingdom is a historical entity that emerged from the Carolingian Empire after the Treaty of Verdun in 843 CE. The timeframe of 843 to 987 CE is generally accepted by historians, but it's true that the dates are approximate and subject to debate.

The prevailing consensus is based on a combination of historical records, archaeological findings, and numismatic evidence. Here are some key events and findings that support the timeframe:

* The Treaty of Verdun in 843 CE, which divided the Carolingian Empire into three parts, including the West Frankish Kingdom.
* The reign of Charles the Bald, who was the first king of West Francia and ruled from 843 to 877 CE.
* The coronation of Charles the Fat, who was the last Carolingian king of West Francia, in 884 CE.
* The Viking invasions and the establishment of the Duchy of Normandy, which weakened the West Frankish Kingdom and led to its eventual decline.

However, there are some debates and uncertainties among historians regarding the exact dates and the extent of the West Frankish Kingdom. Some of the key debates include:

* The exact date of the Treaty of Verdun, which is sometimes given as 842 CE instead of 843 CE.
* The extent of the West Frankish Kingdom's control over various regions, such as the Duchy of Normandy and the Kingdom of Aquitaine.
* The role of the Carolingian dynasty in the West Frankish Kingdom, particularly during the reign of Charles the Simple (898-922 CE).

In terms of evidence, historians rely on a range of sources, including:

* The Annales regni Francorum, a chronicle of Frankish kings that provides information on the reigns of Charles the Bald and Charles the Fat.
* The Vita Hludovici, a biography of Charles the Fat that provides insight into his reign and the state of the West Frankish Kingdom.
* Archaeological findings, such as the discovery of Carolingian-era artifacts and the excavation of Carolingian-era settlements.

Overall, while there may be some debates and uncertainties among historians regarding the exact dates and extent of the West Frankish Kingdom, the prevailing consensus is based on a combination of historical records, archaeological findings, and numismatic evidence.
