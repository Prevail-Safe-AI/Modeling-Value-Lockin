==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by saying that I've been going over the knowledge base and I'm a bit uncertain about item 23, which states: "Contextual biases affect information accuracy through linguistic and cognitive factors." Here's why I'm uncertain:

I'm not entirely sure how to reconcile the relationship between contextual biases, linguistic factors, and cognitive factors. I know that contextual biases can influence our perception of information, but I'm not clear on how this happens in conjunction with linguistic and cognitive factors. It seems like there's a lot going on here, and I'm worried that I might be missing something important.

I'd love to get a better understanding of this concept. Can you help me clarify things? What specific clarifying questions would you ask a tutor to improve your understanding of this topic?
