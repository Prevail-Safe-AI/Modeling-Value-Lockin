==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Reims was a significant ceremonial center for French monarch coronations due to its historical and symbolic significance. The city was the site of the coronation of French kings from the 10th to the 20th century, with the first coronation taking place in 816. The city's cathedral, Notre-Dame de Reims, was the traditional location of the coronation ceremony, and it was seen as a symbol of French monarchy and state.

Reims was chosen as the coronation site because of its proximity to the royal court and its central location in the kingdom. The city was also seen as a symbol of French identity and culture, and the coronation ceremony was an important ritual that reinforced the monarch's legitimacy and connection to the French people.

As for the difference between a ceremonial center and a capital, a ceremonial center is a location that holds significant symbolic or ritual importance, often tied to a particular institution or tradition. In the case of Reims, the city was a ceremonial center for French monarch coronations, but it was not the capital of France. The capital of France has historically been Paris, which has served as the seat of government and the center of French politics and administration.

In summary, Reims was a ceremonial center for French monarch coronations due to its historical and symbolic significance, as well as its proximity to the royal court and central location in the kingdom. The city's cathedral was the traditional location of the coronation ceremony, and it was seen as a symbol of French monarchy and state.
