==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Reims Cathedral has indeed been the site of many French monarch coronations. According to historical records, Reims Cathedral has been the traditional coronation site for French monarchs since the 10th century. The cathedral has hosted the coronations of 25 French monarchs, including Charles de Gaulle, who was the last French monarch to be crowned there in 1953.

The accuracy of this statement can be confirmed through various historical sources, including:

1. The official website of Reims Cathedral, which states that the cathedral has been the site of 25 coronations.
2. The French National Archives, which hold records of the coronations and other historical events that took place at the cathedral.
3. Historical accounts and books written by reputable historians, such as "The Coronation of the French Monarchs" by historian and author, Jean-Pierre Babelon.

It's worth noting that the coronation of French monarchs was a significant event in French history, and the cathedral's role in this process is well-documented.
