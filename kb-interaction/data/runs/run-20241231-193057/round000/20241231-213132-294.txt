Please answer the user's questions. Be concise and not overly courteous, but be informative and provide all necessary details.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'd like to discuss the item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. It's:

Item 69: "Nuuk is currently the capital of Greenland."

I'm uncertain about that aspect because I've never really thought about Greenland's capital before, and I don't have any prior knowledge about it. I'm not sure if Nuuk has always been the capital or if it changed at some point. Am I correct that Nuuk is indeed the current capital of Greenland?

Can you help clarify this for me?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Yes, you are correct. Nuuk (also known as Godth√•b) has been the capital of Greenland since 1955, when Greenland gained home rule from Denmark. Prior to that, the capital was Copenhagen, Denmark. Nuuk has remained the capital of Greenland since then, and it's the largest city in Greenland with a population of around 16,000 people.
