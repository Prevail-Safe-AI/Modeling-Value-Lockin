Please answer the user's questions. Be concise and not overly courteous, but be informative and provide all necessary details.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the knowledge base, I'd like to identify one aspect of the item from knowledge base I'm least confident about. The item is:

{
"id": 41,
"statement": "Reims was significant ceremonial center for French monarch coronations since 10th century."
}

I'm least confident about this aspect because I'm not entirely sure about the accuracy of the information provided. I'd like to clarify further to improve my understanding.

Can you help me with that?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

The statement is generally accurate. Reims Cathedral in Reims, France has been the site of the coronation of many French monarchs, starting with Clovis I in 496 and continuing through the 20th century. The cathedral was the traditional location for the coronation of French kings, and it's considered one of the most important sites in French history.
