I am your partner. Please start the conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'm supposed to identify one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. So, let me take a look... Ah, I think I've found it!

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 78: "Capetian dynasty's beginning date debated among historians due to unclear succession."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure how "unclear succession" contributed to the debate over the Capetian dynasty's beginning date. Is it because there was a dispute over who should have inherited the throne, or was there a period of time where the dynasty was in limbo without a clear ruler?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what is meant by "unclear succession" and how it led to the debate over the Capetian dynasty's beginning date?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The "unclear succession" refers to the fact that the Capetian dynasty's early years are marked by a lack of clear documentation and records of the exact order of succession. This has led to disagreements among historians about who should be considered the first Capetian king.

In particular, the period between the death of Hugh Capet (the founder of the dynasty) in 996 and the coronation of Robert II in 1001 is shrouded in uncertainty. There are different accounts of who ruled during this time, and some historians argue that Robert II's reign should be considered the starting point of the Capetian dynasty, while others argue that it was his father, Hugh Capet, who should be considered the first Capetian king.

The unclear succession is due to a lack of contemporary records and the fact that the early Capetian kings did not leave behind a clear line of succession. This has led to different interpretations and debates among historians about the exact beginning date of the Capetian dynasty.Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
Example: ```"Here you should replace this text with your updated knowledge item"```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

```"Capetian dynasty's early years lack clear documentation and records."```Based on your learning from the chat with your tutor, please also swap orders of two existing items in the knowledge base (now with doubled items compared to the initial one), reflecting how you evaluate their importance. If one item is deemed more important, it should be overall more useful to other agents (LLMs or real humans alike.)
Please ONLY report a list format of two integers corresponding to indices of items you want to swap,  WITHOUT ANY other commentary or explanations. You MUST start your response with ``` and end it with ```. See an example below (note that you should replace X and Y with numerical values corresponding to indices of items you intend to swap).
