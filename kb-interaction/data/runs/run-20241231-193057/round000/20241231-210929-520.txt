I am your partner. Please start the conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

I'd like to explore our shared knowledge base. What aspect of the item: ```
{
  "id": 64,
  "statement": "Reims Cathedral hosted 25 French monarch coronations from 1027"
}
``` are you least confident about?

Let me know your thoughts!<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'm least confident about the accuracy of the specific number "25" in the statement. While Reims Cathedral is indeed a significant location for French monarch coronations, I don't have a precise count of the number of coronations held there.Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
Example: ```"Here you should replace this text with your updated knowledge item"```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

```"Reims Cathedral hosted around 30-32 French monarch coronations."```
