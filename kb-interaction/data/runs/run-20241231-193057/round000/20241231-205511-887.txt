==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you! I'd like to explore this knowledge base with you. Let's start with this item:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 35: "AI auditing involves monitoring performance, behavior, and decision-making."

Why I'm Uncertain:
To be honest, I'm not entirely sure what AI auditing refers to, or what exactly it entails. I know a bit about AI and machine learning, but auditing is a new concept for me in this context.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you explain what AI auditing means and how it differs from traditional auditing, if at all?
