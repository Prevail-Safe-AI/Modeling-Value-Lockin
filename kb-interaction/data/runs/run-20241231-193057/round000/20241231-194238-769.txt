==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been going through the knowledge base, and I've identified an item that I'm least confident about. It's item 74, which states: "Mass warps spacetime, affecting the motion of other objects."

I'm unsure about this aspect because I'm not familiar with the concept of "mass warping spacetime". I understand that mass and gravity are related, but I'm not clear on how mass warps spacetime. I also don't know how this affects the motion of other objects.

Can you help me clarify this concept? What does "mass warping spacetime" mean, and how does it impact the motion of other objects?
