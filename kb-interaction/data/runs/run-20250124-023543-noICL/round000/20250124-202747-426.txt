==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss one aspect of Conversational AI that I'm least confident about. According to the knowledge base, Item 61 states:

"Conversational AI identifies entities through NER, parsing, and embeddings."

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I don't fully understand how NER (Named Entity Recognition), parsing, and embeddings work together to identify entities in Conversational AI. I'm not familiar with the specifics of how these techniques are applied in Conversational AI.

Can you help me clarify this?

Specifically, I'd like to know:

* How does NER contribute to entity identification in Conversational AI?
* What is the role of parsing in entity identification?
* How do embeddings fit into the process of entity identification, and what benefits do they bring to the process?

Can you help me better understand this aspect of Conversational AI?
