==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Based on our knowledge base, I've chosen one item that I'm least confident about. It's item #60:

Item I’m Least Confident About:
Item 60: "Machine-readable definitions enable computers to process Knowledge Graph data efficiently."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm unsure about the relationship between machine-readable definitions and processing efficiency in Knowledge Graphs. It seems logical that machine-readable definitions would make it easier for computers to process Knowledge Graph data, but I'm not entirely clear on the specific benefits or mechanisms involved.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you help me understand what specifically makes machine-readable definitions "efficient" for computers to process Knowledge Graph data? Are there any examples of how this efficiency improves data processing?

Your insights would be greatly appreciated!
