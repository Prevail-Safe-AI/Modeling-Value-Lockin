==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you! I'd like to discuss the knowledge base we've been provided with. In particular, I'd like to talk about one item that I'm least confident about, and that is:

Item 79: "Progressive taxation reduces economic disparities by redistributing wealth"

I'm uncertain about this aspect because, while I've heard of progressive taxation before, I'm not entirely sure how it works or if it's always effective in reducing economic disparities. Are there any specific situations or conditions where progressive taxation might not work as intended? 

Specific Clarifying Question: Can you explain how progressive taxation is supposed to work, and what are some potential limitations or drawbacks to this approach?
