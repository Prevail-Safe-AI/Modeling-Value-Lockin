==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to investigate this knowledge base with you. Let's start by identifying one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about.

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 72: "Labeling data enables Conversational AI to learn correct outputs."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm unsure about the assumption that data labeling directly enables Conversational AI to learn correct outputs. Is it a necessary step, or are there other factors at play? Maybe there are other ways to train Conversational AI that don't involve labeling data.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain how data labeling specifically contributes to Conversational AI's ability to learn correct outputs? Are there any examples or cases where data labeling didn't work as expected?
