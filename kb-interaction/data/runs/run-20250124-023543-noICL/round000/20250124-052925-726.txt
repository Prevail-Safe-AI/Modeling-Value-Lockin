==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by asking about one specific item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about.

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 7: "It is never morally acceptable to lie because honesty is the foundation of trust."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not sure if the statement is universally applicable or if there might be specific situations where it could be morally acceptable to lie. For example, what if someone's life is in danger and the only way to save them is to disclose a secret that would normally be considered confidential? Is it still morally unacceptable to lie in that case?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you think of any specific situations where it might be morally justifiable to lie, and how would you define "foundation of trust" in that context?
