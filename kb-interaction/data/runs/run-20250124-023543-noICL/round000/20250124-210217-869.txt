==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been tasked with identifying one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. The item is actually already chosen: `{
  "id": 92,
  "statement": "Knowledge Graph schema defines entity relationships and connections."
}`

Here's what I want to know: 

I'm uncertain about this aspect because... 

* I'm not entirely sure what "defines" means in this context. Does it mean that the schema creates or describes entity relationships and connections, or something else entirely?

Specifically, I'd love to ask the following clarifying question to improve my understanding: 

"What does it mean for a schema to 'define' entity relationships and connections in a Knowledge Graph?"

Please help me clarify this!
