==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I've been reviewing the statements, and I'd like to identify one aspect that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the statements, I'd like to explore the item with the statement:

{
"id": 97,
"statement": "Synaptic plasticity enables adaptive neural networks through distributed processing."
}

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not fully understanding how exactly synaptic plasticity leads to adaptive neural networks through distributed processing. It seems like a crucial concept in understanding how our brain works, but the phrase "distributed processing" is a bit vague to me.

Can you help me clarify this?
