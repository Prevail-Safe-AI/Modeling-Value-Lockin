==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base! I'd like to identify one aspect of this item that I'm least confident about:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 87: "Epigenetic regulation involves accessory chromatin structure modification synergy."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what "accessory chromatin structure" means in this context. Is it related to the components of chromatin, such as histones or nucleosomes? How does this modification occur, and what's the significance of synergy in epigenetic regulation?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what you mean by "accessory chromatin structure" and how it relates to epigenetic regulation? How does this concept clarify the role of chromatin structure modifications in gene expression?
