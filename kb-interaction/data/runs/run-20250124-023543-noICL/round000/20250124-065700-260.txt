==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss an item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. It's item 99:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 99: "Socialization influences others through actions, words, attitudes and values"

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not sure if this statement is a complete or accurate explanation of how socialization affects others. It seems like a good start, but I'm not convinced that it covers all the possible ways socialization can influence people. I'd like more information or clarification on what these actions, words, attitudes, and values might look like in different social situations.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you give some examples of how socialization influences others through these different forms, and how they might interact with each other?"

What are your thoughts on this?
