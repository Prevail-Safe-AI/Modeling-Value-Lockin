==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into it!

Iten I'm Least Confident About:
Item 33: "A Knowledge Graph is a graph structure storing entities' relationships."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what exactly makes a Knowledge Graph a "graph structure". Is it just a visual representation or is it more complex than that?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what you mean by "graph structure" in this context? Are there any specific properties or characteristics that define a Knowledge Graph as a graph structure?

Please let me know!
