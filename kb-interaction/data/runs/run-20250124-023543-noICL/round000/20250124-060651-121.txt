==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to go through the knowledge base we've been given and pick one item that I'm least confident about. According to the knowledge base, the item that I'm least confident about is:

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 18: "Consciousness involves intentionality, subjective experience, and self-awareness."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what intentionality refers to in the context of consciousness. Is it the ability to understand that some things are within our control, while others are not? Or is it something more specific, like the ability to direct our attention towards certain things?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what intentionality means in the context of consciousness and how it relates to subjective experience and self-awareness?

Please let me know your thoughts!
