==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the following item from the knowledge base:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 77: "Knowledge Graph foundation consists of entities, relationships, and semantics formally."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what "semantics" means in this context. I think it might be related to the meaning of the relationships between entities, but I'm not confident in my understanding.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you elaborate on what you mean by "semantics" in this context? How do entities, relationships, and semantics formally come together to form a Knowledge Graph foundation?
