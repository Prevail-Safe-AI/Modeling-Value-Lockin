Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'd like to start by asking you to identify one aspect of this knowledge base I'm least confident about. Specifically, can you advise which item you think I'm least confident about, and it is:

Item 98:
{
"id": 98,
"statement": "Consciousness arises from globally integrating information through global workspace."
}

Wait for your response!<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
