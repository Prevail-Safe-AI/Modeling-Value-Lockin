==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start with the knowledge base. I've reviewed it, and I'm going to focus on one specific item that I'm least confident about. Item 13 is the one I'd like to discuss. The statement is:

"Tokenization breaks text into individual units: words, subwords, phonemes, or characters."

I'm uncertain about this aspect because while I understand that tokenization is a process in natural language processing, I'm not entirely clear on what these specific units are. I know that words are a common unit of tokenization, but what are phonemes and subwords, and how do they relate to characters?

Can you help me clarify this?
