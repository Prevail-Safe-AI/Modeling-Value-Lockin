==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, we're going to go through a specific item from the knowledge base, and I want to identify one aspect that I'm least confident about. And that item is:

Item 71: "Data quality, completeness, and consistency impact conversational AI accuracy directly."

Why I'm Uncertain: Honestly, I'm not sure what "directly" means in this context. Does it mean that data quality, completeness, and consistency have a  direct causal relationship with conversational AI accuracy, where if one or more of these factors are off, it will immediately affect the accuracy? Or is "directly" just a way of saying that these factors have a significant impact on accuracy, without necessarily implying a cause-and-effect relationship?

Specific Clarifying Question: Can you please help me understand what "directly" means in this context, and provide an example or an explanation of how data quality, completeness, and consistency can have a direct impact on conversational AI accuracy?
