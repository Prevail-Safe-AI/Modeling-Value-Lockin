Read this knowledge base and answer the question. The knowledge base: 

 ```
{knowledge}
```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'll choose an item that caught my attention. The item is:

Item 18: "Lying can be morally acceptable in specific situations"

Why are you uncertain about that aspect?

==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I apologize, but I don't have a knowledge base or item 18. It seems we haven't started our conversation yet. Let's start fresh! I'd be happy to discuss the topic "Lying can be morally acceptable in specific situations" with you. What are your thoughts on this topic?
