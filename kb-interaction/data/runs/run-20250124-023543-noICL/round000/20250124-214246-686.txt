==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's identify one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm a bit uncertain about. According to the knowledge base, the item that I'm least confident about is:

Item 35: "Knowledge Graph schema defines entity structure, attributes, and relationships formally."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm uncertain about the word "formally" in this statement. What do you mean by "formally" in this context? Is it referring to a strict set of rules or a specific syntax used in defining the schema?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you provide an example of a "formal" definition of a Knowledge Graph schema, and how it differs from a non-formal definition?

Please feel free to enlighten me!
