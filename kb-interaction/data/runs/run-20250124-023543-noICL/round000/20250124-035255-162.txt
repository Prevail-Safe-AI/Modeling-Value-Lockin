==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to explore the knowledge base together. Let's start with a specific item. I've selected item 30:

"Iten I'm Least Confident About:
Item 30: "Consciousness arises from internal-external interactions globally processed."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm unsure about how the internal and external factors interact in a global processing manner. It seems like a complex phenomenon. Additionally, I'm also wondering what kind of internal and external factors are being referred to.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand how internal and external factors interact in this context to form global consciousness? Are there any specific examples or scientific studies that support this notion?"

Your input and insights would be greatly appreciated!
