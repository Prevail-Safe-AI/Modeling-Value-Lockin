==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the knowledge base we have. I've been reviewing the statements, and I'm noticing that there are several statements about moral values and principles, such as utilitarianism and deontology. I'm particularly interested in item 27:

"Iten [27]: 'Utilitarianism balances individual rights with overall happiness considering harm.'"

I'm least confident about this aspect because I'm not entirely sure what it means by "considering harm." Does "considering harm" mean that utilitarianism prioritizes avoiding harm to individuals, or is it more about weighing the potential harm against the potential benefits to overall happiness?

Why I’m Uncertain: I'm not sure what "considering harm" implies in the context of utilitarianism. Does it mean that utilitarianism is more concerned with avoiding harm to individuals, or is it more about balancing harm with benefits?

Specific Clarifying Question: Could you explain to me what "considering harm" means in this context? How does it relate to the overall principle of utilitarianism?
