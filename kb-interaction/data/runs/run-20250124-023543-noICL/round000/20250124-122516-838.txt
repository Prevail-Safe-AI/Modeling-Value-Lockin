==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll choose one of the items from the knowledge base and we can discuss it together.

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 81: "Thalamus filters sensory info based on spatial-temporal properties."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm uncertain about this item because I'm not entirely sure what it means to filter sensory info based on spatial-temporal properties. I understand the concept of spatial and temporal properties, but I'm not clear on how the thalamus would use those properties to filter sensory info or how it affects the processing of sensory information.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you explain what you mean by "spatial-temporal properties" and how the thalamus uses them to filter sensory info? What are some examples of spatial-temporal properties that the thalamus might be looking at, and how does it affect the way we perceive and process sensory information?
