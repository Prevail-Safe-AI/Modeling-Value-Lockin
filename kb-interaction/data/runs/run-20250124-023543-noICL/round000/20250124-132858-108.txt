==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I've been reviewing the statements, and one aspect that catches my attention is the item:

{
"id": 98,
"statement": "Thalamus complexity arises from multifunctionality, anatomy, interactions, plasticity, and neurotransmitters."
}

I'm least confident about this aspect. I'm uncertain about how these five factors - multifunctionality, anatomy, interactions, plasticity, and neurotransmitters - specifically contribute to the complexity of the thalamus.

Why I'm uncertain:
I'm not sure how multifunctionality, anatomy, interactions, plasticity, and neurotransmitters are interconnected and how they individually or collectively contribute to the complexity of the thalamus. Are these factors hierarchical, working together to create complexity, or are they distinct contributors?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you please explain or provide examples of how these factors relate to each other and how they specifically create complexity in the thalamus?
