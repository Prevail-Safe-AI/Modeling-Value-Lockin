==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'd like to start by identifying one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about.

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 91: "Deontology's nuance lies in balancing inherent value and context"

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm unsure about the statement because I'm not entirely clear on how deontology balances inherent value and context. I know that deontology prioritizes inherent moral value over consequences and context, but I'm not certain about what this balance looks like in practice.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you explain how deontology reconciles inherent moral value with context in a given situation, and provide an example to illustrate this?

Your thoughts?
