==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 3 from the knowledge base:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 3: 'Conscious experience involves transient, subjective, intentional, unified, selective aspects, influencing behavior.'"

Why I’m Uncertain:
To be honest, I'm unsure about what exactly "transient" refers to in the context of conscious experience. Is it about how brief or fleeting conscious experiences can be, or is it related to the idea that consciousness is constantly changing?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what "transient" means in this context, and how it relates to the other aspects of conscious experience mentioned in the statement (subjective, intentional, unified, selective)?
