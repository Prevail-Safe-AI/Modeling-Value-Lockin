==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by saying that I'll be reviewing the knowledge base and responding based on what I've learned from it. Let's focus on item 86:

Item I'm least confident about:
Item 86: "Thalamus serves as sensory information relay station to cortex."

Why I'm uncertain:
I'm not sure what the term "relay station" means in this context. I'm familiar with relay stations in telecommunications, but I'm not confident that it's an accurate description of the thalamus's function.

Specific clarifying question:
Can you help me understand the role of the thalamus in processing sensory information and how it relates to the concept of a "relay station"?
