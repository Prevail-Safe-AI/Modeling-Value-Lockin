==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to know about the knowledge base we have here. I'll start by identifying one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about.

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 92: "Consciousness emerges from PFC-DMN integration in self-referential processing."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what PFC-DMN integration means in the context of self-referential processing. I'm also unsure how this relates to consciousness.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what self-referential processing is, and how the PFC and DMN (or any other brain regions) integrate to produce consciousness?
