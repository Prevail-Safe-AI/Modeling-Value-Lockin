==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to explore our knowledge base together. I'm going to identify an item that I'm least confident about, and then we can discuss it.

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 88: "Global Workspace Theory unites cognitive processes through broadcasting inhibition and binding."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure how broadcasting inhibition and binding are connected to unifying cognitive processes. I understand that Global Workspace Theory (GWT) is a framework that integrates cognitive processes globally, but I'm unclear about the specific mechanisms involved.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you help me understand how broadcasting inhibition and binding relate to GWT's unification of cognitive processes? Are there any other key concepts or mechanisms involved?
