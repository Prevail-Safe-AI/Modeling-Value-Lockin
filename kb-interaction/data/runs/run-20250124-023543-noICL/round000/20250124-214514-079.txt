==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by asking about an item from the knowledge base. Specifically,

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 80: "Preprocessing, normalization, and stemming prepare text data for NLP analysis."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what the exact advantages of preprocessing, normalization, and stemming are, or how they specifically prepare text data for NLP analysis.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you explain in more detail why preprocessing, normalization, and stemming are important steps in preparing text data for NLP analysis, and how they improve the analysis?
