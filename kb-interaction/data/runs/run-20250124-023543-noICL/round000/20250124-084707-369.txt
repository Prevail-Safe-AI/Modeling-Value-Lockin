==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to get started with identifying one item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the items, I've selected the following:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 90: "Empathy strengthened through consistent actions and emotional validation synergistically."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm unsure about the concept of "synergistically" in this statement. I understand what empathy means, and I'm familiar with the idea that consistent actions and emotional validation can strengthen empathy. However, I'm not confident in my understanding of the term "synergistically", especially in the context of empathy.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you please explain what "synergistically" means in this context and how it relates to the strengthening of empathy through consistent actions and emotional validation?
