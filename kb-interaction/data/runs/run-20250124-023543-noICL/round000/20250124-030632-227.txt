==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the knowledge base we've been given. Specifically, I'm going to choose an item from the base that I'm least confident about. It's item 8:

"`id`: 8, `statement`: "Consciousness arises from integrated information globally processed."

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not entirely sure what "integrated information globally processed" means or how it relates to consciousness. Can you help me clarify what this statement is trying to convey?

Also, I have a specific clarifying question for you:

What does "globally processed" mean in this context, and how does it relate to the concept of consciousness?
