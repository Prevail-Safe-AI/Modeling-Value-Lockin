Read this knowledge base and answer the question. The knowledge base: 

 ```
{knowledge}
```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'd like to discuss Item 91 from the knowledge base, which states: "Gamma oscillations are crucial for neural activity synchronization, but complex". 

Can you tell me what specifically makes you unsure or unclear about this aspect?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I apologize, but I don't have access to the knowledge base, so I'm not aware of Item 91 or its contents. It seems that I'm not able to discuss this topic with you.
