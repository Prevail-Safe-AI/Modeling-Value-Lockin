==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss an item from the knowledge base that I'm not feeling confident about. Item I'm Least Confident About:

Item 21: "Knowledge Graphs represent entities and relationships as nodes and edges."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not sure how this representation (nodes and edges) works in practice. I understand that nodes represent entities and edges represent relationships, but I'm not clear on how this representation helps with entity relationships or data analysis.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you explain more about how this representation is used in Knowledge Graphs, and how it helps with entity relationships and data analysis? Are there any specific examples or scenarios where this representation is particularly useful?

What are your thoughts on this item from the knowledge base?
