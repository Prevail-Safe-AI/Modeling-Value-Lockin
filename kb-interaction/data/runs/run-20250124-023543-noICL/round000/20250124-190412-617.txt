==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been going through the knowledge base, and I've identified one aspect that I'm least confident about. It's item 61:

"Iten I'm Least Confident About:
Item 61: "Tokenization standardizes text into individual units for NLP analysis."

Why I'm Uncertain:

I'm not entirely sure how tokenization works in practice. I understand that it breaks text into individual units, but what kind of units are we talking about? Are they always single words, or can they be something more complex like phrases or characters? And how does this process help NLP analysis?

Specific Clarifying Question:

Can you explain how tokenization is performed, and what kind of units it typically breaks text into, and how does this process contribute to effective NLP analysis?"

What's your take on this?
