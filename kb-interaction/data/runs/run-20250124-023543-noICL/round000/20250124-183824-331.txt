==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. The item is:

{
"id": 69,
"statement": "Synergy refers to collective outcome of interacting factors."
}

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not entirely sure what the term "collective outcome" means in the context of synergy. To me, synergy means the interaction or cooperation of two or more agents, systems, or elements that produces an effect or output that is greater than the sum of their individual contributions.

Can you help clarify the meaning of "collective outcome" in this context?
