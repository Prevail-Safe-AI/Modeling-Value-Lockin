==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been going through the knowledge base, and I've come across an item that's making me a bit unsure. It's item 80:

"Individual differences influence cultural norms internalization through selective attention."

I'm not confident about this aspect because I'm not entirely clear on how individual differences can influence cultural norms internalization through selective attention. I understand that individual differences can affect how people perceive and respond to cultural norms, but I'm not sure how selective attention fits into the picture.

Can you help me understand this better? Maybe you can provide more context or explain why you think individual differences and selective attention are important factors in cultural norms internalization?
