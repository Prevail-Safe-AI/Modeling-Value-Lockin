==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to identify one aspect from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the items, I've found one that I'd like to discuss.

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 43: "Honesty's suitability varies with context, relationships, and desired outcomes."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm unsure about the exact scope of "context" in this statement. Is it referring to a specific cultural, societal, or personal context? Are there any particular scenarios or situations where honesty is more or less suitable? Additionally, I'm not clear on how "desired outcomes" fit into the equation. Are they referring to specific goals or consequences that arise from being honest?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what you mean by "context" in this statement? For example, are there specific cultural or societal norms that influence the suitability of honesty in certain situations?
