==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to know more about our knowledge base. Specifically, I've been reviewing it and I'm not entirely confident about one aspect. It's the statement:

"Item 60: Honesty's limitations arise in emotionally charged situations, considering empathy."

Can you help me understand why I'm unsure about this aspect?

(I'll wait for your response before elaborating on my uncertainties and asking specific clarifying questions.)
