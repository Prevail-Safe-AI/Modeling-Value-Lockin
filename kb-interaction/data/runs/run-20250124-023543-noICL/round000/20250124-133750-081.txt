==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been reviewing our knowledge base, and I've come across an item that I'm least confident about. It's:

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 98: "Thalamus harmonizes sensory, attentional, and emotional processes through complex neural interactions."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what "harmonizes" means in this context. Is it a precise scientific term, or is it a more general way of describing the thalamus's function?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what "harmonizes" means in this context, and how it relates to the thalamus's role in processing sensory, attentional, and emotional information?
