==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm not very confident about. Item 63 states: "Mental representations influence brain activity through synchronized neural oscillations."

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not fully understanding the relationship between mental representations and neural oscillations. Specifically, I don't know how synchronized neural oscillations specifically contribute to the influence of mental representations on brain activity.

Can you help me clarify this concept further?
