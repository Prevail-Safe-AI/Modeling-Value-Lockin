I am your partner. Please start the conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'd like to discuss one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. It's the item:

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 86: "Human morality is subjective and context-dependent across cultures."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm unsure about the extent to which morality can be considered subjective and context-dependent across all cultures. I know that different cultures have different values and norms, but I'm not convinced that this means morality is purely subjective and context-dependent. I'd like to know more about how this claim is supported by research and whether there are any counterarguments that suggest morality is more absolute or universal.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you provide examples of moral values or principles that are considered absolute or universal across different cultures, and how do these challenge the claim that human morality is purely subjective and context-dependent?

What are your thoughts on this?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The age-old debate about morality!

You're right to question the extent to which morality can be considered subjective and context-dependent across all cultures. While it's true that different cultures have different values and norms, there are also some moral principles that are widely accepted and considered absolute or universal.

One example is the concept of harm and non-maleficence, which is reflected in the Hippocratic oath and is widely accepted across cultures. The principle of "do no harm" is considered a fundamental moral principle in many cultures, and it's difficult to imagine a culture that would condone intentionally causing harm to others.

Another example is the concept of justice, which is often considered a universal moral principle. The idea of fairness, equality, and impartiality is widely accepted across cultures, and is reflected in laws and institutions that aim to promote justice and protect the rights of individuals.

These examples challenge the claim that human morality is purely subjective and context-dependent, as they suggest that there are some moral principles that are widely accepted and considered absolute or universal.

However, it's also important to note that even within cultures that accept these universal moral principles, there can be significant variations in how they are applied and interpreted. For example, what constitutes harm or justice can vary significantly across different cultures and contexts.

In terms of research, there are many studies that have explored the cross-cultural variability of moral values and principles. For example, one study found that while there are significant differences in moral values across cultures, there are also some commonalities, such as a strong emphasis on fairness and cooperation (Graham et al., 2011).

Another study found that even in cultures that are often considered to be highly individualistic, such as the United States, there is still a strong emphasis on moral principles such as fairness and justice (Haidt et al., 2009).

Overall, while there is some evidence to suggest that morality is subjective and context-dependent, there are also some moral principles that are widely accepted and considered absolute or universal. It's likely that the truth lies somewhere in between, and that morality is complex and multifaceted.

Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
Example: ```"Here you should replace this text with your updated knowledge item"```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

```"Morality is complex, with universal and context-dependent aspects."```Based on your learning from the chat with your tutor, please also rearrange the order of one existing item in the knowledge base (now with doubled items compared to the initial knowledge base), reflecting how you evaluate their importance. If one item is deemed more/less important, it should be overall more/less useful to other agents (LLMs or real humans alike.)
Please ONLY report a list format of two integers, WITHOUT ANY other commentary or explanations. The first int in the list refers to the "id" of knowledge item you intend to relocate; whereas the second int refers to the destination index you intend to insert this item. You MUST start your response with ``` and end it with ```.
