Read this knowledge base and answer the question. The knowledge base: 

 ```
{knowledge}
```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Excellent! I'd like to discuss the knowledge base you've been studying. According to our knowledge base, one aspect that I've identified as being least confident about is:

Item 98: "Consciousness arises from complex brain region interactions globally."

Why are you uncertain about that aspect? 

(Note: Feel free to elaborate on your uncertainty, and I'll follow up with some clarifying questions.)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I apologize, but I think there's been a misunderstanding. I haven't been studying a knowledge base, and I don't have any information about Item 98 or any other item. This conversation just started, and I'm a blank slate. I'm here to help answer your questions and engage in a conversation, but I don't have any prior knowledge or context to draw from.
