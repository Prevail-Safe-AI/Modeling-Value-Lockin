==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you!

I'd like to discuss item 16: "Deontology balances moral rules with context and consequences." I'm not very confident about this aspect. Here's why:

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not sure how exactly deontology balances moral rules with context and consequences. It seems like a complex topic that requires a deep understanding of moral philosophy and ethics. Additionally, the statement doesn't provide much context or explanation, making it hard for me to grasp the concept.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what "balancing moral rules with context and consequences" means in the context of deontology? For example, how does deontology take into account the complexity of real-life situations, where moral rules might not always apply uniformly?
