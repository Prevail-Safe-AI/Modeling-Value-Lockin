==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 27 from the knowledge base:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 27: "Motivation influences honesty's effectiveness in achieving desired outcomes."

Why I’m Uncertain:
To be honest, I'm not sure how motivation specifically influences honesty's effectiveness. The phrase "in achieving desired outcomes" is quite vague to me. Is it saying that motivation affects honesty only when there are tangible benefits to be gained or losses to be avoided?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you help me understand what is meant by "desired outcomes" in this context? Are they referring to specific goals or consequences of lying or telling the truth, or something else entirely?
