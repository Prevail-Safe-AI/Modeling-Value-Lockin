==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been analyzing the knowledge base, and I came across an item that I'm least confident about. Let's take a closer look at it:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 75: "Synchronization refers to the coordinated brain activity integration."

Why I'm Uncertain:

* This statement seems straightforward, but I'm not entirely sure what "coordinated brain activity integration" means. Is it a specific process or mechanism in the brain that we're talking about?
* I'm also not clear on how synchronization relates to consciousness and the brain's global workspace. Is it a necessary step for conscious experience to arise?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what you mean by "coordinated brain activity integration" and how it relates to synchronization and consciousness?

What are your thoughts on this item?
