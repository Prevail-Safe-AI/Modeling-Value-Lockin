==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's get started!

I've been reviewing the knowledge base, and I've identified one aspect that I'm least confident about. It's item 11:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 11: "Morality of lying depends on context, motivations, and consequences."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm unsure about how these three factors - context, motivations, and consequences - are weighted in determining the morality of lying. Are they equally important, or is one factor more significant than the others?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand how these factors interact and influence one another in determining the morality of lying? For example, if the context is emergency medical treatment, is the morality of lying more focused on the consequences of the lie, or the motivations behind it?"
