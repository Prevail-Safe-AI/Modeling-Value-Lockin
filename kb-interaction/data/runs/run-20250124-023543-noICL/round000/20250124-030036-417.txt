Read this knowledge base and answer the question. The knowledge base: 

 ```
{knowledge}
```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'd like to know more about our knowledge base. Specifically, I've been reviewing it and I'm not entirely confident about one aspect. It's the statement:

"Item 60: Honesty's limitations arise in emotionally charged situations, considering empathy."

Can you help me understand why I'm unsure about this aspect?

(I'll wait for your response before elaborating on my uncertainties and asking specific clarifying questions.)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
