==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by analyzing the knowledge base and identifying one aspect that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the statements, I've found the following item:

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 94: "Consciousness arises from integrating neural activity globally through oscillations."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm unsure about this statement because, while I understand that oscillations play a crucial role in neural activity, I'm not entirely convinced that they directly contribute to the emergence of consciousness. I'm wondering if the statement is oversimplifying the complex relationship between oscillations, neural activity, and consciousness.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you elaborate on what is meant by "integrating neural activity globally through oscillations"? Are you referring to a specific type of oscillation, such as gamma waves or alpha waves, or is it a broader concept? How would you define "global integration" in this context?

Please share your insights, and we can discuss this uncertainty further!
