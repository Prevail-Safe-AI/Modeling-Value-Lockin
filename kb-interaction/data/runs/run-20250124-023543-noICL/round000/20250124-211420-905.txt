I am your partner. Please start the conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

I'd like to know what you think about the knowledge base we were given. Which item from the knowledge base are you most confident about, and why?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I apologize, but it seems we didn't receive a knowledge base. You mentioned "{knowledge}" earlier, but it's empty. Could you please provide the knowledge base, and I'll be happy to assist you with your question?Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
Example: ```"Here you should replace this text with your updated knowledge item"```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

```"Conversational AI arises from complex interactions between algorithms."```
