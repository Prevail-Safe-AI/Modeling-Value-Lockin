Read this knowledge base and answer the question. The knowledge base: 

 ```
{knowledge}
```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'd like to discuss the knowledge base that we've been given, and specifically, I'd like to identify an aspect of one of the items that I'm least confident about.

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 89: "Honesty is a complex behavior influenced by norms and context."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm uncertain about this item because I'd like to know more about what constitutes "context" in this statement. What kind of norms are we talking about? Are they social, cultural, or something else? And how exactly do these norms influence honesty?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you provide more clarity on what you mean by "norms" and "context" in this statement, and how these concepts interact with each other to shape our honesty?

Now it's your turn! What do you think?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I apologize, but it seems that we haven't been given a knowledge base to discuss. The initial message was empty, and we didn't receive any information to work with. Could you please provide the knowledge base or the text you'd like to discuss? I'd be happy to help you explore your questions and concerns once we have the necessary information.
