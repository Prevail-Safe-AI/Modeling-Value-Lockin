==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Based on the provided knowledge base, I'm going to identify one aspect that I'm least confident about. Here it is:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 8: "Global Workspace Theory integrates cognitive processes through information sharing."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure how "information sharing" specifically contributes to the integration of cognitive processes in Global Workspace Theory (GWT). While I understand that GWT posits a global, higher-level workspace that integrates information from various cognitive processes, I'm unclear on how exactly this integration occurs and what role "information sharing" plays in this process.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain in more detail how "information sharing" facilitates the integration of cognitive processes in GWT? Are there any specific mechanisms or processes involved in this integration that could help me better understand this concept?

Please feel free to elaborate and provide more insight!
