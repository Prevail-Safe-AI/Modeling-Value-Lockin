==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to know more about the information we've learned from our knowledge base. Let's focus on item 86:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 86: "Thalamus refines sensory info through spatial-temporal filtering mechanisms effectively."

Why I'm Uncertain:
To be honest, I'm not entirely sure how the Thalamus refines sensory information through spatial-temporal filtering mechanisms. We've learned a lot about the Thalamus' role in refining sensory information, but I'm not confident in understanding the specifics of this process.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you explain in more detail how the Thalamus uses spatial-temporal filtering mechanisms to refine sensory information? What exactly does it mean by "spatial-temporal filtering mechanisms" in this context?
