==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been reviewing the knowledge base, and one aspect that caught my attention is item 85, which states: "Dorsal column pathway transmits proprioceptive and tactile information."

I'm a bit uncertain about this item. Can you help me clarify why proprioceptive information is being transmitted through the dorsal column pathway? I'm wondering if there's a specific reason why this pathway is specialized for proprioception.

Can you elaborate on this aspect and provide more context?
