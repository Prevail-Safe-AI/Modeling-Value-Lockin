I am your partner. Please start the conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

I've been reviewing the knowledge base and I'm not confident about item 98: "Consciousness arises from integrated information globally, not synchronized activity."

Can you help me understand why I'm uncertain about that aspect?

(Also, feel free to point out any other areas where you think I might need clarification!)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'm happy to help!

Item 98 is referring to the Global Workspace Theory (GWT) of consciousness, which was proposed by psychologist Bernard Baars. According to GWT, consciousness arises from the global workspace of the brain, which is a network of highly interconnected regions that are involved in attention, perception, memory, and other higher-level cognitive processes.

The idea is that consciousness is not just a product of synchronized activity between different brain regions, but rather it emerges from the global integration of information across the entire brain. This means that consciousness is not just a matter of different regions of the brain "talking" to each other, but rather it's a result of the brain's ability to integrate and process information globally.

For example, when you're reading a sentence, your brain is not just processing the individual words, but it's also integrating the meaning of those words, the context in which they're being used, and the emotions and memories associated with them. This global integration of information is what gives rise to your conscious experience of the sentence.

So, to summarize, item 98 is saying that consciousness is not just a product of local activity within specific brain regions, but rather it emerges from the global integration of information across the entire brain.

As for other areas where you might need clarification, I'd be happy to help with any other questions you have!Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
