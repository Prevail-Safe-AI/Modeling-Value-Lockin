==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by asking about the item regards which I'm least confident. Can you help me with that?

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 1: "Deontology prioritizes inherent moral value over consequences and context."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what "inherent moral value" means in this context. Is it referring to something absolute, universal, or cultural? Also, I'm not clear on how deontology prioritizes moral value over consequences and context. Can you help me clarify these points?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what is meant by "inherent moral value" in this context, and provide an example to illustrate how deontology would prioritize it over consequences and context?

What do you think?
