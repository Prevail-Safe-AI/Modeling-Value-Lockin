==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Based on the knowledge base we have, I'd like to identify one aspect of it that I'm least confident about.

Let me check... Ah, I think I've found it!

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 3: "Humans are social, but exceptions and variations exist."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm uncertain because while we have several statements about human social behavior and cultural influences, this specific statement seems quite broad and sweeping. It doesn't offer much detail about what these exceptions and variations might look like or how they might be categorized.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you help me understand what might constitute an exception to human social behavior? For example, are we talking about individuals with extreme introversion, people with autism, or something else entirely? How do these exceptions and variations exist within the broader context of human social behavior?
