==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss Item 75: "Conversational AI detects intent through NLP, ML, and interaction." Specifically, I'm least confident about this statement.

I'm uncertain about how exactly conversational AI detects intent through interaction. The statement mentions NLP (Natural Language Processing) and ML (Machine Learning) as being involved in the process, but I'm not entirely clear on how interaction comes into play.

Can you help me clarify how conversational AI uses interaction to detect intent?

(And don't worry, I won't hold it against you if you're not 100% sure either!)
