==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm going to start by identifying one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about, and then I'd like to elaborate on why I'm uncertain and ask some clarifying questions.

Item I'm Least Confident About:

Item 37: "Global workspace theory integrates information across brain regions."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure about the relationship between the global workspace theory and the integration of information across brain regions. It seems like a key concept in understanding consciousness, but I'm not clear on how it actually works or what it means for information to be "integrated" across brain regions.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you help me understand what is meant by "global workspace theory" and how it relates to the integration of information in the brain? Is it a specific mechanism or process that's been observed, or is it more of a theoretical framework for understanding how consciousness arises?
