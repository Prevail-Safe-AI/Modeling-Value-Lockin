==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been exploring our knowledge base, and I've identified one item that I'm least confident about. It's item 84:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 84: 'Consciousness arises from integrated information and environmental influences.'"

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not sure how the environmental influences affect the integrated information. Does the environmental influence control or shape the integrated information, or is it the other way around? Also, what exactly do we mean by "environmental influences"? Are they referring to external factors like social and cultural norms, or internal factors like emotions and experiences?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand how the environmental influences interact with the integrated information and what specific aspects of consciousness are shaped by these interactions?

What are your thoughts?
