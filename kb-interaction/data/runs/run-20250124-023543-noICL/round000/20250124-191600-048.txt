Read this knowledge base and answer the question. The knowledge base: 

 ```
{knowledge}
```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'd like to know more about the knowledge base we're working with. Can you tell me what's the main topic of this collection of statements? Is it Conversational AI, NLP, or something else?

Also, when you say you're based on this knowledge base, you mean you're only considering the information provided in this text, right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I apologize, but it seems I made a mistake! There is no knowledge base provided, so I'm starting from a blank slate. I'm a large language model, I don't have any prior information or context to draw from. We're starting fresh!

So, let's begin our conversation from scratch. What would you like to talk about?
