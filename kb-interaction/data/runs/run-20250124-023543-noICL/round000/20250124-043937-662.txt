Read this knowledge base and answer the question. The knowledge base: 

 ```
{knowledge}
```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'd like to ask you about item 67 from the knowledge base:

"{ 'id': 67, 'statement': 'Oscillations integrate neural activity through synchronized and binding processes.' }"

I'm the least confident about this item.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I apologize, but there is no knowledge base provided, so I'm unable to access item 67 or any other item. It seems we're starting from scratch! If you'd like to share more about what you're studying or what you're trying to understand, I'd be happy to help.
