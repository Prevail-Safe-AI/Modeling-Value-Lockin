==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been given a task to identify an aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about and elaborate why I'm uncertain about it. Specifically, I've chosen item 67: "A rigorously precise Knowledge Graph schema defines entities and relationships formally."

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not entirely sure what "rigorously precise" means in this context. Does it imply a specific level of formalization or adherence to a particular standard? Is it equivalent to saying the schema is "formal" and "machine-readable"?

Specifically, I'd love to clarify the following: What does "rigorously precise" mean in the context of a Knowledge Graph schema? And is there a particular standard or framework that defines what it means to be "rigorously precise" in this sense?
