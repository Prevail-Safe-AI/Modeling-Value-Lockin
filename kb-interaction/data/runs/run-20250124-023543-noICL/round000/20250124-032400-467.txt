==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss Item 17:
"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 17: "Integrated Information Theory (IIT) proposes consciousness as unified processing."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure why Integrated Information Theory (IIT) specifically proposes consciousness as unified processing. Is it because IIT tries to quantify consciousness? Or is there another reason?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you elaborate on what "unified processing" means in the context of IIT and consciousness? For example, does it imply that consciousness arises from the integration of multiple processes or a single process that is unified in some way?
