==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to explore the knowledge base together. Let's take it one item at a time. I've chosen an item that I'm least confident about, which is:

Item 18: "Consciousness arises from integrated information quantified by phi calculation in IIT."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure how "phi calculation" in Integrated Information Theory (IIT) specifically quantifies consciousness. I'd like to understand the relationship between consciousness and phi calculation more deeply.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand how phi calculation measures integrated information and how this relates to consciousness, according to IIT? How does this calculation provide insight into the nature of consciousness?

Your thoughts?
