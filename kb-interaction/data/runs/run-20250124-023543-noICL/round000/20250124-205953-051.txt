==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been reviewing our knowledge base, and I've identified one aspect that I'm least confident about. It's the statement:

"A data model defines the structure and relationships in Knowledge Graphs."

Item [1]: "A data model defines the structure and relationships in Knowledge Graphs."

Why am I uncertain about this aspect is because I'm not entirely sure what the term "data model" refers to in this context. Is it the same as a schema or an ontology? And what exactly does it mean for a data model to define the structure and relationships in a Knowledge Graph?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what you mean by "data model" in this context? How does it differ from a schema or ontology, and what are some key characteristics of a data model that define the structure and relationships in a Knowledge Graph?
