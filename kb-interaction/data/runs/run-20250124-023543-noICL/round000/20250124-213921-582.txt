==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying one aspect from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. Let me check...

Okay, I found it! The item I'm least confident about is:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 60: 'A Knowledge Graph schema defines entities, relationships, and properties formally precisely.'"

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm unsure about the phrase "formally precisely". I understand what "formally" means, but "precisely" makes me wonder if it's referring to the accuracy or exactness of the definitions. Are the entities, relationships, and properties defined with a specific level of granularity or detail? Or is it more about the process of defining them being rigorous and methodical?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what "formally precisely" means in this context? Does it imply a certain level of accuracy, detail, or rigor in defining the entities, relationships, and properties in a Knowledge Graph schema?
