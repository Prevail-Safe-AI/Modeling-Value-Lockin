==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm going to ask you about one item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. It's Item 60:

{
"id": 60,
"statement": "Deontology considers context and consequences relative to moral principles"
}

I'm feeling uncertain about this aspect because I'm not entirely sure what deontology is and how it relates to moral principles. I know deontology is a branch of ethics, but I'm unclear about how it considers context and consequences relative to moral principles.

Can you help me understand this concept better?

Specifically, I have some clarifying questions:

* What does deontology mean in the context of ethics?
* How does it consider context and consequences relative to moral principles?
* Are there any examples of how deontology is applied in real-life situations?

Can you help me clarify my understanding?
