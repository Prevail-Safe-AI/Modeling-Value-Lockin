==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss Item 15 from the knowledge base, which states: "Consciousness arises from integrated information processing globally."

I have to admit that I'm not confident about this aspect. I'm unsure what exactly is meant by "integrated information processing globally" or how it relates to consciousness.

Could you elaborate on that for me? What does it mean by "global integration" of information? Is it referring to the brain as a whole, or something more specific? And how does this integrated information processing lead to consciousness?

I'd love to know more about this concept and perhaps some examples or analogies that could help solidify my understanding.
