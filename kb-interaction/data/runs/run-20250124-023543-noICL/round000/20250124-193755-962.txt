==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been reviewing the knowledge base, and I've identified one aspect that I'm not entirely confident about. It's item 61:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 61: "Conversational AI uses Knowledge Graphs for entity recognition."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not sure how Knowledge Graphs (KGs) exactly facilitate entity recognition in Conversational AI. Is it through some specific algorithm or technique? Are there other ways to recognize entities in Conversational AI that are not mentioned in the knowledge base?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain how KGs specifically enable entity recognition in Conversational AI, and what are some other methods used for entity recognition in this field?"
