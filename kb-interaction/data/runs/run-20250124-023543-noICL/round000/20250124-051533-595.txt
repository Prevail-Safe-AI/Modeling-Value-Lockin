==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been reviewing the knowledge base, and I noticed that we have 99 statements about consciousness, honesty, and trust. One item that caught my attention is:

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 49: "Consciousness arises from global workspace integrating neural activity globally"

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what "global workspace" refers to in this context. Is it a specific brain region or a process that occurs across different brain regions? Additionally, I'm unclear on the exact mechanism by which neural activity is integrated globally to give rise to consciousness.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what the authors mean by "global workspace" and how it relates to the integration of neural activity in this statement?
