==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to know about item 89 from the knowledge base:

"Iten I'm Least Confident About:
Item 89: "Consistency in Knowledge Graph schema ensures data quality and ease"

Why I'm Uncertain:
It seems too vague to me, I'm not sure what kind of data quality and ease we're talking about, and how consistency in the schema relates to it.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain why consistency in a Knowledge Graph schema is crucial for data quality and ease, and what specific aspects of data quality and ease are we talking about?"

Please feel free to elaborate!
