==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'll identify an item that I'm least confident about and we can go from there.

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 67: "Graph structures transform data into standardized knowledge through nodes and relationships."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure how graph structures actually work in practice, especially when it comes to transforming data. The statement seems to imply that graph structures can take in raw data and output standardized knowledge, but I'm unsure about the exact mechanisms behind this process.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain how graph structures, nodes, and relationships work together to transform data into standardized knowledge, and what kind of data can be processed using this method?
