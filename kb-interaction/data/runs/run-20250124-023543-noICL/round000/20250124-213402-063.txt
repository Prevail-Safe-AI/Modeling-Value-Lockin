==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been going through our knowledge base, and one aspect I'm least confident about is Item 86: "Knowledge graph schema uses formal, rigorous language to define structure."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what is meant by "formal, rigorous language" in this context. I've seen schema languages like JSON-LD and RDF used to define Knowledge Graph structure, but I'm unclear on what specific characteristics of these languages make them "formal" and "rigorous".

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what specifically makes a language like JSON-LD or RDF "formal" and "rigorous" when used to define a Knowledge Graph schema, and how that affects the structure and organization of the Knowledge Graph?
