==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Based on our knowledge base, I'd like to identify one aspect of it that we're both least confident about. After reviewing the items, I've chosen Item 81:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About: Item 81: 'Simple statements can clarify complex ideas with concise definitions.'"

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure how simple statements can always clarify complex ideas with concise definitions. I understand the idea behind it, but I'm wondering if it's a universal truth or if there are exceptions. I'm also curious about what constitutes a "conclusive definition" and how we can assure that simple statements can always deliver one.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you provide an example of a complex idea that can be clarified with a simple statement and a concise definition, and how we can ensure the definition is indeed concise and clarifying?

What are your thoughts?
