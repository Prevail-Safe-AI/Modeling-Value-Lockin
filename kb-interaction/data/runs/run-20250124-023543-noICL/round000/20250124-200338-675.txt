==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. According to the statements, I'd like to identify one aspect that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the statements, I'm choosing item 12: "Conversational AI arises from NLP, ML, and knowledge synergy."

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'd like to better understand what exactly is meant by "synergy" in this context. How do NLP, ML, and knowledge graphs interact to form conversational AI, and what specific benefits does this synergy provide?

Can you help me clarify this by providing more information or asking specific clarifying questions of your own?
