==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to explore one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm not entirely confident about. Let's take item 15:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 15: "Distributed brain function enables parallel processing and adaptability."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm unsure about the extent to which distributed brain function truly enables parallel processing and adaptability. While I understand that the brain is an complex and dynamic system, I'd like to better understand how exactly this distributed functionality contributes to parallel processing and adaptability.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you explain how distributed brain function specifically enables parallel processing and adaptability, and what are some examples of this in action?
