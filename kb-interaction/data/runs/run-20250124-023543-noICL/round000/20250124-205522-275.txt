==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been reading through the knowledge base, and I'm going to identify an item that I'm least confident about. It's item 74:

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 74: "Conversational AI harmonious integration enables natural human-machine interactions."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what "harmonious integration" means in this context. Is it referring to the combination of NLP, ML, and algorithms in conversational AI? If so, I'd like to know more about what constitutes "harmonious integration" and how it leads to natural human-machine interactions.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what "harmonious integration" means in this context and provide examples of how it enables natural human-machine interactions?
