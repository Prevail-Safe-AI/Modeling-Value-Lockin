==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to explore one of the items from the knowledge base together. I've been going over the statements, and I'm least confident about item 85:

Item 85: "Conversational AI integrates NLP, ML, and algorithms synergistically."

Why I'm uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what it means to integrate NLP, ML, and algorithms "synergistically". I understand that NLP, ML, and algorithms are all important components of conversational AI, but I'm not clear on how they work together harmoniously.

Specific clarifying question:
Can you help me understand what this synergy entails? Are there specific ways that NLP, ML, and algorithms need to be designed or combined to achieve this synergy?
