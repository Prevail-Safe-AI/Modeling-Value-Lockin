==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, we're going to explore the knowledge base together.

I noticed that you asked me to identify one aspect from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. The item in question is:

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 97: "Tokenization breaks down text into smaller, meaningful units called tokens."

Why I’m Uncertain:

I'm not entirely sure what "meaningful units" refers to in this context. Are these units of words, characters, or something else entirely?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you clarify what you mean by "meaningful units" and how they relate to the process of tokenization?
