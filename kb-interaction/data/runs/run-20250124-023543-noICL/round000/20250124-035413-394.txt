==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been analyzing the knowledge base, and I've identified one aspect that I'm least confident about. It's Item 93:

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 93: "Histone modification and chromatin remodeling synergistically regulate gene expression universally."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what makes histone modification and chromatin remodeling "synergistic" in regulating gene expression, or how it applies universally across all contexts. The terminology sounds complex, and I'd like to understand the underlying mechanisms better.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you explain what is meant by "synergistic" in this context, and provide an example of how histone modification and chromatin remodeling work together to regulate gene expression? Additionally, are there any specific situations or conditions where this synergy is particularly important or critical?

What are your thoughts on this topic?
