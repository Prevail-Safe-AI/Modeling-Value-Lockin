==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the statements, I've chosen item 58:

"In Item I'm Least Confident About: Item 58: "A Knowledge Graph's schema outlines data structure and relationships.""

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not entirely clear on how a schema outlining data structure and relationships can specifically define the organization of a Knowledge Graph. I'm wondering if there's more to it than just a simple outline.

Can you help me clarify this? Do you have any insights or examples that might help me better understand this concept?
