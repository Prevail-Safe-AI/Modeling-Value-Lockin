==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Based on the knowledge base, I'm going to identify one aspect that I'm least confident about:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item [87]: "Thalamus actively processes and refines sensory information before transmission."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not sure about the specific processing and refining mechanisms involved in the role of the thalamus in sensory information processing. The statement seems to imply that the thalamus plays a crucial role in processing sensory information, but I'd like more clarity on how it does so.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain in more detail what "actively processes and refines sensory information" means in the context of the thalamus's role in sensory processing? For example, what specific mechanisms or pathways are involved, and how does the thalamus interact with other brain regions to achieve this processing and refining?
