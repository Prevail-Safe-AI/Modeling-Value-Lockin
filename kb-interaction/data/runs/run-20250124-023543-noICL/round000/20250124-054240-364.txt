==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I have been given a knowledge base that contains statements about various topics, including cultural norms, honesty, and consciousness. I would like to know more about one aspect of this knowledge base that I'm least confident about, which is:

Item 57: "Consciousness arises from integrated information globally through IIT."

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not clear on what IIT stands for or what it means to say that consciousness arises from integrated information globally. I would like to better understand this concept and how it relates to our understanding of consciousness.

Can you help me clarify this concept? Specifically, I would like to ask:

* What is IIT? Is it a theory or a framework?
* What do you mean by "integrated information globally"? How does this relate to consciousness?
