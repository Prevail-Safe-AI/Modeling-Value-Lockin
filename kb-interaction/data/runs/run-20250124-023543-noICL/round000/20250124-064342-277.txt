==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to explore my knowledge base and discuss an item that I'm not entirely confident about. Let's see... Ah, here it is!

Iten I'm Least Confident About:
Item 62: "Social learning shapes behavior through internalization, reinforcement, and socialization processes."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure how these three processes - internalization, reinforcement, and socialization - work together to shape behavior in the context of social learning. I feel like I understand each process individually, but I'm not confident in how they interact with each other to influence behavior.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand how these three processes - internalization, reinforcement, and socialization - interact with each other in social learning? For example, do they occur simultaneously, or do they build upon each other?

What are your thoughts on this?
