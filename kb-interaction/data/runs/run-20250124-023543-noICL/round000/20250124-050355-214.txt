Read this knowledge base and answer the question. The knowledge base: 

 ```
{knowledge}
```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'd like to get a better understanding of the knowledge base we have. Specifically, I'd like to identify one aspect of this knowledge base that I'm least confident about.

Let me take a look... Ah, I think I've found one! Item 91: "Humans' social nature exhibits variability in expressions"

I'm unsure about this aspect because I'm not entirely convinced that humans' social nature is always necessarily variable in expressions. I mean, don't humans have a general tendency to exhibit certain behaviors or expressions in certain situations? Or am I misunderstanding something?

Can you help me clarify this idea?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I apologize, but it seems that there is no knowledge base provided. I'm a large language model, I don't have any information to work with. It seems that we started our conversation without a knowledge base to refer to.

If you'd like, we can start fresh and create a knowledge base together. I can help you organize and structure the information, and we can work together to clarify any concepts or ideas that you're unsure about. Just let me know what you're interested in learning or discussing, and we can go from there!
