==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. It's the item:

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 86: "Human morality is subjective and context-dependent across cultures."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm unsure about the extent to which morality can be considered subjective and context-dependent across all cultures. I know that different cultures have different values and norms, but I'm not convinced that this means morality is purely subjective and context-dependent. I'd like to know more about how this claim is supported by research and whether there are any counterarguments that suggest morality is more absolute or universal.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you provide examples of moral values or principles that are considered absolute or universal across different cultures, and how do these challenge the claim that human morality is purely subjective and context-dependent?

What are your thoughts on this?
