==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Based on our knowledge base, I'd like to identify one aspect of the statement "Brain function is complex, involving distributed processing and neural plasticity." (Item 37) that I'm least confident about. 

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 37: "Brain function is complex, involving distributed processing and neural plasticity."

Why I'm Uncertain: I'm not entirely sure what distributed processing means in the context of brain function. I understand that the brain is complex and consists of many interconnected regions, but I'm unclear about how the processing of information is distributed across these regions. Is it a specific way of subdividing tasks or a concept related to neural networks?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you provide an example of distributed processing in brain function, such as a specific cognitive task that involves multiple brain regions working together in a distributed manner?
