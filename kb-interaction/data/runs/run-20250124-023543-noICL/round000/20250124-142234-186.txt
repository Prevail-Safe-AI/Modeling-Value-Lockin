==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been given a knowledge base with 99 items, and I've been asked to identify one item I'm least confident about. The item is:

Item 74: "Thalamus plays key role in filtering and selecting sensory information attention."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure about the specific role of the thalamus in filtering and selecting sensory information attention. I'm familiar with the general concept of the thalamus being a relay station for sensory information, but I'm not confident in my understanding of its precise role.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you help me understand more about the thalamus's role in attention? What does "filtering and selecting sensory information attention" mean in this context? How does the thalamus accomplish this filtering and selection process?

Your turn!
