==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 79 from the knowledge base:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 79: "Conversational AI uses Knowledge Graphs for entity recognition, relation mapping, and attribute extraction."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what role Knowledge Graphs play in conversational AI, and how they specifically contribute to entity recognition, relation mapping, and attribute extraction.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain how conversational AI uses Knowledge Graphs to recognize entities, map relationships between them, and extract attributes, and how this contributes to a more effective conversational experience?"

What are your thoughts?
