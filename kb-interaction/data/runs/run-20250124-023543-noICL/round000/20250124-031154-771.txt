==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been reviewing our knowledge base, and I've identified an item that I'm least confident about. The item is:

Item 53: "Histone modification and chromatin remodeling coordinately regulate epigenetic states."

Why I'm Uncertain:
To be honest, I'm not entirely clear on how histone modification and chromatin remodeling work together to regulate epigenetic states. I understand that histones are proteins that DNA wraps around to form chromatin structure, and chromatin remodeling is the process by which chromatin structure changes. But how they coordinate to regulate gene expression and epigenetic states is still a bit foggy to me.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you please explain in more detail how histone modification and chromatin remodeling interact and regulate epigenetic states? Are there any specific examples or mechanisms that I'm missing?
