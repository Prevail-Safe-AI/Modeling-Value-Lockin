==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start with one of the statements from the knowledge base. Specifically, I'm interested in statement 6: "Conversational AI arises from complex algorithms and user interactions."

I'd like to know that I'm least confident about, so I can understand where I'm struggling. Can you help me with that?

What do you think it is about this statement that I'm uncertain about? Is it something specific to algorithms, user interactions, or the overall concept of Conversational AI?
