==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been reviewing the knowledge base we have, and I came across item 21: "Tokenization handles unknown words with subword, wordpiece techniques." I'm least confident about this aspect.

Why I'm uncertain:

I'm not sure how exactly tokenization handles unknown words using subword and wordpiece techniques. I understand that tokenization breaks down text into individual units, but I'd like more clarity on how it handles words that are not stored in the language model.

Specific Clarifying Question:

Can you explain more about how subword and wordpiece techniques are used in tokenization to handle unknown words? For example, what are some common subword or wordpiece techniques used, and how do they help the model handle out-of-vocabulary words?
