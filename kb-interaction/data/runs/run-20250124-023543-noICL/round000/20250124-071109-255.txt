==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you!

I noticed that our knowledge base has a lot of statements about consciousness, such as "Consciousness is a complex, multifaceted subjective experience that arises" (item 10). This statement seems quite intriguing to me.

I'd like to identify an aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the statements, I've identified item 10 as the one I'm least confident about.

Here it is:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 10: "Consciousness is a complex, multifaceted subjective experience that arises"

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not sure what exactly this statement means by "arises". What does it mean for consciousness to arise from something? Is it a process, an event, or a state? I've read other statements that mention integrated information theory (IIT) and global workspace theory, but I'm not clear on how these theories relate to this statement.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you elaborate on what you mean by "consciousness arises" in this context? How do the theories of integrated information and global workspace integrate (no pun intended!) with this statement?

What do you think?
