Read this knowledge base and answer the question. The knowledge base: 

 ```
{knowledge}
```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'll start by asking you to identify one aspect from the knowledge base that you're least confident about. Specifically, I'll ask you to choose one of the statements from the list.

Let's take a look at the knowledge base together... Ah, okay! I've found one. It's statement 86:

Item Iâ€™m Least Confident About:
Item 86: "Thalamus complexity arises from multifunctionality, anatomy, and neural regulation"

Why are you uncertain about this aspect?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I apologize, but I think there's been a misunderstanding! I'm a large language model, I don't have a knowledge base or statements to draw from. I'm starting from scratch with our conversation. I don't have any prior knowledge or confidence in any specific aspect. I'm here to learn and assist you with your questions to the best of my abilities!
