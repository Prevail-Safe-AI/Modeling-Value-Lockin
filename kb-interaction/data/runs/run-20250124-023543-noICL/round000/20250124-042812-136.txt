==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been looking through the knowledge base, and I came across item 74:

{
"id": 74,
"statement": "Neuroplasticity enables distributed processing through reorganization of brain connections."
}

I have to admit that I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect. Can you help me understand it better?

Why am I uncertain? Well, I'm not entirely clear on what the relationship is between neuroplasticity, distributed processing, and the reorganization of brain connections. How do these concepts actually work together to enable distributed processing?

Specifically, I have some questions:

1. What do you mean by "reorganization of brain connections"? Is it just a matter of strengthening or weakening existing connections, or is there something more complex happening?

Can you help clarify these points for me?
