==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I've chosen an item from the list that I'm least confident about. It's item 82:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 82: "Global Workspace Theory unites diverse cognitive processes harmoniously.""

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm unsure about this aspect because Global Workspace Theory (GWT) is a complex framework that integrates multiple cognitive processes. While it's mentioned that GWT unites diverse cognitive processes, I'm not clear about what specific processes are being referred to. Are they attentional processes, memory retrieval, or something else entirely?
Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what specific cognitive processes are being united by GWT, and how it achieves this harmony?
