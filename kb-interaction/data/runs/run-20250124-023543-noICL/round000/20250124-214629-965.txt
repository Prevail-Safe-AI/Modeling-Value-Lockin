==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I've taken a look at the statements, and I'm going to choose one that I'm least confident about:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 88: "A schema defines Knowledge Graph structure and relationships formally precisely."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not sure what exactly is meant by "formally precisely". Is it referring to the formal language used to define the schema, or is it about the precision in which the schema defines the structure and relationships of the Knowledge Graph? I'm also unsure what the implications are of having a schema that defines things "formally precisely".

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you please help me understand what is meant by "formally precisely" in the context of Item 88? How does this concept differ from other ways to define a schema, and what are the benefits or consequences of having a schema that is defined in this way?

Please go ahead and respond!
