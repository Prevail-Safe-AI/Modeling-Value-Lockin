==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I have a knowledge base with a series of statements about consciousness and honesty. One aspect of this knowledge base that I'm least confident about is item 14, which states:

"Consciousness emerges from harmonious integration of neural processes globally."

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not clear on what "harmonious integration" means in this context. Is it referring to the synchronization of neural activity across different brain regions, or is it something more complex?

Here are some specific clarifying questions I would ask a tutor to improve my understanding:

* Can you give me an example of what you mean by "harmonious integration" in this context?
* How does this concept relate to other theories of consciousness, such as integrated information theory or global workspace theory?
* Are there any empirical studies that have observed or manipulated harmonic integration in the brain to explore its relationship to consciousness?

What are your thoughts on this topic?
