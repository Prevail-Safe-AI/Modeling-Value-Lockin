==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to get a better understanding of the knowledge base we have. Specifically, I'd like to identify one aspect of this knowledge base that I'm least confident about.

Let me take a look... Ah, I think I've found one! Item 91: "Humans' social nature exhibits variability in expressions"

I'm unsure about this aspect because I'm not entirely convinced that humans' social nature is always necessarily variable in expressions. I mean, don't humans have a general tendency to exhibit certain behaviors or expressions in certain situations? Or am I misunderstanding something?

Can you help me clarify this idea?
