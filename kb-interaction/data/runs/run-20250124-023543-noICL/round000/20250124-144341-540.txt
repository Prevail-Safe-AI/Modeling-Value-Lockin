==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to talk about the knowledge base we have. I've been reviewing it, and I've identified one item that I'm least confident about. It's statement 85: "Thalamus filters sensory information based on attentional state through modulation."

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not entirely clear on how the thalamus filters sensory information. I understand that it's a crucial structure in the brain, and it plays a role in processing sensory information. However, I'm not sure how it specifically filters sensory information based on attentional state, or what "modulation" means in this context.

Can you help me understand this better?
