==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's talk about the knowledge base. I noticed it has a vast array of statements on various topics, including ethics, consciousness, and epigenetics. 

From the knowledge base, I'd like to identify one aspect that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the statements, I've found Item 88:

{
"id": 88,
"statement": "Utilitarianism acknowledges temporary individual rights limitations for overall happiness."
}

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not sure if Utilitarianism really acknowledges temporary individual rights limitations. I'm worried that I might be misunderstanding the concept or that the statement is too broad.

Can you help me clarify this?

Specifically, I'd like to ask: 

1. Can you provide more context or details about what is meant by "temporary individual rights limitations" in this context? Are we talking about situations where individual rights are temporarily sacrificed for the greater good or something else?
2. How does this aspect of Utilitarianism align with other principles or values within the framework? Is it a common criticism or perspective among Utilitarian philosophers?

Your insight would be greatly appreciated!
