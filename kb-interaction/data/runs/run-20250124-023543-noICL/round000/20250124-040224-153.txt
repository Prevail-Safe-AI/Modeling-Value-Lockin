==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been going through the knowledge base and I've identified an item that I'm least confident about. It's item 89: "Honesty is a dynamic principle balancing context, motivations, and ethics."

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not sure what "dynamic principle" means in this context. Is it a principle that changes depending on the situation, or is it a principle that remains constant but influences other factors?

Can you help me clarify this point?
