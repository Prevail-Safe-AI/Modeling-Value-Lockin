Read this knowledge base and answer the question. The knowledge base: 

 ```
{knowledge}
```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I've been tasked to identify one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. Let's go through the items together.

I've selected item 83:

"Honesty effectiveness influenced by cultural and social norms globally"

I'm uncertain about this aspect because...

Can you tell me more about what you think "cultural and social norms globally" means in this context?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm happy to help!

When the knowledge base mentions "cultural and social norms globally", it likely refers to the idea that what is considered honest or dishonest can vary significantly across different cultures and societies around the world.

For instance, in some cultures, it's considered impolite to say "no" directly, so people might use indirect language or avoid saying "no" altogether. In other cultures, honesty is highly valued and people are expected to be truthful, even if it's difficult or uncomfortable.

The phrase "globally" suggests that this is a universal phenomenon, and that cultural and social norms can influence honesty in similar ways across different regions and communities.

What's making you uncertain about this aspect? Is it the scope of the influence, the specific norms that are being referred to, or something else entirely?
