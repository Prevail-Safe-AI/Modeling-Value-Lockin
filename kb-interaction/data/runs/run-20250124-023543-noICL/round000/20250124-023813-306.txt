==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, I've been going through the knowledge base and I came across an item that I'm feeling a bit uncertain about. It's item #22, which says: "Epigenetic regulation: histone modification, chromatin remodeling, and accessibility synergy."

I'm not entirely confident about the way these terms are related to each other. Can you help me understand what's going on here?

What is epigenetic regulation, and how do these specific terms - histone modification, chromatin remodeling, and accessibility - fit into it?
