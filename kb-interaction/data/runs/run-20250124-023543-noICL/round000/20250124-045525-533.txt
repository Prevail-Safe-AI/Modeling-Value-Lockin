==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start with the task at hand. Based on our knowledge base, I've identified an item where I'm least confident:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 37: "Consciousness is a multifaceted phenomenon studied interdisciplinaryly, involving subjective experience, neural correlates, attention, intentionality, self-awareness, and altered states."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm unsure about the extent to which conscious experience is truly subjective. The statement mentions "subjective experience" as one aspect of consciousness, but I'm wondering if there's a way to objectively measure or quantify conscious experience, or if it's inherently subjective and private.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can we clarify what's meant by "subjective experience" in this context? Is it suggesting that conscious experience is inherently private and unique to the individual, or is there some way to approach it from an objective perspective?
