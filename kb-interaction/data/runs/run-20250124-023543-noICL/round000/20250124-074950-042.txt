==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to ask about our knowledge base. I've been going through it, and I've found one item that I'm a bit uncertain about. It's this statement:

{
  "id": 62,
  "statement": "Neural oscillations integrate information across brain regions for consciousness."
}

I'm not entirely confident about this aspect of consciousness. I'd like to know more about it.

Why am I uncertain? Well, I'm not quite sure how neural oscillations actually integrate information across brain regions to achieve consciousness. I understand that neural oscillations are an important aspect of neural activity, but I'm not clear on the specific mechanisms involved in integrating information across different brain regions.

Can you help me clarify this point? Specifically, what do you think is meant by "integrate information"? Is it a matter of information being passed from one region to another, or is it something more complex?
