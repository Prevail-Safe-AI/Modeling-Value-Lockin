==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll share the task I have from the knowledge base. I'm supposed to identify one aspect of the item I'm least confident about and then elaborate why I'm uncertain about that aspect, and finally, formulate specific clarifying questions to ask a tutor to improve my understanding.

I chose item 36: "Consciousness arises from global workspace integrating neural activity globally."

I'm least confident about this item because I'm not entirely sure what it means by "global workspace". I've seen the term before, but I'm not clear on how it relates to consciousness and neural activity.

Can you help me elaborate on why I'm uncertain about this aspect, and then maybe provide some guidance on what clarifying questions I can ask a tutor?
