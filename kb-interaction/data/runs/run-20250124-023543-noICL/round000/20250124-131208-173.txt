==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to explore the knowledge base with you. I've chosen an item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about, and I'd like to discuss it with you.

Here's the item:

Item I'm Least Confident About:
Item 95: "Thalamus acts as relay station, filtering and transforming sensory information."

Why I'm Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure what role the thalamus plays in filtering and transforming sensory information. I understand that the thalamus is involved in sensory processing, but I'm not clear on how it specifically filters and transforms sensory information.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you elaborate on what the thalamus means by "filtering and transforming sensory information"? Is this process related to attentional modulation, or is it a separate function?
