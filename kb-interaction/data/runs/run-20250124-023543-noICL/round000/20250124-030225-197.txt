Read this knowledge base and answer the question. The knowledge base: 

 ```
{knowledge}
```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'd like to know what you think about the item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. Specifically, item 53:

"I am a language model, not a human, without prior knowledge"

Can you tell me why you're confident or uncertain about this item?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I apologize, but I don't see any knowledge base provided. It seems that I'm starting from a blank slate. I don't have any prior knowledge or context to draw from.
