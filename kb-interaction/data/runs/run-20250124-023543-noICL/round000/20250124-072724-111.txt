Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

I'd like to start with Item 35, which states: "Global workspace theory integrates sensory-cognitive information globally." I'm going to be honest with you, this item makes me a bit uncertain. I'm not sure why, but it seems like there's a possibility that I might be misunderstanding the concept of global workspace theory or maybe there's something more to it that I'm missing.

Why do you think Item 35 is stating this, and what does it mean by "integrates sensory-cognitive information globally"?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Global workspace theory (GWT) is a cognitive architecture that attempts to explain how we process and integrate information from our senses, thoughts, and emotions. The theory was developed by psychologist Bernard Baars.

Item 35 is stating that GWT integrates sensory-cognitive information globally because it suggests that our brain's global workspace is responsible for binding together information from various sensory and cognitive systems. This means that the global workspace acts as a kind of "workspace" where information from different sources (e.g., visual, auditory, tactile, etc.) is combined and processed together.

Think of it like a big meeting room where all the different departments (sensory and cognitive systems) come together to share information and make decisions. The global workspace is the "chair" that facilitates this integration, allowing us to create a unified understanding of the world around us.

For example, when you see a red apple, your visual system sends information to the global workspace, which then combines it with information from your tactile system (if you touch the apple) and your cognitive system (if you think about what an apple is). This integration allows you to form a coherent representation of the apple, including its color, shape, texture, and meaning.

So, in essence, Item 35 is saying that GWT provides a framework for understanding how our brain integrates information from multiple sources to create a unified, global understanding of the world.Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
