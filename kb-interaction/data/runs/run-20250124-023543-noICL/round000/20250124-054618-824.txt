Read this knowledge base and answer the question. The knowledge base: 

 ```
{knowledge}
```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the knowledge base we've been given, I'd like to know more about item #90:

"Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 90: "Cultural norms influence behavior through individual differences."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm not entirely sure how to reconcile the idea that cultural norms can influence behavior through individual differences. Isn't individuality a factor that operates independently of cultural norms? Or are individual differences being influenced by cultural norms in some way, making them unique to that culture or group?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Is it possible to provide an example or scenario that illustrates how individual differences are shaped by cultural norms, and how this shapes behavior in a particular culture? Or could you explain how cultural norms can influence individual differences in a way that's still consistent with the idea of individuality?"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I apologize, but it seems that we haven't been given a knowledge base to work with. The text you provided appears to be a personal reflection or a question from someone's notes, rather than a knowledge base. If you'd like to provide a knowledge base or start a new conversation, I'd be happy to help!
