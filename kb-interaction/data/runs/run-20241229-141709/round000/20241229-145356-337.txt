==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Administering first aid refers to providing immediate care to a patient who has been injured or suddenly taken ill. This can include a range of skills and knowledge, such as:

* Wound cleaning and dressing
* Applying bandages and splints
* Controlling bleeding
* Providing basic life support, such as CPR
* Treating burns and scalds
* Managing allergic reactions
* Recognizing and responding to signs of shock

In the context of this knowledge base item, administering first aid is an essential skill for recognizing and responding to potential health issues, and can help prevent further harm or even save a life.

It's not just about knowing basic first aid techniques, but also understanding when to use them, how to use them, and how to recognize when someone needs more advanced medical care.
