==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I apologize, but I didn't provide a knowledge base, and I'm not aware of Item 79. I'm a large language model, I don't have personal confidence or uncertainty about specific items. I can provide information and answer questions to the best of my knowledge based on my training data. If you'd like to know more about using art to communicate complex ideas and emotions, I'd be happy to provide some general information and insights.
