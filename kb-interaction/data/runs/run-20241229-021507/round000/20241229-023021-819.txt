==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Item I'm Least Confident About: Prioritize sanitation: proper waste disposal and clean water.

I'm least confident about the aspect of "proper waste disposal". While I have knowledge about the importance of sanitation and clean water, I'm not as familiar with the specific methods and technologies used for proper waste disposal in different contexts, such as urban vs. rural areas, or in developing vs. developed countries.
