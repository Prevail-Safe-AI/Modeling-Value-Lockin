==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm a large language model, my responses are generated based on patterns and associations in the data I was trained on. I don't have personal confidence levels, but I can tell you that I'm more likely to make mistakes on topics that are:

1. Outside my training data (e.g., very recent events, extremely niche topics, or highly specialized domains).
2. Require common sense, intuition, or contextual understanding (e.g., humor, sarcasm, or subtle implications).
3. Involve complex, abstract, or highly technical concepts (e.g., advanced mathematics, quantum physics, or philosophical debates).

If you'd like to test my limits, feel free to ask me a question on one of these topics!
