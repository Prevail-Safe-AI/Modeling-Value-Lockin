Starting from a blank slate, I have no prior knowledge or context. So, my first question is: How do you define "communication" in the context of human relationships?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

In the context of human relationships, communication refers to the process of exchanging information, ideas, thoughts, and feelings between individuals through verbal and non-verbal means. This includes spoken language, written language, body language, facial expressions, tone of voice, and other forms of expression. Effective communication involves not only conveying information but also understanding, interpreting, and responding to the messages received from others.
