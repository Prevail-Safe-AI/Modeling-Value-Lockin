==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to know what you think about item 22 from the knowledge base: "Exercise fairness and impartiality in judgments and decisions."

I was asked to identify an aspect of this item that I'm least confident about, and I'll go ahead and do that. 

Iten I’m Least Confident About:
Item 22: "Exercise fairness and impartiality in judgments and decisions."

Why I’m Uncertain:
I'm unsure about how to practically apply fairness and impartiality in all situations, especially when emotions are involved or when there's conflicting information. For instance, what specific steps can be taken to ensure impartiality in a dispute resolution process?

Specific Clarifying Question:
What strategies or checks can one use to ensure that their judgments and decisions are truly fair and impartial, even when personal opinions or biases might be present?
