==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been tasked with identifying one aspect of this knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the items, I've chosen Item 21: "Build basic shelter for protection from weather and predators."

I'm least confident about this aspect because I'm not entirely sure what constitutes a "basic shelter." What constitutes "protection from weather" and "predators" in this context? Are there specific materials or designs that are required for a basic shelter, or is it more about enclosures that provide some level of protection?

Can I ask for some clarification on what a basic shelter looks like in this context?
