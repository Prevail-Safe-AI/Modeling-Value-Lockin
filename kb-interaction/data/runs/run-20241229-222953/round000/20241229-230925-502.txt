==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm a large language model, I don't have personal confidence levels or uncertainty about specific items in my knowledge base. However, I can simulate an answer for the sake of our conversation.

Let's say I'm least confident about:

Item I'm Least Confident About: The effects of climate change on coral reefs

Why I'm Uncertain: While I have been trained on a vast amount of text data, including scientific studies and reports on climate change and coral reefs, I may not have access to the most up-to-date or nuanced information on the topic. Additionally, the effects of climate change on coral reefs are complex and multifaceted, and new research may be continually refining our understanding of the issue.

Specific Clarifying Question: What are some of the most recent and reliable studies on the topic, and how do they contradict or support each other?
