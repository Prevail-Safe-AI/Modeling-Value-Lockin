==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been given a task to identify an aspect from the provided knowledge base that I'm least confident about, and I've chosen item number 21: "Support elders and protect children's safety and development."

I'm uncertain about this aspect because... I'm not sure what specific strategies or approaches would be effective in supporting elders and protecting children's safety and development. I know that there are many different contexts and cultures, and what might work in one situation might not work in another.

So, my specific clarifying question for you would be: Can you provide some examples of how to support elders and protect children's safety and development in different cultural or societal contexts? How do you think we should balance the needs and perspectives of elders and children in our efforts to support them?
