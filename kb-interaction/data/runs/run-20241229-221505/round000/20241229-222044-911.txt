Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I've been given a knowledge base and I need to work with it. One item from the knowledge base is:

"Iten Iâ€™m Least Confident About:
Item 92: 'Engage in regular exercise and maintain physical fitness.'"

I'm not confident about this item. I'm uncertain about it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

What's making you uncertain about this item? Is it the type of exercise, the frequency, or something else entirely?
