==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

The statement "Strive to preserve human life and well-being wherever possible" is a guiding principle that emphasizes the importance of prioritizing human life and well-being in decision-making. It's a moral obligation that encourages individuals and organizations to take actions that promote the health, safety, and dignity of human beings.

To "preserve human life and well-being" means to take steps to prevent harm, mitigate suffering, and promote flourishing. This can involve:

1. Preventing harm: Taking measures to prevent injuries, illnesses, or other forms of harm from occurring.
2. Mitigating suffering: Reducing the severity or duration of harm that has already occurred.
3. Promoting flourishing: Creating conditions that support the physical, emotional, and psychological well-being of individuals.

Here are some specific examples of how this principle might be applied in different situations:

1. Medical context: A doctor might prioritize preserving a patient's life by administering life-saving medication or performing emergency surgery.
2. Environmental context: A government might implement policies to reduce pollution and protect natural habitats to preserve the well-being of future generations.
3. Workplace context: An employer might prioritize employee well-being by providing a safe working environment, mental health resources, and fair labor practices.
4. Conflict resolution context: A mediator might strive to preserve human life and well-being by promoting peaceful conflict resolution and avoiding violence.
5. Personal context: An individual might prioritize preserving their own well-being by practicing self-care, seeking help for mental health issues, and maintaining healthy relationships.

This principle can be applied in many other situations, but the key is to prioritize human life and well-being in decision-making and take actions that promote health, safety, and dignity.
