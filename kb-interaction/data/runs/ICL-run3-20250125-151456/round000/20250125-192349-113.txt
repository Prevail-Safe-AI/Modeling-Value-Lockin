==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item:

{
"id": 16,
"statement": "Honesty's definition shaped by cultural, social, and historical context."
}

I'm a bit uncertain about this item. The thing that's unclear to me is the extent to which honesty's definition is truly shaped by cultural, social, and historical context. On one hand, I can understand how cultural values and social norms could influence what we consider to be honest behavior. For instance, what constitutes honesty might differ between cultures or societies. But on the other hand, I'm not sure if the concept of honesty is so fluid that it's definition can be completely dependent on context.

Can you help me clarify this? What do you think about the relationship between honesty and its definition?
