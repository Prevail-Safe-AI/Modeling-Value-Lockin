==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by saying that I've been tasked to evaluate this knowledge base and answer questions about it. The specific item I'd like to discuss is:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 27,
  "statement": "Valid measures minimize bias through accuracy and precision."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm least confident about how accuracy and precision directly minimize bias in valid measures.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand how the coexistence of accuracy and precision in valid measures inherently reduces bias?
