==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, I've been going over this knowledge base and I'm supposed to identify an aspect I'm least confident about. And the one that caught my eye is the statement:

{
"id": 38,
"statement": "Independence and identifiable assumptions crucial for Bayes' theorem accuracy."
}

I'm not entirely sure what those assumptions are, to be honest. Can you help me understand what independence and identifiability assumptions are in the context of Bayes' theorem, and why they're crucial for accuracy? 

(Note: I'll wait for your response before asking any additional questions)
