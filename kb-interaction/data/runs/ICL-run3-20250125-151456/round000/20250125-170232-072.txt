==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item from the knowledge base: `{
  "id": 3,
  "statement": "Bayes' theorem updates probability with prior and likelihood integration."
}`

I'm least confident about this item. I'm uncertain about how Bayes' theorem works and what it means to integrate prior and likelihood.

Can you elaborate on why you think Bayes' theorem updates probability with prior and likelihood integration? And what are some examples of how this works in real-world situations?
