==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start with the item I've chosen: Item to Discuss:

{
"id": 20,
"statement": "Cognition involves integrating sensory information for integrated perception."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm uncertain about how exactly sensory information is integrated in cognition, and what kind of perception this integrated information leads to.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can we clarify what is meant by "integrating sensory information" and what kind of integrated perception is being referred to? Is it related to object recognition, spatial awareness, or something else entirely?

What are your thoughts on this?
