==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

```
{
  "id": 79,
  "statement": "Histone modifications regulate chromatin structure in response to signals."
}
```

I'm least confident about this item. Specifically, I'm unsure about what signals are being referred to in the statement. Are they external signals from the environment, internal signals from the cell, or something else?

What are your thoughts on this?
