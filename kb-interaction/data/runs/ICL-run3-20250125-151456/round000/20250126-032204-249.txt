==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 28, which states "Robust data collection protocols ensure transparency and accuracy."

Things I'm Uncertain About This Item:

I'm not entirely confident about the phrase "ensure transparency and accuracy". Can you help me understand what is meant by this phrase? For example, what kind of transparency and accuracy are we talking about in the context of data collection protocols?

Do you want to elaborate on what you think it means?
