==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, the item we're discussing is:

{
  "id": 90,
  "statement": "Consciousness arises from integrated neural activity across brain regions."
}

I'm a bit uncertain about this item. I'm unsure about how to interpret the phrase "integrated neural activity across brain regions." What does it mean, exactly? Is it referring to the activity of specific neurons, or a particular pattern of brain waves, or something else entirely?

Can you help me clarify what this statement is trying to say?

And, specifically, what kind of neural activity would this integrated activity consist of? Is it something that we can measure or observe directly?

Let me know if you can help me understand this better.
