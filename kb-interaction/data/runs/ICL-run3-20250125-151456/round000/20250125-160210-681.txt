==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by saying that I'm presenting an item from the knowledge base, which is:

Item to Discuss:
{
  "id": 91,
  "statement": "Neural oscillations modulate multisensory integration through frequency-specific filtering."
}

I'm least confident about the aspect of neural oscillations modulating multisensory integration. I'm not sure how neural oscillations work, and how they specifically filter multisensory information.

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
* How do neural oscillations modulate multisensory integration?
* What is frequency-specific filtering, and how does it relate to multisensory integration?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what neural oscillations are, and how they specifically modulate multisensory integration in the brain?

Please share your thoughts and insights!
