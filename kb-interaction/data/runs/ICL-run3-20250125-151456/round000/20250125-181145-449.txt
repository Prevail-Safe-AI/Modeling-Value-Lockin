==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 86 from the knowledge base:

{
"id": 86,
"statement": "ncRNAs regulate epigenetic inheritance through histone modification and DNA methylation."
}

I'm least confident about the specific mechanisms by which ncRNAs (non-coding RNAs) regulate epigenetic inheritance.

Things I'm Uncertain About This Item:

* I'm unclear about the exact molecular mechanisms by which ncRNAs interact with histone modification and DNA methylation to regulate epigenetic inheritance.
* I'm unsure about the specific types of ncRNAs that are involved in this regulation.

Specific Clarifying Question:

Can you explain the molecular mechanisms by which ncRNAs regulate epigenetic inheritance, and maybe provide some examples of specific types of ncRNAs that are involved in this process?

What are your thoughts on this item? Do you have any insights or clarifications you'd like to share?
