==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's discuss the item:

```
{
  "id": 85,
  "statement": "Histone modifications regulate chromatin structure and gene expression."
}
```

I'm least confident about this item because I'm not sure how histone modifications specifically regulate chromatin structure and gene expression. I'd like to understand the mechanisms involved.

Can you elaborate on how histone modifications affect chromatin structure and gene expression? And specifically, how do these modifications regulate gene expression?

Please help me clarify!
