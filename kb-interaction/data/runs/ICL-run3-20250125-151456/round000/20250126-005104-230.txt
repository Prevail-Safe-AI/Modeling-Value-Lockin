==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the statement "Objectivity emerges from iterative consideration of diverse perspectives." I'm least confident about this item.

Things I'm Uncertain About This Item:

* I'm not sure what's meant by "iterative consideration". Does it mean considering diverse perspectives multiple times, or is it more about considering different perspectives simultaneously?
* I'm also unsure about what's meant by "emerges from". Is it saying that objectivity is a direct result of considering diverse perspectives, or is it more about how considering diverse perspectives contributes to objectivity?

Specific Clarifying Questions:

* Can you explain what's meant by "iterative consideration" in this context?
* How does considering diverse perspectives actually contribute to objectivity, and what are some examples of this in action?

Your thoughts?
