==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been asked to identify one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. The item is: 

{
  "id": 39,
  "statement": "Honesty is a crucial, yet not sufficient condition"
}

After reviewing this item, I'm actually quite curious about what the phrase "yet not sufficient" means in this context. Can you help me understand what it is about honesty that makes it insufficient as a condition?
