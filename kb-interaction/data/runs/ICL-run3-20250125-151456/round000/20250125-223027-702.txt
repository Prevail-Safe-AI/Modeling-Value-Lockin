==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, I see that we have a statement here that says "Consciousness arises from global workspace's integrated information processing integration." I'm not an expert in this field, but this statement seems to be related to the concept of consciousness and how it arises from brain function.

I'm least confident about this aspect because I don't fully understand what the "global workspace" refers to or how it integrates information. Could you help me elaborate on what this term means?

Specifically, what is the global workspace, and how does it integrate information to give rise to consciousness?
