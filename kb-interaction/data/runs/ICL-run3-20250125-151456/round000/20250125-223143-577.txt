==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've chosen an item from the knowledge base that I'd like to discuss: 

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 98,
  "statement": "Prior distribution represents initial beliefs about model uncertainty."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm a bit unclear about how the prior distribution, which represents the initial probability distribution of the model parameters, is related to uncertainty in the model. 

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain why the prior distribution represents initial beliefs about model uncertainty? What does it mean by "initial beliefs", and how does this relate to the concept of uncertainty in the model?

What are your thoughts on this item?
