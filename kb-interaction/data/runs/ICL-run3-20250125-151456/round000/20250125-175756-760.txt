==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 98,
"statement": "Epigenetic marks regulate gene expression through chromatin structure modifications."
}

I'm a bit uncertain about this item, and I'd like to explore it further. Can you help me understand why epigenetic marks can regulate gene expression through chromatin structure modifications?

Specifically, I'd like to know more about what exactly is meant by "chromatin structure modifications" in this context. What kind of modifications are we talking about, and how do they specifically affect gene expression?
