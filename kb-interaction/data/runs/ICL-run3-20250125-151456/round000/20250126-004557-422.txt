==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item I'm going to discuss. Item 96 says that "Histone modifications alter chromatin structure through electrostatic interactions."

I'm quite unsure about this aspect. I'm not familiar with the concept of electrostatic interactions in chromatin structure, and I'm not confident that histone modifications do indeed alter chromatin structure through this mechanism.

Can you help me understand why you think this might be the case? What is the scientific basis for this claim?

Also, I have a few specific clarifying questions to improve my understanding:

* What exactly are electrostatic interactions, and how do they impact chromatin structure?
* How do histone modifications lead to electrostatic interactions that alter chromatin structure?
* Are there any specific experiments or studies that demonstrate this phenomenon?

Can you help me understand these aspects better?
