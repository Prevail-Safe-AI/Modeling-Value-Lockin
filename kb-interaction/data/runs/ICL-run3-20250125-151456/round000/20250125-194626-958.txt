==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you! I'd love to discuss the item: `{ "id": 77, "statement": "Prior and likelihood combine to update Bayes' theorem probability" }`

To be honest, I'm not entirely confident about how Bayes' theorem probability updates. I understand that prior probability and likelihood are essential components, but I'm not sure how they combine to produce the final result.

Can you elaborate on that process? How do these two elements, each with their own probability distribution, come together to give us the updated probability? What are the key steps involved?
