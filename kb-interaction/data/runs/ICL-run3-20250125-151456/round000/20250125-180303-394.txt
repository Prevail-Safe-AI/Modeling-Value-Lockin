==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item. I've been assigned to discuss Item 76:

{
"id": 76,
"statement": "Integrated Information Theory (IIT) measures consciousness mathematically"
}

I'm feeling least confident about this aspect. I'm uncertain about how IIT measures consciousness mathematically.

Can you help clarify why IIT measures consciousness in this way? How does it quantify consciousness?
