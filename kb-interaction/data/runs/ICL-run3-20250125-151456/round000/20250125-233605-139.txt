==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, I've seen this piece of knowledge base, and I'm interested in one aspect of it, specifically item 61:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 61,
"statement": "Epigenetic factors influence gene expression through chromatin structure binding."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not entirely sure how "chromatin structure binding" exactly plays a role in gene expression.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what is meant by "chromatin structure binding" and how epigenetic factors influence gene expression through this mechanism?
