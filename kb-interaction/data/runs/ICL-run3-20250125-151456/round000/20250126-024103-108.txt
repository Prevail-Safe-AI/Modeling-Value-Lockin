==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been asked to identify one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the item, I've identified it as the following:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 98,
"statement": "Emotional regulation enhances self-awareness by reducing mental distractions."
}

Things I'm Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not entirely sure how emotional regulation actually reduces mental distractions in the context of self-awareness. I can understand how emotional regulation can help reduce distractions in general, but I'm not sure how it specifically contributes to self-awareness.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you explain or provide examples of how emotional regulation reduces mental distractions and enhances self-awareness?
