==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by discussing item number 35 from the knowledge base:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 35,
"statement": "Research integrity balances honesty, transparency, and robust methodology harmoniously."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

I'm least confident about the statement's assumption that research integrity can be balanced harmoniously among honesty, transparency, and robust methodology.

Elaborate why you’re uncertain about that aspect:

Can you help me understand what you think is meant by "harmonious balance"? Do you think it's implying that these three aspects of research integrity are mutually exclusive or can be prioritized over one another?
