==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 71. The statement says "Systematic research documentation ensures transparency, accountability, and credibility." I'm least confident about this aspect because I'm not sure what exactly "systematic research documentation" entails.

Can you help me understand what kind of documentation this refers to? For example, is it referring to writing down every step of the research process, or is it more about keeping records of specific data and results?

Also, how does this documentation ensure transparency, accountability, and credibility? Is it because it provides a clear record of the research methods and findings, making it easier for others to verify the results?
