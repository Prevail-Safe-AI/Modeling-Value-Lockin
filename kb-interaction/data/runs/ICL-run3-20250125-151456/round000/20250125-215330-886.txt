==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm going to start with the item from the knowledge base. I've chosen item 13, which says: "The multifaceted nature of honesty shapes trust development complexities." 

I'm least confident about this item because I'm not entirely clear on what exactly "multifaceted nature of honesty" means. Can you help me understand this concept better?
