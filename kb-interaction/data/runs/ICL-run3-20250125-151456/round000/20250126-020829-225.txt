==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, the item we're discussing is:

{
"id": 3,
"statement": "Objectivity emerges from intentional bias recognition and active mitigation."
}

I'm unsure about this aspect: "Objectivity emerges from intentional bias recognition and active mitigation."

I'm uncertain about this because I'm wondering how exactly intentional bias recognition and active mitigation can guarantee objectivity. Can we really eliminate all biases? Are there any specific techniques or strategies that can help achieve this?

Can you help me clarify what this statement means and how it works?
