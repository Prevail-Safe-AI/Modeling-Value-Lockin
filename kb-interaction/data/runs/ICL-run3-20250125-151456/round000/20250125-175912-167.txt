==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been given a task to review a statement from the knowledge base, and I've chosen statement 70: "Consciousness arises from integrated brain information processing."

I'm a bit uncertain about this item. What are your thoughts on it? Do you think it's a well-supported statement, or are there some aspects that are harder to grasp?

I'm particularly curious about the concept of "integrated brain information processing." Can you help me understand what that means in more detail? Or, are there any related concepts that might be helpful in clarifying this statement?
