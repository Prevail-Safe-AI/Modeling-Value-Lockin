==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 76,
"statement": "Biases can persist despite awareness due to intricacies of human thought"
}

I'm least confident about this item because I'm not entirely sure what is meant by "intricacies of human thought" in the context of biases persisting despite awareness. Could you elaborate on what you think is meant by this phrase?

And are there any specific examples or scenarios where you think this statement might be true?
