==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start by identifying one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. The item is:

```
{
  "id": 82,
  "statement": "Epigenetic modifications alter chromatin structure to regulate gene expression."
}
```

I'm not confident about the relationship between epigenetic modifications and chromatin structure. I'd like to ask:

"Can you help me understand how epigenetic modifications specifically alter the chromatin structure to regulate gene expression? Is it a direct causal relationship or are there some intermediate mechanisms at play?"

What are your thoughts on this?
