==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 1,
"statement": "Bayes' theorem combines prior, likelihood, and evidence mathematically precisely."
}

I'm least confident about this item because I'm unsure about the phrase "mathematically precisely". I'd like to know more about what "precisely" means in this context.

Can you elaborate on why you think this is an accurate statement?
