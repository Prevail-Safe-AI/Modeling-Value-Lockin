==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm going to start by identifying one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 60,
  "statement": "Moral justification depends on careful consideration of consequences."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

I'm uncertain what exactly is meant by "careful consideration of consequences". What does this phrase imply? Is it just about thinking through the potential outcomes of a decision, or is there something more nuanced going on?

Specific Clarifying Question:

Could you help me understand what specifically is meant by "careful consideration of consequences"? Is there a particular philosophical or moral framework that underlies this idea?
