==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item. I'd like to discuss the item with the id 24:

{
"id": 24,
"statement": "Prior distribution reflects analyst's subjective uncertainty before data."
}

I'm least confident about this aspect. I'm unsure about how a prior distribution reflects an analyst's subjective uncertainty before data.

Can you elaborate on why you think this is true? What do you mean by "subjective uncertainty" in the context of prior distributions?

And then, I'd love to formulate some clarifying questions to improve our understanding.
