==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 45,
"statement": "Objectivity demands proactive bias recognition and mitigation efforts."
}

I'm a bit uncertain about this item. I'm not entirely sure what "proactive bias recognition and mitigation efforts" exactly entail. Can you help me clarify this aspect?

What do you think the phrase "proactive bias recognition" means in this context? Is it about actively searching for biases or recognizing biases that are already present?
