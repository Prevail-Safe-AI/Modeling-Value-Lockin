==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the statement on brain processing: "Hierarchical and parallel brain processing enables efficient sensory analysis."

One aspect I'm least confident about is the relationship between hierarchical and parallel processing in the brain. I'm wondering if you could elaborate on why you think these two processing methods enable efficient sensory analysis.

What is it about hierarchical and parallel processing that makes them work together to facilitate efficient sensory analysis?
