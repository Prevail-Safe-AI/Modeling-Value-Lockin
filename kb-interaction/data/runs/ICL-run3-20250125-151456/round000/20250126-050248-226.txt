==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 54,
  "statement": "Research environment and context influence cognitive biases indirectly."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm least confident about the statement itself, specifically the phrase "indirectly". I'm not entirely sure what is meant by "indirectly" in this context. Is the author implying that the research environment and context have a subtle or subtle impact on cognitive biases, separate from a direct influence?

Elaborate why you're uncertain about that aspect?

(And then we can formulate specific clarifying questions to ask a tutor to improve our understanding)
