==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into item 58. It states that "Clear language in scope statements is simple, concise, and accessible through". I'm not confident about this aspect because I'm not entirely sure what it means by "accessible through". Is it referring to the audience, the medium, or something else entirely? Can you help me clarify what this phrase is trying to convey?

Also, how does this aspect of clear language in scope statements contribute to the overall research integrity?
