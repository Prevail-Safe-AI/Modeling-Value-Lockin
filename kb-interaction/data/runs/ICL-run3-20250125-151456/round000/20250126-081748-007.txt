==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item. I've chosen one aspect that I'm least confident about, which is:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 44,
"statement": "Biases can occur independently of methodological limitations in research findings."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm unsure about how biases can occur independently of methodological limitations in research findings. It seems like biases are often a result of flawed methodology. I'd like to clarify how biases can exist outside of methodological issues.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain how biases can occur independently of methodological limitations in research findings? What are some examples of biases that might occur in a research study, even with a rigorous methodology?
