==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the statement "It is never morally acceptable to lie because honesty is the foundation of trust." (id: 0)

I'm not confident about the statement "Honesty is not the sole foundation of trust entirely." (id: 59)

Can you elaborate on why you think this statement might be true?
