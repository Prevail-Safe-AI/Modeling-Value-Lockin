==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss a specific item from the knowledge base. According to the item:

{
"id": 67,
"statement": "Objectivity emerges from harmonious balance of honesty and transparency."
}

I'm the least confident about this aspect. To be honest, I'm not entirely sure what is meant by "harmonious balance" in this context. It seems to imply that honesty and transparency are intertwined and that one can't exist without the other, but I'm not sure how to exactly achieve this balance or what it looks like in practical terms.

Can you help me understand what this item is trying to convey?
