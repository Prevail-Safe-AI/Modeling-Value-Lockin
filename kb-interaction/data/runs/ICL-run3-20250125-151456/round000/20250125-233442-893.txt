==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Here's the item I'd like to discuss:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 16,
  "statement": "Epigenetic modifications change chromatin structure to regulate gene expression."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm least confident about how epigenetic modifications exactly change chromatin structure to regulate gene expression. The statement seems to imply a direct causal relationship, but I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation.

Could you elaborate on what you think happens when epigenetic modifications change chromatin structure, and how that affects gene expression?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you explain what kind of chromatin structure changes are involved in regulating gene expression, and what specific mechanisms allow epigenetic modifications to influence those changes?
