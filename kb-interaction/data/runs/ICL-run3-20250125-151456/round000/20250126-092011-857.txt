Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 82,
"statement": "Biases result from complex interplay between internal and external factors."
}

Things I'm Uncertain About This Item:

I'm not sure why biases occur from the interplay between internal and external factors. How do internal factors like personal experiences and cultural background influence the emergence of biases, and how do external factors like societal pressures and research environment contribute to it?

Specific Clarifying Question:
What are some examples of internal and external factors that can lead to biases in research, and how do these factors interact to produce biased results?
