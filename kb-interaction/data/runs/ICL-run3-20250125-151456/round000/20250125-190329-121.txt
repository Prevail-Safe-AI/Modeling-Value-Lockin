==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by saying that I've been assigned to discuss the item "Epigenetic inheritance involves histone modifications and DNA methylation interactions synergistically." from the knowledge base.

I'm a bit uncertain about this item, specifically the part where it says "synergistically". I'm not entirely sure what that means in the context of epigenetic inheritance.

Could you help me understand what "synergistically" refers to in this statement?
