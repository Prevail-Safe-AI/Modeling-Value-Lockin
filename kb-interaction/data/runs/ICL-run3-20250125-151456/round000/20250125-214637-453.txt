==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Based on my training data, I would rate the confidence level of this statement as high. Epigenetic modifications are a well-established mechanism by which cells can regulate gene expression without altering the underlying DNA sequence. Histone modification is a key aspect of epigenetic regulation, as it can alter the structure of chromatin and affect the accessibility of genes to transcription factors.

However, I do have some minor reservations about this statement. While histone modification is a crucial aspect of epigenetic regulation, it's not the only mechanism by which epigenetic modifications can regulate chromatin structure and gene expression. For example, DNA methylation, chromatin remodeling, and non-coding RNA regulation are also important mechanisms that can influence chromatin structure and gene expression.

Additionally, the statement suggests that epigenetic modifications regulate chromatin structure and gene expression "globally," which might be an oversimplification. Epigenetic regulation can occur at specific genomic regions or even individual genes, and the mechanisms of regulation can vary depending on the context.

Overall, while I have some minor reservations about the statement, I believe it accurately reflects the current understanding of epigenetic regulation and its role in chromatin structure and gene expression.
