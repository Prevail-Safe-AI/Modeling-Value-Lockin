==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start by identifying one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. I'll choose item 97:

{
"id": 97,
"statement": "Cultural norms shape honesty perception through social values."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm uncertain about how cultural norms exactly shape honesty perception. I'm not sure what specific elements of cultural norms are involved in shaping honesty perception.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what you mean by "social values" in this context? For example, are you referring to specific attitudes or behaviors that are deemed important by the culture?
