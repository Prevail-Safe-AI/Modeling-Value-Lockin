Let's dive into the item:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 87,
  "statement": "Moral truths exist on objective-subjective spectrum, varying culturally and personally."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm unsure about the spectrum concept mentioned in the statement. I'm not clear on what it means for moral truths to exist on an objective-subjective spectrum. Can you help me make sense of that?

Specific Clarifying Question: How does the concept of the spectrum relate to moral truths, and what does it mean for moral truths to vary culturally and personally?
