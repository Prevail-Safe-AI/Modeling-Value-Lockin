==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'd like to examine this statement:

```
{
  "id": 8,
  "statement": "Researchers must consider internal and external factors in research integrity."
}
```

I'm least confident about what "internal and external factors" specifically refer to in the context of research integrity. Can you help me understand what these factors are?

What do you think about this statement?
