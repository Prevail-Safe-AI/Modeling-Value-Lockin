==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item from the knowledge base:

{
  "id": 5,
  "statement": "Prior distribution reflects analyst's subjective uncertainty before data."
}

I'm not very confident about this item. I'm uncertain about why the prior distribution would necessarily reflect the analyst's subjective uncertainty before data. Can you help me understand this better?

Can you explain why the prior distribution would be affected by the analyst's subjective uncertainty?
