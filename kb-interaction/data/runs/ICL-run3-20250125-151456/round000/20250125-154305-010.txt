==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into Item 53: "Rip currents form in coastlines with complex underwater topography". I'd like to know what you're least confident about regarding this statement.

Is it perhaps the definition of complex underwater topography, or the relationship between rip currents and coastlines, or something else entirely?
