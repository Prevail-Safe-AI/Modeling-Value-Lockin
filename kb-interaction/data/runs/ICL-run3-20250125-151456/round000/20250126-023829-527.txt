==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 77,
"statement": "Emotional regulation enhances self-awareness through increased cognitive flexibility."
}

I'm a bit uncertain about this item. What I'm unsure about is how emotional regulation specifically enhances self-awareness through increased cognitive flexibility.

Could you help me understand this better? What do you think is meant by "cognitive flexibility" in this context, and how does emotional regulation improve it? 

Also, I'd appreciate it if you could provide some examples or explain how this concept is applied in real-life situations.
