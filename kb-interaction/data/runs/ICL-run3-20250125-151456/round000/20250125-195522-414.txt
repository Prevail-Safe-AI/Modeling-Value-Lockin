Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's start with the item we're discussing, which is:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 93,
  "statement": "Consciousness arises from specific, localized brain regions, not globally."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm least confident about the statement made in this item. I'm not sure why, but I have a hard time accepting that consciousness arises only from specific, localized brain regions.

Can you elaborate on why you're uncertain about this aspect as well?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'm glad you brought this up! I'm also uncertain about this item, and I think it's because the statement seems to contradict some of the other knowledge we have about consciousness.

For example, some theories of consciousness, such as integrated information theory (IIT), suggest that consciousness arises from the integrated processing of information across the brain, rather than just specific localized regions. According to IIT, consciousness is a global property of the brain that emerges from the integrated information generated by the causal interactions within the brain.

Additionally, some research has shown that different brain regions are involved in different aspects of consciousness, such as attention, perception, and memory. This suggests that consciousness may not be localized to a single region, but rather is a distributed process that involves multiple brain regions.

So, while the statement may be true in some sense, it seems to oversimplify the complexity of consciousness and the brain's role in generating it. Do you have any thoughts on this?Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
Example: ```"Here you should replace this text with your updated knowledge item"```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
