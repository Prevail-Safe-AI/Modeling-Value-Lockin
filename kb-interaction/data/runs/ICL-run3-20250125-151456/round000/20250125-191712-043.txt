==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item we're discussing. Specifically, item 25 states: "Epigenetic inheritance involves histone modification, DNA methylation, and chromatin remodeling interactions."

I'm least confident about this aspect because, as a layperson, I don't fully understand the biological and molecular mechanisms behind epigenetic inheritance. I'm not sure how these specific processes (histone modification, DNA methylation, and chromatin remodeling interactions) contribute to the inheritance of epigenetic information.

Can you help me improve my understanding by elaborating on what's meant by these processes and how they work together to achieve epigenetic inheritance?
