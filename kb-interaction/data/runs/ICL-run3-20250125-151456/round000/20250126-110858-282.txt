==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start.

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 82,
  "statement": "Trust fosters honesty in social and institutional structures through cooperation."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm a bit unsure about how trust contributes to fostering honesty in social and institutional structures. It seems like a bit of a vague concept to me. Can you help me understand what this statement means and how trust and cooperation are supposed to work together to create an environment where honesty thrives?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you give an example of how trust and cooperation can lead to increased honesty in a real-world scenario? For instance, how does this work in academia, business, or government?
