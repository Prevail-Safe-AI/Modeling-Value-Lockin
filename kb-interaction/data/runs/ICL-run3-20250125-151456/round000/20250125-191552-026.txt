Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

I'd like to discuss the item:

```
{
  "id": 79,
  "statement": "Histone modifications regulate chromatin structure in response to signals."
}
```

I'm least confident about this item. Specifically, I'm unsure about what signals are being referred to in the statement. Are they external signals from the environment, internal signals from the cell, or something else?

What are your thoughts on this?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'm happy to help clarify!

The statement "Histone modifications regulate chromatin structure in response to signals" is referring to internal signals from the cell. In the context of epigenetics, histone modifications are a type of epigenetic mark that can be added or removed in response to various cellular signals.

These signals can come from various sources, such as:

1. Transcription factors: Proteins that bind to specific DNA sequences and regulate gene expression. When a transcription factor binds to a gene, it can trigger the addition or removal of histone modifications, leading to changes in chromatin structure and gene expression.
2. Signaling pathways: Intracellular signaling pathways that transmit signals from the cell surface to the nucleus. These pathways can regulate histone modifications and chromatin structure in response to extracellular cues, such as growth factors, hormones, or stress signals.
3. Chromatin remodeling complexes: Enzymes that can modify chromatin structure by adding or removing histone modifications, or by sliding or looping chromatin fibers. These complexes can be regulated by various signals, including transcription factors, signaling pathways, or other chromatin-modifying enzymes.

In summary, the "signals" referred to in the statement are internal signals from the cell that regulate histone modifications and chromatin structure. These signals can come from various sources, including transcription factors, signaling pathways, and chromatin remodeling complexes.

I hope this helps clarify things!Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
