==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into it.

I've identified the item I'm least confident about as the one you mentioned: `{ "id": 28, "statement": "Epigenetic modifications regulate gene expression through chromatin structure alterations" }`

I'm uncertain about how epigenetic modifications exactly affect chromatin structure and subsequently gene expression. I'd love to understand more about the mechanisms at play here.

Can you help me clarify this point?
