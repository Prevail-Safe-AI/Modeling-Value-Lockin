==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the item:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 76,
"statement": "Author credibility arises from both expertise and experience."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm least confident about the exact relationship between expertise and experience in contributing to author credibility. Are we saying that expertise is a necessary condition for author credibility, while experience is a sufficient condition? Or perhaps expertise and experience are both necessary and sufficient conditions?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can we define what we mean by "expertise" in this context? For instance, is it referring to formal education, research background, or specific skills? And what about "experience"? Is it referring to past research experience, teaching experience, or something else?
