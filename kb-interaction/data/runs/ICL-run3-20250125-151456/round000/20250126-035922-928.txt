==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's discuss item 13 from the knowledge base:

{
"id": 13,
"statement": "Research consistency requires balanced standardization and adaptability."
}

I'm not entirely confident about this aspect. Here's why:

I'm not sure what exactly "balanced standardization and adaptability" means in the context of research consistency. Are we talking about having a standardized methodology, but also being flexible to adjust it when necessary? Or is it something else?

Can you help me clarify what this statement is trying to convey?
