==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. It's item 79:

{
"id": 79,
"statement": "Lying can be morally justifiable in extreme circumstances."
}

I'm uncertain about this item because I've always been taught that honesty is the best policy and that lying is morally wrong. The idea that lying could be justified in extreme circumstances seems to contradict this. I'd like to understand more about what kind of extreme circumstances could make lying morally justifiable.

Can you help me understand this item better?
