==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 63,
  "statement": "Cultural norms influence honesty definitions in various contexts."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm unsure about the scope and complexity of cultural norms' influence on honesty definitions. Are there specific cultural norms that have a significant impact on honesty definitions, or is it a more nuanced and varying aspect across different cultural contexts?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what you mean by "various contexts" in the statement? Are we looking at different countries, regions, or specific communities within a society? Are there any examples or case studies that demonstrate the cultural norms' influence on honesty definitions in these contexts?
