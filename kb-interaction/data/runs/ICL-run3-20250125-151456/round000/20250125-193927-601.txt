==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item "Cultural values shape understanding of honesty's definition variably."

I'm interested in understanding this statement better. Specifically, I'm uncertain about what the statement means by "shape understanding of honesty's definition variably." Can you help me clarify this?

What does it mean for cultural values to shape the understanding of honesty's definition in a variable way? Is it saying that different cultural values lead to different definitions of honesty, or that cultural values influence how people perceive and understand honesty in different ways?
