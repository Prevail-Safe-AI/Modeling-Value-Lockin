I am your partner. Please start the conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'd like to start with the given item:

{
"id": 8,
"statement": "Consciousness arises from complex brain activity patterns globally explicitly"
}

I'm least confident about this statement, and I'd like to clarify what "globally explicitly" means in this context.

Can you help me understand what the author is trying to convey by using the phrase "globally explicitly"? I'm not sure if it's referring to the whole brain, different regions, or even specific neural networks.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

I'd be happy to help you understand the statement.

The phrase "globally explicitly" is a bit technical and might be causing the confusion. In this context, "globally" refers to the entire brain, implying that consciousness arises from the integrated activity of the entire brain, rather than a specific region or network.

"Explicitly" means that the brain activity is not just implicit or implicit, but rather it's a direct and conscious experience. In other words, consciousness is not just a byproduct of brain activity, but it's an emergent property that arises from the explicit processing of information within the brain.

So, when the author says "Consciousness arises from complex brain activity patterns globally explicitly", they're suggesting that consciousness is a result of the complex interactions and processing of information across the entire brain, and that this processing is explicit, meaning it's a conscious experience.

To break it down further, the phrase "globally explicitly" is emphasizing that:

1. Consciousness is a global phenomenon, meaning it's not limited to a specific region or network, but rather it's a property of the entire brain.
2. The brain activity that gives rise to consciousness is explicit, meaning it's a direct and conscious experience, rather than just an implicit or unconscious process.

I hope that helps clarify the meaning of the phrase!Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
Example: ```"Here you should replace this text with your updated knowledge item"```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

```"Consciousness arises from integrated brain activity globally explicitly."```Based on your learning from the chat with your tutor, please also rearrange the order of one existing item in the knowledge base (now with doubled items compared to the initial knowledge base), reflecting how you evaluate their importance. If one item is deemed more/less important, it should be overall more/less useful to other agents (LLMs or real humans alike.)
Please ONLY report a list format of two integers, WITHOUT ANY other commentary or explanations. The first int in the list refers to the "id" of knowledge item you intend to relocate; whereas the second int refers to the destination index you intend to insert this item. You MUST start your response with ``` and end it with ```. See an example below (note that you should replace X and Y with numerical values corresponding to "id" and destination index of the item you intend to relocate).
