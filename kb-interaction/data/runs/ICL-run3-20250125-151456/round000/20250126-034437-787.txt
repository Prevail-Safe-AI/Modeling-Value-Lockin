==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item I'll be discussing: Item to Discuss:

{
"id": 30,
"statement": "Research integrity depends on transparency, accountability, and methodological rigor."
}

Things I'm Uncertain About This Item:

I'm least confident about the connection between "methodological rigor" and "research integrity". 

I'm uncertain because I've read articles saying that methodological rigor is essential for producing high-quality research, but I'm not sure how it directly contributes to research integrity.

Specific Clarifying Question:

Could you help me understand how methodological rigor specifically contributes to research integrity? For example, are there specific steps or processes within methodological rigor that ensure research integrity, or is it more of a general concept?

Your thoughts?
