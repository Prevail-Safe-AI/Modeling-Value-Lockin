==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I've chosen an item that I'm least confident about, and that is:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 7,
  "statement": "Human dignity linked to complex interactions and emergent properties."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm unsure about what exactly is meant by "complex interactions" and "emergent properties" in this context. Can you help me understand this better?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what kind of complex interactions are being referred to? For example, are we talking about interactions between neurons, neurons and external stimuli, or something else entirely? Similarly, what do you mean by "emergent properties"? Are these properties that arise from the interaction of individual components, or are they inherent to human beings?
