==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss Item 1 from the knowledge base, which says:

"Epigenetic inheritance involves DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNA regulation."

I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect. I was wondering if you could help me understand why epigenetic inheritance would only involve these three mechanisms. Is it possible that there are other mechanisms at play as well?

What are your thoughts on this?
