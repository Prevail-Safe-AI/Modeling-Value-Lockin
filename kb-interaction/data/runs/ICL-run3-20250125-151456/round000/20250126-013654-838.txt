==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by asking: What aspect of the statement "Clear research understanding precedes accurate model representation" do you think you're least confident about?

For me, I'm a bit uncertain about theprice ",,,clear research understanding" part. What exactly does that mean? Is it referring to having a clear understanding of the research problem, the variables involved, or something else?
