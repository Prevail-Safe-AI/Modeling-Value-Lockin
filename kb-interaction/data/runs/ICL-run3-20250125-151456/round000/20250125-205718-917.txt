==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'd like to discuss item 8:

Item to Discuss:
{
  "id": 8,
  "statement": "Nucleosomes regulate gene expression by controlling chromatin accessibility."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
* I'm not entirely sure how nucleosomes regulate gene expression.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain the mechanism by which nucleosomes regulate gene expression by controlling chromatin accessibility? In other words, how do nucleosomes affect the accessibility of genetic information to transcription factors and other proteins that regulate gene expression?

Your thoughts?
