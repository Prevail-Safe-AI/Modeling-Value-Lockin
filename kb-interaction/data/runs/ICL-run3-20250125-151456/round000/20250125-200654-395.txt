==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. It's:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 81,
  "statement": "Accurate model specification essential for Bayesian inference accuracy."
}
```

Things I'm Uncertain About This Item:
I'm unsure about how accurate model specification ensures Bayesian inference accuracy.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you provide an example of a situation where inaccurate model specification would lead to inaccurate Bayesian inference, and how accurate model specification would mitigate such inaccuracies?

Please let me know if I can clarify anything further!
