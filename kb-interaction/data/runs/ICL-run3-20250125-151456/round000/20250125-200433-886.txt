==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

```
{
  "id": 96,
  "statement": "Cultural, social, and historical contexts define honesty's scope and meaning."
}
```

I'm interested in understanding the concept of honesty better. What do you think about this statement? Do you agree or disagree with it? And if you agree, can you elaborate on what you mean by "scope and meaning" in the context of honesty?

I'm a bit uncertain about how cultural, social, and historical contexts shape the definition of honesty. I think I would like to ask a tutor: Can you provide more examples or examples of how these contexts influence the concept of honesty, especially in different cultures or societies?
