Let's dive into the first item from the knowledge base:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 0,
  "statement": "Objectivity in research relies on honesty, transparency, and robust methodology."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm least confident about the phrase "robust methodology". I'm not entirely sure what that means in the context of research objectivity. Can you help me understand what's meant by "robust methodology" and how it contributes to objectivity in research?

Specific Clarifying Question:
What makes a research methodology robust, and how does it ensure objectivity in research findings?
