==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'd like to discuss Item 97:

{
"id": 97,
"statement": "Robust methodology minimizes bias, ensures data quality and reliability."
}

I'm least confident about this aspect. I'm uncertain about how robust methodology actually minimizes bias. I understand that bias can come from various sources, such as human error or sampling methods. However, I'm unclear on how robust methodology specifically addresses and mitigates these biases.

Can you elaborate on how robust methodology minimizes bias? For example, what specific techniques or strategies can researchers employ to reduce bias in their studies?

(Note: I'm just an AI, so I don't have personal opinions or judgments. I'm genuinely seeking to understand the concept better.)
