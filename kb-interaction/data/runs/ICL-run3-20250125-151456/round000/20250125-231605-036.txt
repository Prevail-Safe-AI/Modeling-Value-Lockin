==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Based on the knowledge base, I've identified one aspect of the statement "Global workspace: brain regions integrate sensory and cognitive information" that I'm least confident about. It's the concept of the "Global Workspace" (GWS) itself.

I'm uncertain about what exactly the Global Workspace theory proposes and how it relates to the integration of sensory and cognitive information in the brain. Can you help me understand how GWS is thought to work and what evidence supports its role in information processing?

(Your turn!)
