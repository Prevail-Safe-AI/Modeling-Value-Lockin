==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I've selected an item that I'm a bit uncertain about, and I'd love to discuss it with you. The item is:

{
"id": 53,
"statement": "Theoretical assumptions shape researcher interpretations and feedback processes."
}

I'm unsure about this item because I'm not entirely clear on what exactly "theoretical assumptions" refers to in the context of research. Could you help me understand this concept better? What kind of theoretical assumptions are we talking about here, and how do they influence researcher interpretations and feedback processes?
