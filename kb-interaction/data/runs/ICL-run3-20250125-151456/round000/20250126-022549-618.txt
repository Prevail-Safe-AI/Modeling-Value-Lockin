==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into it. The item is statement 15: "Intentional recognition and mitigation of biases foster objectivity development." I'm least confident about this aspect because I'm wondering: what exactly does it mean by "intentional recognition and mitigation of biases"? Is this a one-time process or an ongoing effort? And what does it mean by "foster objectivity development"? Is it implying that objectivity is something that can be developed over time?

Can you elaborate on my uncertainty? Am I missing something obvious?
