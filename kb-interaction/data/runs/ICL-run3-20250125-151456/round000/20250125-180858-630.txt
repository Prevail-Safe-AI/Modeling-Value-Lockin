==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by saying that I've been asked to discuss one aspect from this knowledge base that I'm least confident about. And the item that stands out to me is:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 87,
  "statement": "Epigenetic inheritance involves interplay between DNA methylation, histone modifications, and ncRNA regulation."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

Honestly, I'm not entirely sure how these three components - DNA methylation, histone modifications, and ncRNA regulation - interact with each other to facilitate epigenetic inheritance. Can you help me understand the relationship between them and why they're so crucial in epigenetic inheritance?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on how these three components specifically interact with each other, and what kind of mechanisms might be in play to allow for epigenetic inheritance?

Please feel free to clarify or correct me, and I'd love to learn more about this topic!
