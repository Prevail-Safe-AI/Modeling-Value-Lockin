==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'd like to discuss item #2:

{
"id": 2,
"statement": "Objectivity is achieved through harmonious synergy of honesty, transparency, methodology."
}

I'm not entirely confident about this aspect of objectivity in research. Specifically, I'm uncertain about what "harmonious synergy" really means in this context.

Elaborate, please! What do you think "harmonious synergy" refers to in this statement?
