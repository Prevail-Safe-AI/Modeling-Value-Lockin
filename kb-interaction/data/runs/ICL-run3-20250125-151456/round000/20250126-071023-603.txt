==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive in!

The item from the knowledge base I'd like to discuss is:

{
"id": 89,
"statement": "Cognitive heuristics influence research outcomes through subtle biases."
}

I'd say I'm moderately uncertain about this aspect. Here's why:

I understand what cognitive heuristics are - they're mental shortcuts or rules of thumb that help us make decisions or judgments more efficiently. But I'm not entirely sure how they can influence research outcomes through subtle biases. Are these biases intentional or unintentional? How do they manifest in research design, data collection, or analysis?

To clarify, I'd love to ask:

1. Can you provide some concrete examples of how cognitive heuristics can lead to subtle biases in research, and how they can affect the outcome of a study?

Your input would be super helpful in helping me better understand this concept!
