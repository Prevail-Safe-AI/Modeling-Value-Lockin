==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into a specific item from the knowledge base. Item 90 catches my attention: "Epigenetic modifications can influence gene expression through multiple mechanisms."

I'm least confident about this item. I'm unsure why epigenetic modifications, which are changes to gene expression without altering the DNA sequence, can influence gene expression through multiple mechanisms.

Can you elaborate on why you think epigenetic modifications can have multiple mechanisms to influence gene expression?
