Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 37,
  "statement": "Systematic errors in research design and analysis lead to inaccurate conclusions."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not entirely sure how to identify "systematic errors" in research design and analysis. Can you explain what you understand by this phrase?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you provide an example of a systematic error in research design and analysis that led to an inaccurate conclusion?
