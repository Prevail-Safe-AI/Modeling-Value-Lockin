==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into it. I've been tasked with reviewing the knowledge base and I'm going to start with item 78. The statement is "Emotional regulation enhances introspection's accuracy through reduced distractions."

I'm not entirely confident about this item. Can you help me understand what's meant by "reduced distractions" in this context?

What kind of distractions are we talking about, and how does emotional regulation specifically reduce them?
