==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with Item 27. It talks about rip currents forming due to wind, tides, and coastal geometry. I'm a bit uncertain about this item. I'd like to know more about why these factors specifically contribute to the formation of rip currents.

Can you help me understand the relationship between wind, tides, and coastal geometry in relation to rip currents? Is there a specific mechanism or process at play here?
