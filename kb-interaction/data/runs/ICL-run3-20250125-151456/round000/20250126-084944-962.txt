==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's discuss item 61. According to the statement, "Organizational culture shapes research methodology through implicit norms." 

I'm a bit uncertain about this item because I wonder what exactly are these "implicit norms" that organizational culture shapes research methodology through. Are they just unwritten rules that researchers follow, or are they more complex and deep-seated?

Can you help me better understand this concept?
