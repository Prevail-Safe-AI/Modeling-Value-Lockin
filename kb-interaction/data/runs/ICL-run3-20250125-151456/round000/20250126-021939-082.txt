Let's discuss the knowledge base item with id 46.

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 46,
  "statement": "Mindfulness meditation reduces mind-wandering, increasing self-awareness through TPN activity."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm least confident about the part that mentions "TPN activity". I'm not sure what TPN activity stands for or what its relation is to mindfulness meditation and self-awareness. Can you elaborate on this aspect?

Specific Clarifying Question:
What does TPN activity refer to, and how does it contribute to the increased self-awareness resulting from mindfulness meditation?
