==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let me start by saying that I'm going to discuss item #3 from the knowledge base, which is:

{
"id": 3,
"statement": "Epigenetic marks involve chromatin, DNA methylation, and histone modifications.'"
}

I'm least confident about this item because I'm not exactly sure what chromatin, DNA methylation, and histone modifications are, or how they're related to epigenetic marks.

Can you elaborate on what these terms mean and how they fit into the concept of epigenetic marks?
