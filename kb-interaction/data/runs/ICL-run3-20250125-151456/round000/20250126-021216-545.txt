Let's dive into the knowledge base item. I'd like to discuss item 91:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 91,
"statement": "Self-awareness recognizes own biases, fostering empathy and inclusivity."
}

Things I'm Uncertain About This Item:

* Well, I'm not entirely sure how exactly self-awareness recognizes own biases. Can you elaborate on what you think is meant by this statement?

Specific Clarifying Question:
How do you think self-awareness actually recognizes and acknowledges own biases, and how does this lead to fostering empathy and inclusivity?
