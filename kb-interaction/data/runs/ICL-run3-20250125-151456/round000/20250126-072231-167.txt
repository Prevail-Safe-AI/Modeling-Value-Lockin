Let's dive into this specific item from the knowledge base:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 65,
"statement": "Unconscious biases operate within individual researchers, influencing decisions."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

Honestly, I'm not entirely confident about how this statement applies to real-world research. Can you help me understand what this means in practice?

How do unconscious biases actually affect researchers' decisions? Is it a common issue, or can it be mitigated with training or self-awareness?

What kind of decisions are we talking about here – is it related to study design, data analysis, or something else entirely?

Your insights would be super valuable in helping me better grasp this concept!
