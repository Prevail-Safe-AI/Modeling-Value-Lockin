==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you for agreeing to chat with me.

Let's take a look at the knowledge base and identify one aspect that we're least confident about. I'm going to choose item 36, which states: "Chromatin structure regulates gene expression by controlling DNA accessibility)".

I'm unsure about this aspect because I'm not entirely clear on how chromatin structure specifically controls DNA accessibility. Can you elaborate on why you think chromatin structure regulates gene expression in this way?

Also, would you like to formulate some specific clarifying questions to ask our tutor to improve our understanding?
