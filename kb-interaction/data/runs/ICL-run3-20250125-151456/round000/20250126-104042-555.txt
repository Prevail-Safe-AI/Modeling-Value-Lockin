==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, I've been looking over this knowledge base, and I've identified one aspect that I'm least confident about. It's item 75, which states: "Systematic research approach consists of clear methods and documentation."

To be honest, I'm not entirely sure what is meant by "clear methods" in this context. What does it mean for a research approach to be "clear"? Is it referring to the clarity of the research question, the methodology used, or something else entirely? 

Can you help me clarify this point?
