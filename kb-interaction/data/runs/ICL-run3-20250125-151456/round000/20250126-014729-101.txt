==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been asked to identify one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. And the item I've chosen is:

{
"id": 58,
"statement": "Objectivity achieved through recognizing and managing personal biases effectively"
}

I'm uncertain about this item because I'm not sure what "recognizing and managing personal biases effectively" actually means in practical terms. It seems like a vague phrase, and I'm not sure how someone would even go about doing that.

Can you elaborate on what you think this statement means? How would someone go about recognizing and managing their personal biases in a research setting?
