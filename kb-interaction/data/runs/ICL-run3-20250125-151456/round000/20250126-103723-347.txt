==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, I've been asked to identify one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. The item is:

{
"id": 42,
"statement": "Clear definitions necessary but insufficient for generalizability alone."
}

I think I'm uncertain about this item because I'm not entirely sure what it means by "generalizability alone". What do you think? Can you help me clarify that?
