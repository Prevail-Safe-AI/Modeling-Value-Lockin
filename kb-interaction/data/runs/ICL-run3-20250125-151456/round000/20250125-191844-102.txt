==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by saying that I've been asked to discuss one item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. The item I've chosen is:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 32,
  "statement": "Bayes' theorem requires assumptions of independence and identifiability"
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not entirely sure why Bayes' theorem requires assumptions of independence and identifiability. I know that independence is an assumption that ensures the probability of two events are not correlated, but I'm not fully understanding how identifiability comes into play.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand why identifiability is necessary for Bayes' theorem? How does it relate to the concept of independence?

What are your thoughts?
