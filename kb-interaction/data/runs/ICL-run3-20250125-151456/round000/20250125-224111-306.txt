==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thanks for the enthusiastic response!

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 78,
"statement": "Personal biases can influence prior distribution selection in Bayesian analysis."
}

I'm least confident about this aspect. I'm not sure how personal biases can actually influence prior distribution selection in Bayesian analysis. Can you elaborate on why you think this is the case?
