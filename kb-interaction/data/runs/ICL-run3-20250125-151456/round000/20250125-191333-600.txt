==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by discussing the item from the knowledge base:

Item to Discuss:
{
  "id": 25,
  "statement": "Independence and identifiability assumptions ensure Bayes' theorem accuracy"
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I’m least confident about the statement that “Independence and identifiability assumptions ensure Bayes' theorem accuracy”. 

Elaborate why you’re uncertain about that aspect:
I'm unsure because I've only seen Bayes' theorem used in simple statistical problems where the independence and identifiability assumptions seemed to hold. In more complex real-world problems, I'm not confident that the independence and identifiability assumptions are always met, and I wonder how this affects the accuracy of the theorem. Maybe in more advanced statistics classes or research, there's more nuance to this topic?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you explain how the independence and identifiability assumptions are typically checked in practice, and what are some common scenarios where these assumptions are not met?
