==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. That item is:

{
"id": 50,
"statement": "Methodological rigor ensures research quality and reliability through systematic design."
}

I'm uncertain about this item because I'm not entirely sure what is meant by "systematic design" in this context. Is it referring to a specific methodology or approach? How does this relate to ensuring research quality and reliability?

Can you help me clarify this point?
