==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the statement "Internal biases are shaped by interconnected personal, cultural, and environmental contexts impacting research integrity." I'm least confident about this aspect.

Things I'm Uncertain About This Item:
* I'm unsure about how exactly these internal biases are shaped. For example, what specific ways do personal, cultural, and environmental contexts influence our biases?

Specific Clarifying Questions:
* Can you elaborate on what you mean by "interconnected personal, cultural, and environmental contexts"? Are these context factors that we're exposed to in daily life, or are they more subtle influences that shape our thinking?
* How do these contexts impact our internal biases? Is it a cumulative effect, or are there specific circumstances that trigger biases?

Your thoughts?
