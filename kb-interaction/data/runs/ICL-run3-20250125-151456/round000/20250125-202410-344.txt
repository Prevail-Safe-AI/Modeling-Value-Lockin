==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm going to take the item:

```
{
  "id": 3,
  "statement": "Cultural context influences honesty's definition, shaping societal norms and values."
}
```

I'm least confident about this item because I'm not sure what exactly is meant by "cultural context influences honesty's definition". For example, how does culture shape the definition of honesty? Is it just a matter of different norms and values, or is there something more subtle going on?

Can you help me clarify this?

Specific clarifying question: Can you elaborate on what you mean by "cultural context influences honesty's definition"?
