==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 90:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 90,
"statement": "Epigenetic marks and histone modifications regulate gene expression dynamically."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm less confident about how this item relates to the broader concept of epigenetics and gene expression. Can you help me clarify this?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain how epigenetic marks and histone modifications interact with each other to dynamically regulate gene expression? Are there specific genes or biological processes that are heavily influenced by these interactions?
