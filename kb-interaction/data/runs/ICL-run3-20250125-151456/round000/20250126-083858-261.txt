==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss Item 90 from the knowledge base. It says: "Consistency ensures reliability and generalizability in research through rigorous methods."

I'm not completely confident about this aspect. I'm uncertain about what exactly it means by "through rigorous methods". Can you help me understand this better?

For example, what kind of methods are they referring to? Is it about rigorously following a specific procedure, or is it about using certain statistical methods to ensure reliability and generalizability?
