==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the item:

{
"id": 88,
"statement": "Researchers can mitigate assumptions and biases through self-reflection and transparency."
}

I'm a bit uncertain about this item. I'd like to know more about what constitutes "self-reflection" in this context. Is it just being aware of one's own biases, or is it actively trying to identify and manage them? And how does transparency come into play in mitigating assumptions and biases?

What are your thoughts on this?
