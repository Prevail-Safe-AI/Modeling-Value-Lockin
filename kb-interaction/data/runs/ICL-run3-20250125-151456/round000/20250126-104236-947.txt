==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss Item 63: "Methodological transparency includes multiple factors beyond written descriptions."

I'm actually least confident about this item. I'm unsure about the scope of what constitutes "multiple factors beyond written descriptions". It seems straightforward that written descriptions are part of methodological transparency, but what other factors could be included?

Can you help me clarify this?
