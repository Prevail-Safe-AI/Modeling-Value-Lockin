==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into it. I'm supposed to identify one aspect of this knowledge base that I'm least confident about, which is the item:

{
"id": 63,
"statement": "Theoretical assumptions stem from implicit cognitive frameworks and biases."
}

I'm a bit uncertain about the phrase "implicit cognitive frameworks". Can you help me understand what that means in the context of research?

Specifically, I'd love to know: What do you mean by "implicit cognitive frameworks", and how do these frameworks influence theoretical assumptions in research?
