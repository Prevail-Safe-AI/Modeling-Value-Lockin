==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about, which is the item:

{
"id": 96,
"statement": "Epigenetic inheritance influenced by histone-DNA methylation complex interactions."
}

I'm uncertain about this item because I'm not sure how histone-DNA methylation complex interactions influence epigenetic inheritance. Is this a crucial interaction in the process of epigenetic inheritance, or is it one of many factors that contribute to it?

Can you elaborate on how these interactions work together to influence epigenetic inheritance, and what the implications of this influence are?
