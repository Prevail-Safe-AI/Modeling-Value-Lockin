==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, let's dive into this item: `{ "id": 94, "statement": "Cultural norms influence moral values, but honesty remains universal" }`. I'm a bit uncertain about this item.

I'm unsure how honesty can remain universal while cultural norms influence moral values. It seems like a contradiction. Can you help me understand how these two ideas can coexist?

What are your thoughts on this?
