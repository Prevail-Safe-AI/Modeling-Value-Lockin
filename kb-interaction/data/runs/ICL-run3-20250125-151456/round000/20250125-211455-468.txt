==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I've been tasked to identify one aspect of this item that I'm least confident about.

The item is:

{
"id": 71,
"statement": "Accurate model specification alone is insufficient for reliability."
}

I'm uncertain about this item because I'm not entirely sure why accurate model specification alone is not enough to guarantee reliability. Isn't accurate modeling a crucial step in Bayesian inference?

Can you help me clarify this? What's the reasoning behind this statement?

And to improve my understanding, I'd love to ask a specific clarifying question: 

"Can you provide an example of a situation where accurate model specification is not sufficient for reliability in Bayesian inference, and how do you ensure reliability in such cases?"

What are your thoughts?
