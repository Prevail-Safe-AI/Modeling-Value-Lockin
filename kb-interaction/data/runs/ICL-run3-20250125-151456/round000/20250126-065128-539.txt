==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into it. I've chosen Item 93 from the knowledge base:

"Theoretical frameworks can influence research design and methodology unintentionally, shaping assumptions."

I'm least confident about this aspect because I'm not entirely sure what they mean by "influencing research design and methodology unintentionally". I understand that theoretical frameworks are guiding principles for research, but how exactly can they unintentionally shape assumptions in the research process?

Can you help me understand this concept better?

(e.g. what do you think they mean by "unintentionally"? How does this happen in practice?)
