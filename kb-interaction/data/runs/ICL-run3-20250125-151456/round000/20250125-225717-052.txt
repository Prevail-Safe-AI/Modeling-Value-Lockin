Let's discuss the item from the knowledge base:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 38,
"statement": "Consciousness arises from integrated global brain processes' coordination."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

I'm uncertain about how exactly consciousness arises from the coordination of global brain processes. I'm not sure if it's a specific mechanism, like a certain type of neural activity, or if it's more of a general principle, like the integration of multiple brain regions.

Specific Clarifying Question:

Can you help me understand the nature of this coordination and what specific brain processes are involved in giving rise to consciousness?
