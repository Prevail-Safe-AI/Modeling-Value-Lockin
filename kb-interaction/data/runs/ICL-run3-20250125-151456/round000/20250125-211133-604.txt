==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm glad we can discuss this.itemid 98, which states "Epigenetic modifications alter chromatin structure through histone-DNA interactions and chromatin remodeling." I'm a bit uncertain about this item because I don't fully understand the relationship between histone-DNA interactions and chromatin remodeling in epigenetic modifications.
