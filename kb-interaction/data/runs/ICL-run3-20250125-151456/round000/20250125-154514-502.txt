Let's take a look at the knowledge base item:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 85,
"statement": "Morality encompasses personal responsibility, empathy, and reciprocity in decision-making."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

I'm least confident about how the statement incorporates personal responsibility, empathy, and reciprocity in decision-making. Can you help me understand how these concepts are interconnected or implemented in moral decision-making?

Specific Clarifying Questions:
What does it mean by "personal responsibility" in the context of morality? Can you provide some examples of how personal responsibility might influence decision-making in moral dilemmas?
