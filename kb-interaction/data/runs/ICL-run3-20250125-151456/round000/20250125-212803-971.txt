==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's discuss the statement: "Accurate model specification is insufficient for reliability when isolated."

I'm least confident about this aspect: "when isolated". I'm not entirely sure what it means by "isolated". Could you elaborate on what this phrase implies?

Also, can you help me understand the context of this statement? Is it specifically talking about Bayesian inference, and if so, what aspect of Bayesian inference is it referring to?
