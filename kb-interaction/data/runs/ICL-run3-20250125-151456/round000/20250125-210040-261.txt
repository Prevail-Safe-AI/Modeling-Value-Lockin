==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm supposed to identify one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. And since I've never seen this knowledge base before, I'd like to take a closer look at each statement to see which one makes me feel uncertain.

Let me scan through the statements... Ah, I think I've found one that catches my attention. Item 25 states: "Prior assumptions influence model parameters through Bayesian posterior distributions."

What makes me uncertain about this item is that I'm not entirely sure what "Bayesian posterior distributions" means in the context of Bayesian inference. Can you help me understand what this phrase refers to?
