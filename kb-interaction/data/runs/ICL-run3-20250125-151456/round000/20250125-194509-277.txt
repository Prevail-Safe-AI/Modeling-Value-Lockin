==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by discussing the item: 

{
  "id": 62,
  "statement": "Histone modifications regulate chromatin structure and gene expression via multiple mechanisms."
}

I'm least confident about the fact that histone modifications regulate chromatin structure and gene expression via multiple mechanisms. I'm not sure what these mechanisms are or how they work. Can you help me understand this better?
