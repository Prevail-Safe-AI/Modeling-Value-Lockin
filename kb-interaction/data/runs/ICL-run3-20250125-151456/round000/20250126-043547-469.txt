==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'd like to discuss item #13:

"Research integrity arises from harmonious combination of honesty, integrity, and rigor."

I'm least confident about this item. I'm wondering why honesty, integrity, and rigor need to be combined harmoniously to achieve research integrity.

Could you elaborate on what you think is the importance of having a harmonious combination of these three elements?

(And I'll try to formulate some specific clarifying questions later!)
