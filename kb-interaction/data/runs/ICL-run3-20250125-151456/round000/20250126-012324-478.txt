==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been reviewing the knowledge base, and I'm least confident about the item:

{
"id": 87,
"statement": "Bayesian analysis relies heavily on subjective prior probability assignments."
}

I'm uncertain because I'm not entirely sure what "subjective prior probability assignments" means in the context of Bayesian analysis. Can you help me understand this better?

What do you think "subjective prior probability assignments" refers to in this context? How do prior probabilities play a role in Bayesian analysis?
