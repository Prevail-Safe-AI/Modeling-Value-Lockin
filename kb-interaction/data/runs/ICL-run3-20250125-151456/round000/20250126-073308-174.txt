Let's discuss the item from the knowledge base:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 85,
  "statement": "Uniformity in research ensures reliability, validity, and generalizability."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

I'm not entirely confident about the statement because I'm not sure what kind of "uniformity" is being referred to in the context of research. Is it about the methodology, data collection, analysis, or something else?

Can you elaborate on why you think uniformity is important in research?
