==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into it. I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 79,
"statement": "Systematic research integrates methodology, design, and procedures effectively."
}

I'm least confident about the part that says "Systematic research integrates methodology, design, and procedures effectively". 

I'm unsure about what exactly "integrate" means in this context, and how it would be applied in a research setting. For example, what does it mean for methodology, design, and procedures to be integrated effectively? Are there specific steps or techniques that need to be followed?

Can you elaborate on why you think the integration of these components is important in systematic research?
