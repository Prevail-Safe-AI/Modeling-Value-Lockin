==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's take a look at the knowledge base item: 

```
{
  "id": 45,
  "statement": "Comprehensive problem comprehension involves situational awareness, context, and perspectives."
}
```

I'm going to identify one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. That aspect is:

"Comprehensive problem comprehension involves situational awareness, context, and perspectives."

I'm uncertain about what these three components - situational awareness, context, and perspectives - exactly mean in the context of problem comprehension. What do you think they refer to?

Can you elaborate on why you're uncertain about this aspect, and can you formulate specific clarifying questions to improve your understanding?
