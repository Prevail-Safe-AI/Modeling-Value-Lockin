==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item: `{ "id": 66, "statement": "Cultural and personal biases affect trust-building in complex ways." }`. I'm least confident about this item.

I'm uncertain because I'm not sure what exactly constitutes "complex ways" in this context. I can imagine cultural and personal biases influencing our trust-building processes, but the phrase "in complex ways" leaves me wondering how and why.

Can you help me clarify this? What specific examples or scenarios can you think of where cultural and personal biases have affected trust-building in a complex manner?
