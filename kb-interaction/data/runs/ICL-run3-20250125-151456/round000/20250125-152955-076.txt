==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item. I'd like to discuss item #88:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 88,
  "statement": "Wealth distribution fosters societal well-being and individual freedom."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm uncertain about the relationship between wealth distribution and its impact on societal well-being and individual freedom.

Can you elaborate on why you think wealth distribution affects these two concepts, and what specific factors contribute to this relationship?

Also, do you think there are any counterarguments or limitations to this statement?
