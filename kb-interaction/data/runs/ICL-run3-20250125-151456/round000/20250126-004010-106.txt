==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item.

Item to Discuss:
{
  "id": 71,
  "statement": "Bayesian inference updates prior distribution with new evidence."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm least confident about how Bayesian inference actually updates the prior distribution with new evidence. I'm not entirely sure what's happening behind the scenes, and I'd like some clarification.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain to me what happens to the prior distribution when new evidence is incorporated through Bayesian inference? How does the process of updating the prior distribution work, exactly?
