==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the item:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 4,
  "statement": "Cultural norms significantly shape moral judgments about honesty."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not sure about the extent to which cultural norms shape moral judgments about honesty. I'm wondering if culture plays a role in determining what is considered honest or dishonest, or if moral judgments about honesty are more absolute.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what you mean by "significantly shape"? Is there a specific example or study that demonstrates the impact of cultural norms on moral judgments about honesty?
