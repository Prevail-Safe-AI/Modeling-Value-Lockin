==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item from the knowledge base:

```json
{
  "id": 94,
  "statement": "Reproducibility relies on both consistent documentation and rigorous research methods."
}
```

I'm least confident about this item. I'm not sure what specific aspects of research documentation and methodology are meant by "consistent documentation" and "rigorous research methods". Could you help me understand what you think these phrases entail?

Also, what are some examples of "consistent documentation" that would ensure reproducibility?
