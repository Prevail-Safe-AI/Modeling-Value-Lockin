==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item: 

Item to Discuss:
{
  "id": 7,
  "statement": "Epigenetic modifications influence gene expression without changing DNA sequence."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

I'm uncertain about how epigenetic modifications can influence gene expression without changing the DNA sequence. I want to understand better how this works, and what the implications are for our understanding of gene regulation.

Specific Clarifying Question:

Can you explain, in simpler terms, how epigenetic modifications can regulate gene expression when the DNA sequence itself remains unchanged?

What are your thoughts on this?
