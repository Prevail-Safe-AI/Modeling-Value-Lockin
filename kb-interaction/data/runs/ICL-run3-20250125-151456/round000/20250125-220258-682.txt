==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been reviewing the knowledge base, and I've identified one aspect that I'm least confident about. It's item 22:

{
"id": 22,
"statement": "Epigenetic modifications regulate gene expression through histone modification."
}

I'm unsure about how epigenetic modifications can specifically regulate gene expression through histone modification. Can you help me understand the relationship between these two concepts better?

What's the mechanism by which histone modification affects gene expression, and how do epigenetic modifications exploit this to regulate gene expression? I'm a bit unclear on the details.

Do you have any insights or clarifying questions you'd ask a tutor to improve your understanding?
