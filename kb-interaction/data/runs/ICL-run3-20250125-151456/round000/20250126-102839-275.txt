==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 9,
"statement": "Clear definitions contribute to both research consistency and generalizability."
}

I'm not entirely confident about this aspect. What makes me uncertain is that I'm not sure how clear definitions specifically contribute to research consistency and generalizability. Is it because clear definitions help reduce ambiguity and ensure that everyone is on the same page? Or is there something more to it?

Can you provide some insight or clarify this concept for me?
