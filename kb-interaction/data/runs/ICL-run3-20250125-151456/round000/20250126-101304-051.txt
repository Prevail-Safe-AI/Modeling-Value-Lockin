==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by discussing item 1 from the knowledge base:

{
"-id": 1,
"statement": "Research integrity involves harmonious synergy of honesty and methodology."
}

I'm least confident about the aspect "harmonious synergy". Can you elaborate why you think harmony between honesty and methodology is essential for research integrity?

(By the way, I'll be taking notes of our conversation to better understand the knowledge base and improve our discussion.)
