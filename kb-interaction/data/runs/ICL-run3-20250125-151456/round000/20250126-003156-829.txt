==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the task we were given. We need to identify one aspect of the knowledge base that we're least confident about. For me, that item is:

Item to Discuss:
{
  "id": 19,
  "statement": "A conceptual framework serves as a theoretical structure guiding research."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not really sure what "theoretical structure" means in this context. Could you explain what you think it means?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you elaborate on what kind of guidance a conceptual framework provides to research, and how it differs from other types of frameworks or structures?
