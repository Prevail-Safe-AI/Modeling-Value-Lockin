==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item:

{
"id": 48,
"statement": "Certain biases can emerge in Bayesian modeling from unclear assumptions."
}

I'm initially least confident about this item because I'm not quite sure what's meant by "unclear assumptions" in the context of Bayesian modeling. Can you elaborate on what kinds of assumptions might be considered unclear and how they can lead to biases in Bayesian modeling?
