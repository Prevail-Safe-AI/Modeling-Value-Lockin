==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's take a look at the knowledge base item:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 42,
"statement": "Bayes' theorem relies fundamentally on independence assumption accuracy."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm least confident about the statement that Bayes' theorem relies fundamentally on independence assumption accuracy.

Elaborating, I'm uncertain about whether independence assumption is a critical component of Bayes' theorem. I'm not convinced that the theorem cannot be applied without independence assumption or that the accuracy of the theorem depends solely on independence assumption accuracy.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can independence assumption be relaxed or ignored in certain scenarios, or is it a necessary component for Bayes' theorem to produce accurate results?

What are your thoughts on this?
