==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. Based on the item:

```
{
  "id": 83,
  "statement": "Researcher bias arises from individual and contextual factors."
}
```

I'm least confident about this aspect: the idea that researcher bias arises from individual and contextual factors.

I'm uncertain about this because I'm not entirely convinced that individual and contextual factors are the only causes of researcher bias. I'm wondering if there might be other factors at play that we're not considering. For example, what about the role of societal pressures, funding sources, or historical and cultural contexts in shaping researcher bias?

Can you help me clarify my understanding of this item? Do you have any insights or perspectives on how individual and contextual factors might influence researcher bias?

Also, I'd love to ask a specific clarifying question to improve my understanding: What are some examples of individual and contextual factors that can contribute to researcher bias, and how do these factors intersect or interact with each other to influence research outcomes?
