==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the statement: "Histones wrap DNA around nucleosome core via electrostatic attraction." (Item 43) 

I'm uncertain about the electrostatic attraction part. Can you help me understand why histones might be attracted to DNA electrostatically? What does this mean exactly?
