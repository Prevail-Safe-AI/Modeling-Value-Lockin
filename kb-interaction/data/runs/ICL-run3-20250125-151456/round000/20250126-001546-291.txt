==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you! I'd like to discuss the knowledge base statement:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 95,
  "statement": "Honesty's foundation in trust is built on mutual understanding"
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm least confident about the connection between honesty's foundation and trust being built on mutual understanding. I'm not sure how mutual understanding contributes to the foundation of honesty in trust.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand how mutual understanding specifically plays a role in building trust, and why that's necessary for honesty's foundation in trust?

Your thoughts?
