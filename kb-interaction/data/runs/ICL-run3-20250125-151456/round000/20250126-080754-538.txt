==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the aspect of the knowledge base statement that I'm least confident about. The item is:

{
"	id": 97,
"statement": "Honesty, transparency, and methodology are interconnected research integrity components."
}

I'm not entirely sure what it means by "interconnected research integrity components". Can you help me clarify what this statement is trying to convey?

What do you think this statement is trying to say? Is it just listing three important components of research integrity, or is there a deeper connection between them?
