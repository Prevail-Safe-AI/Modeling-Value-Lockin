==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into it. I've been asked to discuss a specific item from the knowledge base, which is:

{
"id": 89,
"statement": "Data noise refers to errors or inconsistencies in datasets."
}

I'm least confident about this item, and I'd like to understand it better. I'm uncertain about what exactly constitutes "errors or inconsistencies" in datasets. Can you help me clarify this?

Can you explain what you think "data noise" refers to in this context? Do you think it's limited to mistakes or typos in the data, or is it a broader concept that includes other types of variability or inaccuracies?
