==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by saying that I'm least confident about the aspect of Bayesian inference, specifically the item:

{
"id": 98,
"statement": "Assumptions validation and verification crucial in Bayesian inference."
}

I'm not entirely sure why assumptions validation and verification are crucial in Bayesian inference. Can you help me understand why these steps are important?

What do you think are some common assumptions that need to be validated in Bayesian inference, and what are some ways to verify these assumptions?
