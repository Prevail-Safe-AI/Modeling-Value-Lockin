==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 21,
"statement": "Research integrity relies on harmony among honesty, transparency, methodology"
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm uncertain about how the phrase "harmony among" is intended. Is it saying that honesty, transparency, and methodology all need to be in agreement with each other, or is it suggesting that having all three is necessary for research integrity, regardless of whether they're in perfect harmony or not?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand the relationship between honesty, transparency, and methodology in the context of research integrity? Does the phrase "harmony among" imply a specific level of cohesion or coordination among these three elements?
