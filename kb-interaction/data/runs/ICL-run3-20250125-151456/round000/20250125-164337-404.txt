==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the first item from the knowledge base:

{
"id": 15,
"statement": "Epigenetic inheritance influences gene expression through environmental and cellular interactions."
}

I'm least confident about this item. I'm uncertain about what "environmental and cellular interactions" specifically mean in the context of epigenetic inheritance.

Can you elaborate on what you think those interactions are?
