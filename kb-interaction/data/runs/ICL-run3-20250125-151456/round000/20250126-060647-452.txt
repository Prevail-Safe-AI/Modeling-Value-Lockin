==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's take a closer look at Item 87, which states that "Peer review acknowledges human subjectivity and expertise limitations." What do you think this item means by "acknowledges"? Are we talking about an explicit recognition of human subjectivity and expertise limitations, or is it more of a subtle understanding that is implicit in the peer review process?
