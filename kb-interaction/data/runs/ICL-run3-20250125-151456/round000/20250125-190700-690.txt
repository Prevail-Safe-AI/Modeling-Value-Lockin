==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's explore the knowledge base together. I've chosen an item that I'm least confident about, which is:

{
"id": 84,
"statement": "Epigenetic modifications affect chromatin structure without altering DNA sequence through histone modification"
}

I'm unsure about this item because I don't fully understand the relationship between histone modification and chromatin structure. Can you help me clarify this concept?

Here's my first question: How do histone modifications specifically influence chromatin structure, and what are some examples of epigenetic modifications that can affect chromatin accessibility and transcription factor binding?
