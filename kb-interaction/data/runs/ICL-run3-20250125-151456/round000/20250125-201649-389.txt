==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item from the knowledge base:

```
{
  "id": 30,
  "statement": "Bayes' theorem's independence assumption is a conditional probability concept"
}
```

I'm uncertain about this item, and I'd like to clarify my understanding. I think I'm least confident about the relationship between the independence assumption and conditional probability. Can you help me understand why the independence assumption might be considered a conditional probability concept? In other words, what is the connection between these two concepts?

Also, what is meant by "conditional probability" in this context?
