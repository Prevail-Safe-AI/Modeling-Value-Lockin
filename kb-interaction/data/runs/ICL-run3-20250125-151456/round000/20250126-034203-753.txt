==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I've chosen an item that I'm least confident about. It's:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 11,
"statement": "Peer recognition stems from expertise, impact and reputation among peers."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm unsure about the relationship between expertise, impact, and reputation. How do these factors exactly contribute to peer recognition? Is there a specific order or hierarchy among them?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on how these factors are interconnected, and what specific outcomes or behaviors are associated with peer recognition based on these factors?

What are your thoughts on this?
