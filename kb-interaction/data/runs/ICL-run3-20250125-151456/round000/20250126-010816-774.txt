==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item from the knowledge base that I've chosen to discuss:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 43,
  "statement": "Lying can be morally acceptable in exceptional circumstances like protecting innocent lives."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

I'm uncertain about the exceptionality of circumstances that would make lying morally acceptable. I'm not sure what specific scenarios would justify lying to protect innocent lives.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you provide examples of such exceptional circumstances where lying could be morally acceptable to protect innocent lives? How would we determine what constitutes such exceptional circumstances?
