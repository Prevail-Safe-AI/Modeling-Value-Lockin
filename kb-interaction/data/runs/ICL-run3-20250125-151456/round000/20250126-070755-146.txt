==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start by discussing the item:

{
"id": 90,
"statement": "Honesty, transparency, and rigor are essential research quality markers."
}

I'm least confident about this item because I'm not entirely sure what the boundaries of each quality marker are. For example, what specifically falls under "honesty" in research? Is it limited to reporting accurate results or does it also include avoiding deliberate misinformation?

Can you help me clarify this?
