==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've chosen an item from the knowledge base and I'd like to discuss it with you. The item is:

Item to Discuss:
{
  "id": 31,
  "statement": "Cultural norms shape moral judgments through social learning processes."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm uncertain about how exactly cultural norms shape moral judgments. I'm not sure what is meant by "social learning processes" in this context.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what is meant by "social learning processes" in this statement, and how do cultural norms influence moral judgments through these processes?
