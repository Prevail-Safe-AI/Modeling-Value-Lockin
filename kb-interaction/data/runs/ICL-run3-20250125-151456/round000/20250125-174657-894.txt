==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let me think for a moment... Okay, I've got it! Item #82 is claiming that epigenetic inheritance involves histone modification, DNA methylation, and ncRNA interactions. That sounds like a lot of molecular biology stuff, and I'm not super confident in my understanding of it.

Can you tell me what each of those terms means, and how they specifically interact to lead to epigenetic inheritance? Like, what is the mechanism behind it?
