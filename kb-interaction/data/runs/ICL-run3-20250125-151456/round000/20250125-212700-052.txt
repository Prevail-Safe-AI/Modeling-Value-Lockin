==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 10,
"statement": "Honesty is a crucial, yet not sufficient condition"
}

I'm a bit uncertain about this statement, particularly about what it means by "a crucial condition". Can you help clarify that for me? For example, does it mean that honesty is necessary, but not the only thing, required for something to work or be successful?
