==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's focus on the item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. That item is:

{
"id": 20,
"statement": "Accurate prior distribution requires iterative refinement and model validation."
}

I'm uncertain about the term "iterative refinement" in this statement. Can you explain what is meant by "iterative refinement" in the context of prior distribution and Bayesian modeling?
