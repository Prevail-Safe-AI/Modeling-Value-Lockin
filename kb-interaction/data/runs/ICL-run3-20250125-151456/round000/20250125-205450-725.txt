==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'd like to discuss the item: {

  "id": 9,
  "statement": "Accurate model specification ensures robust conclusions in Bayesian inference."
}

I'm least confident about this item because I'm not entirely sure what "robust conclusions" means in the context of Bayesian inference. Can you elaborate on what it means by "robust conclusions" and how accurate model specification achieves that?

Also, what specific factors does the statement imply are dependent on accurate model specification for "robust conclusions" in Bayesian inference?
