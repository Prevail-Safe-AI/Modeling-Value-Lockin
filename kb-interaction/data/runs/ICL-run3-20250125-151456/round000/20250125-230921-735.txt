==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the item from the knowledge base. The item is:

```
{
  "id": 76,
  "statement": "Objective uncertainty reflects inherent data or system randomness."
}
```

I'm going to choose this item because I'm not entirely confident about the concept of objective uncertainty. Can you help me understand what this statement means and what kind of uncertainty is being referred to?

For example, what do they mean by "inherent data or system randomness"? Is it talking about some fundamental limitation of measurement or something else entirely?
