==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, let's dive into the first item:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 46,
"statement": "Internal biases result from complex interplay of internal and external factors"
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

Honestly, I'm not entirely confident about the phrase "complex interplay of internal and external factors". Can you help me understand what that means in the context of internal biases?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you provide an example of how internal and external factors might interact to produce internal biases, and how we can recognize or mitigate these biases in research?

What are your thoughts?
