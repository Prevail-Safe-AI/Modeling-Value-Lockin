==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss Item 33: "Complex systems simplification through abstraction leads to better understanding."

I'm uncertain about this aspect. Specifically, I'm not sure why abstraction would lead to better understanding in complex systems. Can you elaborate on what you think abstraction means in this context and how it would improve our understanding of complex systems?

Also, can you give an example of a complex system where abstraction has led to better understanding?

(Note: The questions are for clarification purposes, and I'm not questioning the correctness of the statement.)
