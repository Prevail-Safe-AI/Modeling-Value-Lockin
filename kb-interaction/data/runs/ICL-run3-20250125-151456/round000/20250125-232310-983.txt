==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into it!

I've chosen the item:
```
{
  "id": 61,
  "statement": "Subjective knowledge in Bayesian modeling is informed expertise and judgment."
}
```

And I must admit, I'm least confident about the notion that "subjective knowledge in Bayesian modeling is informed expertise and judgment".

Can you elaborate on why you think this statement is true? What do you mean by "informed expertise and judgment"? How does this relate to Bayesian modeling?
