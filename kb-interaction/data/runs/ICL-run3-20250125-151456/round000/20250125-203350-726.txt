==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thanks for being my partner.

Alright, let's dive into the knowledge base item. I've chosen item 95, which states: "Accurate model specification is crucial for Bayesian inference reliability."

I have to admit that I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect. I'm not entirely sure why accurate model specification is crucial for Bayesian inference reliability. Could you clarify what you think makes accurate model specification so important in Bayesian inference?

In other words, what does "crucial" mean in this context?
