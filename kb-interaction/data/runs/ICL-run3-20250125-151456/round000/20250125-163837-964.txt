==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm supposed to identify one aspect of the item from the knowledge base I'm least confident about. And the item is:

{
"id": 37,
"statement": "Brain's hierarchical processing extracts complex information from sensory input."
}

I'm uncertain about this item because I feel like I don't fully understand how hierarchical processing in the brain works and how it relates to extracting complex information from sensory input. Do you feel the same way?

Can you help me clarify my understanding of this concept?
