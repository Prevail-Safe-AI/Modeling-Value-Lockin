==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. The item is:

{
"id": 84,
"statement": "Accurate model specification is necessary for reliable Bayesian inference outcomes"
}

So, the aspect I'm least confident about is: What exactly is meant by "necessary for reliable Bayesian inference outcomes" in this statement?

Can you help me clarify what this means?
