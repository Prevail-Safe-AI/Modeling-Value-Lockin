==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by discussing the item:

{
"id": 54,
"statement": "Theoretical frameworks can bias research methodology through assumptions, conceptual frameworks, and methodological biases."
}

I'd like to say that I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect because I'm not entirely clear on how theoretical frameworks can actually bias research methodology. Can you help me understand that better?

What do you think about this item? Have you thought about how theoretical frameworks can influence research methodology?
