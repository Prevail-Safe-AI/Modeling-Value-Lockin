I'd like to check my understanding. Things I'm Uncertain About This Item:

* I'm uncertain about what "prior biases" refer to in this context. Are they biases that we have before knowing the truth or some sort of underlying assumption?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what you mean by "prior biases" in this statement? Are they inherent biases or biases we develop based on our past experiences?
