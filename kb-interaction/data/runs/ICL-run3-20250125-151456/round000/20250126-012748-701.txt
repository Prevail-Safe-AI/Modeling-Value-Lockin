==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's focus on the item: "Mathematical frameworks should explicitly acknowledge assumptions and limitations, explicitly."

I'm least confident about the aspect that specifically requires mathematical frameworks to acknowledge limitations and assumptions "explicitly". I'd like to know more about what this means and why it's important.

Can you help me understand what you mean by "explicitly"? Does it mean that the assumptions and limitations should be written out in a clear and concise manner, easy to understand for anyone looking at the framework? Or is there something more to it?

Also, what do you think the consequences would be if a mathematical framework didn't explicitly acknowledge its limitations and assumptions? How would that impact the validity or reliability of the framework?
