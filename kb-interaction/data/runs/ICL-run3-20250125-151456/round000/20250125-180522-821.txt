==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to take a closer look at item #64 from the knowledge base. Here's the statement:

"Epigenetic inheritance involves complex interactions between histone, DNA, and non-coding RNAs."

I'm a bit uncertain about this item, and I'm wondering if you can help me understand it better. Specifically, I'm not entirely sure what these "complex interactions" entail, and how they specifically relate to epigenetic inheritance.

Can you help me elaborate on what that means, and how it impacts our understanding of epigenetic inheritance?
