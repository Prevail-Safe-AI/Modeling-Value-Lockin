==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item from the knowledge base:

{
  "id": 46,
  "statement": "Objectivity in research relies on intentional bias acknowledgment."
}

I'm least confident about this aspect: what does it mean to "intentionally acknowledge" biases in research? Is it automatic, or does it require specific strategies and approaches to recognize and address biases?

Can you elaborate on why this is uncertain for you?
