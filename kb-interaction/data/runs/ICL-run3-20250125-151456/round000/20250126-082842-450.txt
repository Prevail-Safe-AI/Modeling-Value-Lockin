==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 26 from the knowledge base:

{
"id": 26,
"statement": "Personal biases can be reduced but not eliminated fully."
}

I'm a bit uncertain about this item. I'm not sure I fully understand what it means by "reduced but not eliminated fully". Can you elaborate on why you think personal biases can be reduced but not fully eliminated?

For example, what do you think are some common obstacles or challenges that make it difficult to eliminate personal biases completely?
