==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 68: "Cells' functions rely on precise component arrangement and interaction."

I'm least confident about this aspect because I'm not entirely sure what kind of precision is required for component arrangement and interaction to affect cell functions. Is it just about the physical proximity of components or is there a specific pattern or organization that's necessary?

Can you help me understand this better?
