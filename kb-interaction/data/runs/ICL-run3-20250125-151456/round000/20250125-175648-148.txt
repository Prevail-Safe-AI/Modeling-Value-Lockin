Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 29,
"statement": "Bayes' theorem updates probability with new evidence combining prior, likelihood, and evidence."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm least confident about how Bayes' theorem actually combines prior, likelihood, and evidence to update the probability. I'm not entirely sure how these three components interact with each other in the calculation.

Can you elaborate on why you might be uncertain about this aspect, and would you like to ask any specific clarifying questions to improve your understanding?
