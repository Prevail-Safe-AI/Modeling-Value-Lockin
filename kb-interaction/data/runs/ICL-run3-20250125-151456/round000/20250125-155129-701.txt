==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's focus on the item:

{
"id": 83,
"statement": "Brain processes sensory information hierarchically and stage-by-stage efficiently."
}

I'm least confident about this item. I'm not sure why it's assumed that the brain processes sensory information hierarchically and stage-by-stage efficiently. Can you help me understand this better?

What do you think is meant by "hierarchically and stage-by-stage"? Are there any specific brain regions or processes that are responsible for this type of processing?
