==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, we're going to discuss item 8 from the knowledge base:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 8,
"statement": "Brain's sensory processing involves hierarchical, distributed, and dynamic stages."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

I'm a bit uncertain about the phrase "hierarchical, distributed, and dynamic stages". I'm not entirely sure what it means or how these stages work together in sensory processing.

Can you elaborate on what you think this phrase is trying to convey? Specifically, how do hierarchical, distributed, and dynamic stages contribute to brain's sensory processing?

And also, what do you think the author meant by using these three adjectives to describe the stages?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you provide an example of how these stages might work together in a real-world scenario, such as recognizing an image or hearing a speech?

Please feel free to answer any or all of my questions!
