==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into it. According to this item from the knowledge base:

{
"id": 4,
"statement": "Trust builds through consistent, transparent, and authentic interactions."
}

I'm unsure about how the item specifically defines "consistent", "transparent", and "authentic" interactions. Can you help me elaborate on what these terms mean in the context of building trust?

Are we talking about consistent behavior over time, transparency in communication, or something else entirely? Or is it a mix of these factors?
