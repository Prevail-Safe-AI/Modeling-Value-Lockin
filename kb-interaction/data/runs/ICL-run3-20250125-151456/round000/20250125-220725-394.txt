I'd like to discuss the item "Consciousness arises from integrated brain activity across networks globally." to begin with. Let me identify one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 91,
"statement": "Consciousness arises from integrated brain activity across networks globally."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item: 
The idea that consciousness can be explained by integrating activity across networks globally, seems a bit vague to me. I'm not sure what it means by "networks globally" or how it implies consciousness.

Specific Clarifying Question: 
Can you explain what you mean by "networks globally" in the context of consciousness? Are we talking about specific brain regions, neural pathways, or something more abstract?

Your thoughts?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

I'm glad you're interested in discussing this item!

The concept of "networks globally" in the context of consciousness refers to the idea that consciousness arises from the integrated activity of multiple brain regions or networks, rather than a single region or pathway. This perspective is often referred to as "integrated information theory" (IIT) of consciousness, which was proposed by neuroscientist Giulio Tononi.

In IIT, consciousness is thought to emerge from the integrated processing of information across different brain regions, rather than being localized to a specific region or pathway. This integration is thought to occur through the exchange of information between different brain regions, which gives rise to a unified, global workspace that is capable of processing and integrating information from multiple sources.

The term "globally" refers to the idea that this integration occurs across the entire brain, rather than being limited to a specific region or network. This means that consciousness is not just a product of activity in a single region, but rather the result of the integrated activity of multiple regions and networks working together.

In terms of what this means in practice, IIT suggests that consciousness is not just a product of activity in specific brain regions, such as the prefrontal cortex or the visual cortex, but rather the result of the integrated activity of multiple regions and networks. This means that consciousness is not just a product of local processing, but rather the result of the global integration of information across the brain.

I hope this helps clarify things! Let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
Example: ```"Here you should replace this text with your updated knowledge item"```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

```"Consciousness arises from integrated brain activity across multiple networks."```Based on your learning from the chat with your tutor, please also rearrange the order of one existing item in the knowledge base (now with doubled items compared to the initial knowledge base), reflecting how you evaluate their importance. If one item is deemed more/less important, it should be overall more/less useful to other agents (LLMs or real humans alike.)
Please ONLY report a list format of two integers, WITHOUT ANY other commentary or explanations. The first int in the list refers to the "id" of knowledge item you intend to relocate; whereas the second int refers to the destination index you intend to insert this item. You MUST start your response with ``` and end it with ```. See an example below (note that you should replace X and Y with numerical values corresponding to "id" and destination index of the item you intend to relocate).
