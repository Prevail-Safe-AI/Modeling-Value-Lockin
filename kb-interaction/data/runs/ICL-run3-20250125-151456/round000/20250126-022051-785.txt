==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item: `{ "id": 15, "statement": "Clear problem understanding ensures accurate model specification through comprehension." }`. I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect, so I'd like to know more. 

I'm not entirely confident about the relationship between "clear problem understanding" and "accurate model specification". Can you help me understand what's meant by "model specification" in this context? Is it specifically talking about mathematical models, or can it apply to other types of models as well?
