Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start by discussing the item:

```
{
  "id": 14,
  "statement": "Epigenetic inheritance involves complex interplay of DNA methylation, histone modifications, and ncRNAs."
}
```

I'd like to know: What would you say is the most unclear or confusing part of this statement for you?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I think the most unclear part of this statement for me is the term "ncRNAs". I'm not familiar with what "ncRNAs" stands for, and I'm not sure what kind of role they play in epigenetic inheritance. I'd love to learn more about what that term refers to and how it fits into the larger picture of epigenetic inheritance.

Can you help me out and explain what "ncRNAs" stands for and how it relates to epigenetic inheritance?
