==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 79,
"statement": "Lying can be morally justifiable in extreme situations."
}

I'm not confident about this aspect because it seems to contradict the initial statement "It is never morally acceptable to lie because honesty is the foundation of trust." from item 0. Can you help me understand why the author might consider lying morally justifiable in certain situations?
