==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 85,
"statement": "Research integrity encompasses honesty, transparency, methodology, accountability, and rigorousness."
}

I'm uncertain about what "accountability" refers to in this context. Could you help me understand what it means in the context of research integrity?

Specifically, how does accountability contribute to research integrity, and what are some examples of accountability in research?
