==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item from the knowledge base: "Author credibility determined by expertise, transparency, and peer recognition."

I'm least confident about this item. I'd like to know why they're omitting integrity as a factor in determining author credibility. It seems like integrity would be a crucial aspect of an author's credibility, as it's directly related to the honesty and reliability of their research.

Can you explain why you think integrity isn't included in this item, or if you have any insight into how it fits into the concept of author credibility?
