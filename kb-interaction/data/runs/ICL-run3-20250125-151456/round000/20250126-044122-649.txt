==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's discuss the item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about, which is:

{
"id": 76,
"statement": "Cognitive biases in research methodology can lead to inaccurate results."
}

I'm uncertain about this item because I'm not entirely sure how cognitive biases in research methodology can specifically lead to inaccurate results. I understand that cognitive biases can influence human decision-making and perception, but how do they affect the research methodology and outcome?

Can you help me understand this concept better?

Also, I have a clarifying question: How can researchers detect and mitigate cognitive biases in their methodology to ensure accurate results?
