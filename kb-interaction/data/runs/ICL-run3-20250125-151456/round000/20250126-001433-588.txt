==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 17,
"statement": "Objectivity stems from self-awareness, empathy, and continuous learning"
}

To be honest, I'm a bit uncertain about this item. I think it's because I'm not entirely sure how "self-awareness", "empathy", and "continuous learning" relate to objectivity.

Could you help me understand why these three aspects are considered essential for objectivity?
