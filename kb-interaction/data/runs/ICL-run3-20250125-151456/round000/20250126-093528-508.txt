==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, let's discuss the item "Research integrity is harmony of honesty, transparency, and methodology" (id: 33).

I'm least confident about the concept of "harmony" in this statement. What do you think it means for honesty, transparency, and methodology to be "in harmony" in research integrity? Is it just a figure of speech, or is there something more specific behind that phrase?

Can you help me clarify what you think harmony means in this context?
