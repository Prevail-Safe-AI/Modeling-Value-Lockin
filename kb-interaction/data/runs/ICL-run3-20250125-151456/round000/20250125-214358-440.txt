==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the item "Cultural norms influence honesty judgments through socialization and context." I'm least confident about this aspect. 

I'm uncertain about how cultural norms exactly influence honesty judgments. Does it mean that cultural norms shape our moral compass and decision-making process, making us more inclined to be honest or dishonest depending on our cultural background?

Can you provide more insight or clarification on this aspect?
