==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with item 88. The statement says "Biases arise from intricate relationships between various factors." I'm not confident about this aspect because I'm not sure what the author meant by "intricate relationships" and how they relate to biases. Can you help me elaborate on this? What kind of relationships are we talking about?
