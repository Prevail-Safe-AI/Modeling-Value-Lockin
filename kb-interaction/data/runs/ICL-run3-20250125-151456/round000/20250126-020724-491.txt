==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I've chosen an item to discuss: `{ "id": 24, "statement": "Author credibility consists of expertise, reputation, and trustworthiness factors." }`. 

I'm least confident about this item because I'm not sure what "trustworthiness" refers to in this context. Is it related to the author's ability to maintain objectivity, or is it more related to their propensity to manipulate or exaggerate their claims?

Can you help me understand what "trustworthiness" means in this context?
