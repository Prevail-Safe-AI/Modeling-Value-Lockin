==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's explore the statement "Human dignity arises from interdependent biological, psychological, and cultural factors."

I'd like to identify one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the statement, I think I'm least confident about the phrase "interdependent biological, psychological, and cultural factors".

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not quite sure what is meant by "interdependent". How does one factor depend on the others, and how do they work together to contribute to human dignity? Are the biological, psychological, and cultural factors mutually influencing each other, or is there a specific hierarchical relationship between them?

Can you help me understand this aspect better?
