==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the knowledge base item:

{
"id": 64,
"statement": "Neural transmission involves harmonious electrical and chemical signals interaction."
}

I'm a bit uncertain about this item. Specifically, I'm unclear about what is meant by "harmonious" electrical and chemical signals interaction. To me, neural transmission seems like a complex process involving the transmission of electrical impulses, which is often described as a series of electrical events. However, I'm not sure how the chemical signals (like neurotransmitters and hormones) fit into this process in a harmonious way. Could you help clarify what this phrase means?

Do you think the item is trying to describe a specific mechanism or process, or is it more of a general principle?
