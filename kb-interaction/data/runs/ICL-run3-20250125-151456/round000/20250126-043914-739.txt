==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Based on the knowledge base, I'll identify one aspect that I'm least confident about. It's item 37: "Objectivity emerges from harmonious cooperation of honesty, transparency, and rigor."

I'm uncertain about this item because I'm not entirely sure what "harmonious cooperation" means in this context. I'm wondering if it implies a specific order or relationship between honesty, transparency, and rigor. Are they equal partners, or is one more important than the others?

Can you help me clarify what "harmonious cooperation" means in this item, and how it contributes to objectivity in research?
