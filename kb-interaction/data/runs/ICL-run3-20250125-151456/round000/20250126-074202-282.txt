==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's analyze the knowledge base item:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 62,
  "statement": "Unacknowledged assumptions can subtly influence research findings regardless context"
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm a bit uncertain about the phrase "regardless context". It's not entirely clear to me what is meant by "context" in this context (pun intended!). For example, does "context" refer to the research topic, the population being studied, the research design, or something else entirely?
