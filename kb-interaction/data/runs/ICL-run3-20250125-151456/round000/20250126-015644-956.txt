==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item: `{"id": 14, "statement": "Evaluating sources requires considering multiple credibility factors simultaneously."}`.

I'm a little uncertain about this item. I'd like to know more about what exactly these "multiple credibility factors" are. Are they specifically related to the source's author credentials, institution, peer review, methodology, research question, transparency, and reproducibility, as we've seen in other items? Or are there other factors that I'm not familiar with?

Can you help clarify what these credibility factors are and how they're considered when evaluating sources?
