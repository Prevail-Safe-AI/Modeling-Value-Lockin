Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 80,
"statement": "Unmeasured confounding occurs when an unknown variable affects research results"
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not entirely sure what "unmeasured confounding" means in the context of research. Can you explain what it is and how it could affect research results?

Also, I'd love to know more about why unmeasured confounding is a concern in research. What are some real-world examples of this concept in action?
