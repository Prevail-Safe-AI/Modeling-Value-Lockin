==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's focus on one item from the knowledge base. I'd like to discuss item #20: "Objectivity in research requires honesty, transparency, and rigorous methodology". 

I'm least confident about this item because I think it's a simple statement that has a straightforward meaning, but I'm not entirely sure what it means or how it applies in real-world research situations. Can you elaborate on why you think honesty, transparency, and rigorous methodology are necessary for objectivity in research?

(Master question: Why so confidence?)
