==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 92,
"statement": "Identifiability is crucial in Bayesian inference for unique parameter estimation."
}

I'm going to start by saying that I'm not very confident about this item. I'm not entirely sure why identifiability is crucial in Bayesian inference. Can you help me understand what's going on here?

What do you think is meant by "identifiability" in this context? And how does it relate to unique parameter estimation in Bayesian inference?
