==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've chosen the item to discuss, which is:

Item to Discuss:
{
  "id": 79,
  "statement": "Social norms influence cultural definitions of honesty through role modeling and normative expectations."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm least confident about the relationship between social norms and cultural definitions of honesty. I'm not sure what specific role modeling and normative expectations play in shaping these definitions.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you explain how role modeling specifically influences cultural definitions of honesty, and what kind of normative expectations are involved in this process?

Please share your thoughts!
