==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you!

I'd like to discuss Item 10: "Research integrity relies on harmonious synergy of honesty, transparency, methodology". I'm least confident about this aspect because I'm not quite sure what "harmonious synergy" means in this context.

Can you explain to me what you think "harmonious synergy" means in terms of research integrity?

Also, I'd love to know how you interpret this statement and whether you think it's a crucial component of research integrity.

Specifically, I'd like to ask a clarifying question: What does "harmonious synergy" mean in practice? How do honesty, transparency, and methodology need to work together to ensure research integrity?

Please share your thoughts!
