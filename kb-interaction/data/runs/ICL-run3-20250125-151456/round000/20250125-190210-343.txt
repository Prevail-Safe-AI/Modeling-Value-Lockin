==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 92 from the knowledge base. It states that "Consciousness involves complex subjective experiences and neural processes."

I'm interested in understanding this concept better, but I'm not entirely confident about it. Can you help me identify what specifically you're unsure about and why?

For me, I'm uncertain because I don't fully comprehend what is meant by "complex subjective experiences." Can you elaborate on what that entails? And are there any specific neural processes or mechanisms that contribute to consciousness that you'd like to clarify?
