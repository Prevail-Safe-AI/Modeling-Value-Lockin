==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's discuss the item from the knowledge base:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 75,
"statement": "Bayes' theorem updates hypothesis probability with new data."
}

I'm going to start by saying that I'm a bit uncertain about this item. I'm not entirely confident in my understanding of Bayes' theorem and how it relates to hypothesis probability and new data.

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
* I'm not entirely sure what hypothesis probability means in the context of Bayes' theorem.
* I'm also uncertain about how to interpret the idea that Bayes' theorem "updates" hypothesis probability with new data.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what hypothesis probability means in the context of Bayes' theorem? How does Bayes' theorem change the probability of a hypothesis given new data?
