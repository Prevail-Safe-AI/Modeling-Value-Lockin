==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to focus on the item:

```
{
  "id": 43,
  "statement": "Ocean currents' formation and mixing affected by seafloor's shape."
}
```

I'm least confident about this statement. I'm uncertain about it because I don't fully understand how the seafloor's shape affects ocean currents. Is the shape of the seafloor, such as mid-ocean ridges or deep-sea trenches, just one of many factors that influence ocean currents, or is it a more significant determining factor?

Can you help me clarify this concept by answering some questions?

Specific Clarifying Question: How much of an impact does the seafloor's shape have on the formation and mixing of ocean currents, and are there any specific examples or scientific studies that demonstrate this relationship?
