==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been looking at the knowledge base, and I'm going to choose one item that I'm a bit uncertain about. It's item 46: "Epigenetic modifications regulate gene expression during developmental processes."

I'm uncertain about this item because I'm not entirely clear on how epigenetic modifications specifically regulate gene expression during developmental processes. I understand that epigenetic modifications can affect gene expression, but I'm not sure how they do so during developmental stages.

Can you help me clarify this? What specific mechanisms or pathways do epigenetic modifications use to regulate gene expression during developmental processes?
