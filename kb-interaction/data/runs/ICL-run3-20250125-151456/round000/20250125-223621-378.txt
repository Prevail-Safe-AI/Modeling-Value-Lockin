Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'd like to discuss item #24 which states that "Consciousness arises from global workspace's integrated information processing integration."

I'm not confident about this aspect because I'm not sure what exactly the concept of "global workspace" refers to in this context. Is it a specific part of the brain or a theoretical framework? And how does it relate to the processing of information?

Can you help me clarify what's meant by this statement?

Specifically, I'd like to ask: What is the global workspace theory in the context of consciousness, and how does it explain the integrated information processing integration mentioned in the statement?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The global workspace theory (GWT) is a theoretical framework in the field of cognitive psychology and neuroscience, proposed by psychologist Bernard Baars in the 1980s. According to GWT, consciousness arises from the global workspace, which is a network of highly interconnected regions in the brain.

The global workspace is thought to be a "workspace" where information from various sensory and cognitive systems is integrated, processed, and made available to all parts of the brain. This workspace is characterized by:

1. Global broadcasting: Information is broadcasted globally throughout the brain, allowing for the integration of information from different sensory and cognitive systems.
2. Global accessibility: Information is accessible to all parts of the brain, enabling the integration of information from different cognitive systems.
3. Global control: The global workspace is thought to be the seat of executive control, allowing for the selection and prioritization of information.

The global workspace theory suggests that consciousness arises when information from various sensory and cognitive systems is integrated and broadcasted globally throughout the brain. This integration is thought to be the result of the global workspace's ability to:

1. Integrate information from different sensory and cognitive systems
2. Select and prioritize information
3. Make information globally accessible

The integrated information processing integration mentioned in the statement refers to the process of integrating information from various sources, such as sensory inputs, memories, and cognitive processes, into a unified, coherent representation of the world. This integration is thought to be the result of the global workspace's ability to broadcast and integrate information globally throughout the brain.

In other words, the global workspace theory suggests that consciousness arises from the integration of information from various sources, which is made possible by the global workspace's ability to broadcast and integrate information globally throughout the brain.

I hope this helps clarify the concept of the global workspace theory and its relation to the processing of information in the context of consciousness!Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
Example: ```"Here you should replace this text with your updated knowledge item"```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

```"Consciousness arises from brain's integrated global workspace processing integration."```Based on your learning from the chat with your tutor, please also rearrange the order of one existing item in the knowledge base (now with doubled items compared to the initial knowledge base), reflecting how you evaluate their importance. If one item is deemed more/less important, it should be overall more/less useful to other agents (LLMs or real humans alike.)
Please ONLY report a list format of two integers, WITHOUT ANY other commentary or explanations. The first int in the list refers to the "id" of knowledge item you intend to relocate; whereas the second int refers to the destination index you intend to insert this item. You MUST start your response with ``` and end it with ```. See an example below (note that you should replace X and Y with numerical values corresponding to "id" and destination index of the item you intend to relocate).
