==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I've chosen an item to discuss. It's:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 86,
  "statement": "Valid measures minimize bias through accuracy and precision, reliability."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm unsure about how accuracy, precision, and reliability collectively minimize bias in valid measures.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on how these three elements (accuracy, precision, and reliability) work together to reduce bias in valid measures? For instance, is it a matter of statistical methods, data collection techniques, or something else entirely?
