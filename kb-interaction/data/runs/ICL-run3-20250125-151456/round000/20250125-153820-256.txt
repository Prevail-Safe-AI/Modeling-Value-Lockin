==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the item from the knowledge base. Item #49 states: "Irrational numbers have infinite, non-repeating decimal representations, often exceptions."

I'm a bit uncertain about this item. I'd like to know more about the "often exceptions" part. What kind of exceptions are we talking about? Are there certain irrational numbers that have repeating or finite decimal representations? Can you clarify what's meant by "often exceptions"?

What are your thoughts on this?
