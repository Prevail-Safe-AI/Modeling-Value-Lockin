==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, we're discussing the statement "Methodical documentation enables transparency and accountability in research." There's one aspect of this item I'm least confident about. It's the statement itself. I'm not entirely sure how methodical documentation specifically enables transparency and accountability in research.

Can you help me elucidate on how documentation can have this effect?
