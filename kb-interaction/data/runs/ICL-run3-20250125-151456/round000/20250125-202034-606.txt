==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item that I'm least confident about, which is:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 27,
"statement": "Consciousness arises from complex brain regions interacting globally"
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not entirely sure how complex brain regions interacting globally exactly leads to consciousness. I understand that Integrated Information Theory (IIT) proposes that consciousness arises from integrated information processing within the brain, but I'd like to clarify what exactly constitutes a "complex brain region" and how it interacts with other regions to give rise to consciousness.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what you mean by "complex brain regions" and provide an example of how these regions interact with each other to generate consciousness?
