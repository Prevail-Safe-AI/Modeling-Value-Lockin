==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Excited to dive in!

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 84,
  "statement": "Harmony between honesty, transparency, and methodology ensures objectivity."
}
```

I'll start by saying that I'm a bit uncertain about this item. I'm not sure how "harmony" between these three concepts actually ensures objectivity in research.

Things I'm Uncertain About This Item:

I'm not clear on what "harmony" means in this context. Is it simply the coexistence of honesty, transparency, and methodology? Or does it mean something more specific, like a balance or synergy between them?

Can you help me understand what the author meant by "harmony" in this statement?

Specific Clarifying Question:

What does the author mean by "harmony" in this context, and how does it specifically contribute to the achievement of objectivity in research?
