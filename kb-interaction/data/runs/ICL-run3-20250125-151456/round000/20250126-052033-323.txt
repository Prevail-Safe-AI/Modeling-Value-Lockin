==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

```
{
  "id": 15,
  "statement": "Methodology clarity is crucial for research reliability and generalizability."
}
```

Things I'm Uncertain About This Item:
I'm least confident about the implication that methodology clarity directly impacts research reliability and generalizability.

Specifically, I'm unsure about how methodology clarity contributes to research reliability. Is it because clear methodology allows for accurate replication, or is it because it enables researchers to identify potential biases and errors?

Can you help clarify this for me?
