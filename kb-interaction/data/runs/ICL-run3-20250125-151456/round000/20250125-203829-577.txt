==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item "Consciousness arises from integrated information processing in brain regions." This statement seems to be related to the concept of Integrated Information Theory (IIT) of consciousness.

I'm least confident about this aspect because I'm not entirely sure what "integrated information processing" means in this context. Can you elaborate on what this phrase means and how it relates to consciousness?

Also, are there any specific brain regions or processes where this integrated information processing is thought to occur?
