==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'd like to discuss item #6:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 6,
"statement": "Honey, transparency, and methodology are interconnected pillars of research integrity."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm unsure about how exactly these three elements are interconnected. Are there any specific examples or relationships between honesty, transparency, and methodology that make them pillars of research integrity?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you help me understand how these pillars support each other, and if there are any examples of how they work together to ensure research integrity?
