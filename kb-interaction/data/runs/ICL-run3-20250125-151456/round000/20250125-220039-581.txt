==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the statement: "Bayes' theorem updates probability with new data, not beliefs."

I'm not confident about this aspect because I'm unsure what exactly is meant by "new data" in this context. Is it referring to experimental results, observational data, or something else? Additionally, I'd like to clarify what is meant by "not beliefs". Are beliefs being considered as prior knowledge or assumptions that can influence the update of probability, or are beliefs being ignored altogether?

Can you help me understand this better?
