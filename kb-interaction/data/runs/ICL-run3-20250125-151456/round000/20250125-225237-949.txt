==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item from the knowledge base:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 22,
  "statement": "Honesty is necessary but not always sufficient for trust."
}
```

I'm least confident about the part where it says "not always sufficient for trust". I'm wondering why it's not always sufficient. Is it because there might be other factors that can contribute to trust, or is it because honesty alone might not guarantee trust in certain situations? Can you help me clarify this?

Uncertainty A: What does "not always sufficient" mean in this context?
