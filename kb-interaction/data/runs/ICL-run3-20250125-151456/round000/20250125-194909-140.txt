==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the item:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 98,
"statement": "Honesty's definition varies deeply rooted across cultures."
}

I'm curious to know:

What do you think "deeply rooted" means in this context? Does it imply that cultural differences in defining honesty are a result of long-standing cultural influences, historical events, or something else?

Please share your thoughts!
