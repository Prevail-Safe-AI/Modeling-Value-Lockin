==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into it. According to the knowledge base, the item states: "Clear scope, population, and context definitions ensure study relevance and generalizability".

I'm least confident about this aspect because I'm not entirely sure how defining clear scope, population, and context helps achieve study relevance and generalizability. Can you elaborate on why you think this is the case?

Also, what do you think is the underlying mechanism or principle that connects the definitions to relevance and generalizability?
