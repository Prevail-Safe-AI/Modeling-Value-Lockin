==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the item "Consciousness emerges from integrated information processing between regions".

I'm curious about the part "integrated information processing". Can you elaborate on what you think this means? How do you think information gets integrated across different brain regions to give rise to consciousness?
