==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's take a look at the knowledge base item:

{
  "id": 27,
  "statement": "Effective communication in research involves clarity, transparency, etc."
}

This statement seems straightforward, but what I'm unsure about is what "etc." refers to. Is it referring to other essential aspects of effective communication in research, or is it intentionally left vague? 

Can you elaborate why you think the author included "etc." in this statement?
