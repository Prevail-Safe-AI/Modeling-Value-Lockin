==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item:

{
"id": 64,
"statement": "Epigenetic modifications regulate gene expression without DNA sequence changes."
}

I'm going to identify one aspect of this item that I'm least confident about. It's the relationship between epigenetic modifications and DNA sequence changes. I'm unsure about how epigenetic modifications can regulate gene expression without actually changing the DNA sequence.

Can you elaborate on why you think epigenetic modifications can achieve this? What specific mechanisms do you think are involved?

And, if I'm being honest, what are some potential challenges or controversies associated with this idea that I might not be aware of?
