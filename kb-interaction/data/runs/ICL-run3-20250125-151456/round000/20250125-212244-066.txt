==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item. I've identified one aspect that I'm least confident about, and that is:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 92,
  "statement": "Integrated Information Theory (IIT) explains consciousness mathematically."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
**I'm uncertain about the claim that IIT explains consciousness mathematically.**

Specifically, I'm wondering how IIT can model and mathematically describe the complex and subjective experience of consciousness. It seems like a challenging task to capture the essence of consciousness using mathematical equations.

Can you help me understand this aspect better?
