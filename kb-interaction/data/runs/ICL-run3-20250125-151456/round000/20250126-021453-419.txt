==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start with the item: `{ "id": 75, "statement": "Trust establishment requires honesty, consistency, intent, and follow-through." }`

I'm uncertain about this aspect: The relationship between honesty and intent.

Elaborating, I'm not sure how intent fits into the equation. Is intent a requirement for trust establishment because it ensures that one's actions are deliberate and not just a mistake? Or is it something more nuanced, like it being a key component of one's character or identity?

Specifically, I'd like to clarify:

"Can you explain in what way intent is a necessary component of trust establishment, and how it differs from consistency and follow-through?"

Your thoughts?
