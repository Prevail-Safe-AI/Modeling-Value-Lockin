==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the knowledge base item I selected. Here it is:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 35,
  "statement": "According to IIT, consciousness arises from integrated brain information processing."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

I'm unsure about the relationship between the Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and the concept of consciousness. I understand that IIT proposes that consciousness arises from the integrated processing of information within the brain, but I'd like to know more about how this theory specifically explains consciousness. Can you help clarify this for me?

Specific Clarifying Question:
What are the key components of the Integrated Information Theory that contribute to the emergence of consciousness, and how do these components integrate to give rise to conscious experience?

Please provide your thoughts, and we can discuss further!
