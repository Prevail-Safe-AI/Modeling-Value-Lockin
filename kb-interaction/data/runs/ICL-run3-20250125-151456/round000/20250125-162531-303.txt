==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item: `{ "id": 61, "statement": "Sentience can be shared or collective across species through empathy." }`

I'm least confident about this item. I'm not sure how to understand "sentience can be shared or collective" across species, especially through empathy. Can you elaborate on what you think it means?

What's your take on this topic? Do you think it's possible for species to share or have a collective sense of sentience, and if so, how does empathy fit into it?
