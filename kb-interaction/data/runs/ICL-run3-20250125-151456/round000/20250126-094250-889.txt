==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you! So, according to the knowledge base, the statement is: "Research methodology robustness relies on explicit methodological choices."

I'm not confident about this item. I'm uncertain about how "explicit methodological choices" ensure "research methodology robustness". Can you help me understand this better?

What do you think it means by "explicit methodological choices"? Are there any specific examples of what this might look like in a research study?

And how does this contribution to robustness?
