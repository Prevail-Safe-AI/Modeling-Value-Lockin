==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'll start by identifying one aspect of this item I'm least confident about:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 28,
  "statement": "Domain knowledge influences Bayesian prior distribution specifications through expertise, assumptions, and prior experience."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm uncertain about how domain knowledge influences Bayesian prior distribution specifications. I'd love to know more about the specific ways expertise, assumptions, and prior experience come into play.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on how expertise, assumptions, and prior experience interact with each other to shape Bayesian prior distribution specifications in a particular domain? For example, how does someone's prior experience in a specific field influence their prior beliefs about a particular phenomenon or outcome?

Your thoughts?
