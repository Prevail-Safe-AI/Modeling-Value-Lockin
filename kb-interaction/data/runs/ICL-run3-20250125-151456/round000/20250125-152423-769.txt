==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into item 74 from the knowledge base. Here's the statement: "Determining plant toxicity involves research, observation, chemical analysis, and expert consultation."

I'm least confident about the aspect that "chemical analysis" is actually a key factor in determining plant toxicity. Can you elaborate on what you think about this? Why do you think chemical analysis is necessary, or is it not as important as the other factors mentioned?

Also, what kind of chemical analysis do you think would be involved in determining plant toxicity? Would it be something like chromatography, spectroscopy, or perhaps other techniques?
