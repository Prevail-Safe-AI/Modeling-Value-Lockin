==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm going to choose the item "Histone PTMs regulate chromatin structure and gene expression through biochemical processes." (Item 60)

I'm least confident about the phrase "biochemical processes". I'm wondering what kind of biochemical processes are involved in this regulation and how they work. Can you help me understand this better?

Please go ahead and elaborate on why you're uncertain about this aspect, and then formulate some specific clarifying questions you would ask a tutor to improve your understanding.
