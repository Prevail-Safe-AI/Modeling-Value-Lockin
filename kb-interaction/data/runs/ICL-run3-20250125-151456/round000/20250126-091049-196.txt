==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 28 from the knowledge base:

{
"id": 28,
"statement": "Clear scope statement outlines purpose, objectives, boundaries, and parameters clearly."
}

I'm least confident about this item because I'm not entirely sure what it means by "clear scope statement" and how it ensures that the purpose, objectives, boundaries, and parameters are outlined clearly. Can you help me understand this better?

Specifically, what kind of information does a scope statement typically include? And how do researchers ensure that it is clear and concise?
