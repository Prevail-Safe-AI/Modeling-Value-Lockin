==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's discuss item #31: "Epigenetic modifications regulate gene expression through chromatin structure and accessibility."

I'm least confident about the aspect: "Why is chromatin structure and accessibility crucial for epigenetic modifications to regulate gene expression?"

Can you elaborate on why you think chromatin structure and accessibility are important in this context?
