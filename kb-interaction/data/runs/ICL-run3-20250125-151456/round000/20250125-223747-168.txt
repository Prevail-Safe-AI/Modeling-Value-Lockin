==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by saying that our task is to discuss item 42: "Prior distribution quantifies uncertainty in probabilistic model". I'm least confident about this item. I'd like to discuss why I'm uncertain about it.

To be honest, I'm not entirely sure what "quantifies uncertainty" means in this context. Could you help me understand what it means to quantify uncertainty in a probabilistic model?
