==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Based on the knowledge base, I'm going to choose an item to discuss and elaborate my thoughts.

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 79,
  "statement": "Lying morally justifiable only in extreme life-or-death situations"
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm least confident about the idea that lying is morally justifiable only in extreme life-or-death situations. I'm unsure about what exactly constitutes an "extreme life-or-death situation".

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what types of situations would be considered "extreme" in this context, such as situations involving imminent harm to oneself or others, or would it include other types of life-or-death stakes?

Your thoughts?
