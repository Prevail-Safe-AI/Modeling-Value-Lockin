==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item from the knowledge base:

```
{
  "id": 89,
  "statement": "Context influences research integrity and validity through cultural, social, historical factors."
}
```

I'm least confident about this aspect. I'm not sure how to interpret the phrase "through cultural, social, historical factors". Can you elaborate on what you think this means? For example, how do these factors exactly influence research integrity and validity?

Please share your thoughts and help me clarify my understanding!
