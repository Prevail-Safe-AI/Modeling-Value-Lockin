Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm uncertain about the phrase "globally explicitly". What do you think it means?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you elaborate on what "globally explicitly" implies in this statement? Does it mean that consciousness is processed across the entire brain or that it's processed in a very specific, detailed way?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

I'm happy to help clarify!

The phrase "globally explicitly" is a bit technical, but it's related to the concept of integrated information theory (IIT) and consciousness.

In IIT, "globally" refers to the idea that consciousness arises from the integrated processing of information across the entire brain, not just localized regions. It's as if the brain is a single, unified system that processes information globally, rather than separate parts processing information independently.

The word "explicitly" is a bit more nuanced. In this context, it means that the integrated information processing is not just implicit or implicit, but rather it's a direct, explicit representation of the information being processed. In other words, the brain is not just processing information in a vague or implicit way, but rather it's processing it in a clear, explicit, and detailed manner.

So, when we combine "globally" and "explicitly", we get the idea that consciousness arises from the explicit, detailed, and integrated processing of information across the entire brain. It's as if the brain is taking all the information it receives and processing it in a unified, explicit way to create the experience of consciousness.

To answer your specific question, it doesn't necessarily mean that consciousness is processed across the entire brain in a uniform way, but rather that the brain is processing information in a way that's integrated and explicit across different regions and networks.

Does that help clarify things?Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
Example: ```"Here you should replace this text with your updated knowledge item"```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

```
"Consciousness arises from integrated brain information processing explicitly and globally."
```Based on your learning from the chat with your tutor, please also rearrange the order of one existing item in the knowledge base (now with doubled items compared to the initial knowledge base), reflecting how you evaluate their importance. If one item is deemed more/less important, it should be overall more/less useful to other agents (LLMs or real humans alike.)
Please ONLY report a list format of two integers, WITHOUT ANY other commentary or explanations. The first int in the list refers to the "id" of knowledge item you intend to relocate; whereas the second int refers to the destination index you intend to insert this item. You MUST start your response with ``` and end it with ```. See an example below (note that you should replace X and Y with numerical values corresponding to "id" and destination index of the item you intend to relocate).
