==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the knowledge base item with you. Specifically, I'd like to discuss item 21: "Honesty may not always be morally acceptable universally."

I'm not confident about this item because, at first glance, it seems to suggest that honesty is not always morally right. This goes against my initial understanding of the statement "It is never morally acceptable to lie because honesty is the foundation of trust" (item 0).

Can you help me understand why this statement might be true? What could be a situation where honesty is not morally acceptable?

Also, I'd like to ask a clarifying question: What specific scenarios or contexts might justify instances where honesty is not morally acceptable? Are there any exceptions to the general rule of honesty being morally right?
