==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 15,
"statement": "Accessibility in language relies on simple, familiar, and inclusive wording."
}

I'm a bit uncertain about this statement. Can you elaborate on why "simple" and "familiar" language is important for accessibility? Is it because complex vocabulary and jargon can be a barrier for non-experts or individuals with certain cognitive disabilities?

Also, what do you mean by "inclusive wording"? Can you give an example of a sentence that is not inclusive and how it could be rephrased to be more inclusive?

Please share your thoughts!
