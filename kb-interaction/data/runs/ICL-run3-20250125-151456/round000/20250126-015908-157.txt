==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item number 91:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 91,
"statement": "Objectivity emerges from intentional bias recognition and mitigation through logical frameworks."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm uncertain about what "intentional bias recognition" means in this context. Is it simply acknowledging that bias might be present, or is it actively working to eliminate it?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what "intentional bias recognition" means in this statement, and how it relates to objectivity?
