==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 56, which is: "Data quality ensures accuracy, completeness, consistency, and validity in research".

I'm uncertain about this aspect. I think I understand what data quality is, but I'm not entirely sure what "validity" means in this context. Could you elaborate on what you mean by "validity" in data quality? For example, what kind of errors would invalid data have?

Also, are there any specific techniques or methods that are commonly used to ensure data quality in research?

Thanks!
