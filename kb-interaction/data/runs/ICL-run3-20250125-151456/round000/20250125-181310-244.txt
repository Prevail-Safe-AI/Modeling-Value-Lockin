==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 14 from the knowledge base:

```
{
  "id": 14,
  "statement": "Integrated Information Theory proposes consciousness arises from causal interactions."
}
```

I'm least confident about this statement. I'm not entirely sure what "causal interactions" refers to in this context. Can you help clarify what is meant by this phrase?

What exactly are "causal interactions" in the context of Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and how do they relate to consciousness?

Also, can you provide more information about IIT and why it proposes that consciousness arises from these causal interactions?
