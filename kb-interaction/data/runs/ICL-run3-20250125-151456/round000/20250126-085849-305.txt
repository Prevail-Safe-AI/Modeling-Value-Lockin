==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by identifying one aspect of the item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. It's:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 4,
"statement": "Clear scope statement defines boundaries and parameters explicitly crucial research integrity."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not sure what it means by "explicitly crucial" in the statement. What does "explicitly" add to the meaning of the statement, and how does it relate to research integrity?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what "explicitly crucial" means in this context, and how it contributes to research integrity?
