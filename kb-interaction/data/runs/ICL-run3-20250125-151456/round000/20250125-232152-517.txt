==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's take a look at item 35:

{
"id": 35,
"statement": "Epigenetic modifications regulate gene expression by altering chromatin structure and binding."
}

I'm least confident about the accuracy of this statement. I'd like to know more about how epigenetic modifications exactly regulate gene expression through chromatin structure and binding.

Can you elaborate on this process? Specifically, what does it mean to "alter chromatin structure and binding"? How do these changes affect gene expression?
