==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 94 from the knowledge base. The statement is "Epigenetic inheritance affects gene expression through chromatin remodeling". I'm a bit uncertain about this item.

I'm unsure about the concept of chromatin remodeling and how it relates to epigenetic inheritance. Can you please elaborate on what chromatin remodeling means in the context of epigenetic inheritance and how it influences gene expression?

Can you help me understand it better?
