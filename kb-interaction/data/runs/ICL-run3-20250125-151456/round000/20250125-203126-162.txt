==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item that I'm least confident about, which is:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 91,
  "statement": "Integrated Information Theory proposes consciousness arises from brain information integration."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

I'm not entirely sure how Integrated Information Theory (IIT) explains the emergence of consciousness from brain information integration. I'd like to know more about the underlying mechanisms and how they relate to our everyday experiences of consciousness.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you provide a simplified analogy or example to help illustrate how IIT proposes consciousness arises from brain information integration?
