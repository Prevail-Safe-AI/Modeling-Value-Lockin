==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by identifying one aspect of the item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about, which is:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 17,
"statement": "Brain processes sensory information through hierarchical neural transmission and analysis."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
What exactly does "neural transmission" refer to in the context of brain processing sensory information?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on the concept of neural transmission in the sense of how information is transmitted from one neuron to another? Is it related to synapses, or is it a specific process within the neuron itself?
