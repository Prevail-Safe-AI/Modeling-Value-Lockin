==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's discuss the item:

{
"id": 69,
"statement": "Sentience is a unique subjective experience of consciousness."
}

I'm going to start by saying that I'm not very confident about this item. Honestly, I'm not entirely sure what "sentience" means or how it relates to consciousness.

Can you tell me more about what sentience is and how it's different from just being conscious?
