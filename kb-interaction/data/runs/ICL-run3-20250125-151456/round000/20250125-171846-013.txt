==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you!

Let's dive into this knowledge base. I'd like to discuss Item #7:

{
"id": 7,
"statement": "Consciousness, self-awareness, and sentience are interdependent mental processes."
}

I'm curious about this aspect of the item. I'm least confident about the idea that consciousness, self-awareness, and sentience are interdependent mental processes.

Could you elaborate on why you think this is true or false?
