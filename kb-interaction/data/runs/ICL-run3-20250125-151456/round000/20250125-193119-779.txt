==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss Item 19: "Honesty's definition varies across cultural, social, and historical contexts." I'm least confident about this item because I'm unsure how to define and understand the concept of "honesty" in different cultural, social, and historical contexts. It seems like a complex and context-dependent concept.

Can you elaborate on why you think honesty's definition varies across different contexts? What specific aspects of honesty might change or remain the same in different cultures, societies, and historical periods?

Also, I'd love to hear any personal experiences or examples that illustrate the variation in definitions of honesty across different contexts.
