==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying one aspect of the item that I'm least confident about. The item is:

{
"id": 59,
"statement": "Consciousness arises from integrating brain information globally."
}

I'm uncertain about the relationship between "integrating brain information globally" and consciousness. I'm not clear on what specifically is meant by "integrating brain information globally".

Can you help me understand this concept better?
