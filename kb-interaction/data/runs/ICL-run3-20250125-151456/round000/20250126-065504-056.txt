==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
  "id": 98,
  "statement": "Research integrity ensures honesty through transparency, accountability, and rigor."
}

I'm a bit uncertain about how well this item captures the concept of research integrity. Specifically, I'm not entirely clear on how transparency, accountability, and rigor intersect with honesty to ensure research integrity.

Could you help me understand this better?
