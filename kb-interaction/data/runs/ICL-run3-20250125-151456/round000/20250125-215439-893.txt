==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by discussing the item "Non-electrostatic forces stabilize nucleosome structure through hydrophobic interactions." (Id: 87).

I have to admit that I'm least confident about this item. I'm not sure what exactly non-electrostatic forces are, and how they contribute to stabilizing the nucleosome structure through hydrophobic interactions.

Can you elaborate on non-electrostatic forces and their role in the nucleosome structure? I'd appreciate any further clarification on this topic!
