==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item we're discussing:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 96,
"statement": "Consciousness arises from brain's integrated information processing"
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
* I'm not entirely sure what is meant by "brain's integrated information processing". Can you explain what that phrase means in simpler terms?

And a specific clarifying question:
What mechanisms within the brain are responsible for this "integrated information processing", and how do they contribute to the emergence of consciousness? 

Please feel free to provide any insights, clarify any doubts, and ask me any follow-up questions if needed!
