==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by discussing item 95 from the knowledge base:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 95,
  "statement": "Epigenetic modifications alter chromatin structure through histone modifications."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm a bit uncertain about how epigenetic modifications and histone modifications interact to alter chromatin structure.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on why epigenetic modifications specifically need histone modifications to alter chromatin structure? Is there a direct causal relationship between them, or is it more of a correlation?
