==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to explore the knowledge base item "Bayes' theorem accuracy relies on independence and identifiability assumptions." I'm the least confident about this item.

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
* How can we ensure that these assumptions are met in real-world applications of Bayes' theorem? Are there any practical methods to validate these assumptions?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you provide an example of a real-world scenario where the independence and identifiability assumptions of Bayes' theorem are challenging to meet, and how would you address these challenges?
