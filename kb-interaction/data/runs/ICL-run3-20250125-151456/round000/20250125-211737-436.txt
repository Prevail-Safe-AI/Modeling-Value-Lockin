==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by saying that I'm a bit uncertain about one aspect of this item from the knowledge base:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 89,
  "statement": "Accurate model specification ensures reliable Bayesian inference results."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
The assumption that accurate model specification alone is sufficient to ensure reliable Bayesian inference results. I'm not sure if this is always the case or if there are scenarios where other factors, like data quality or prior assumptions, also play a crucial role in achieving reliable results.

Could you elaborate on this point and help me understand why you might agree or disagree with this statement?
