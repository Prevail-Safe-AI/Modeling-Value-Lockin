==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. The item is:

```
{
  "id": 7,
  "statement": "Research integrity relies on harmony of honesty, transparency, methodology."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

I'm unsure about how the statement "harmony of honesty, transparency, methodology" relates to research integrity in general. I feel like there could be different ways to achieve research integrity, and I'm not entirely convinced that "harmony" is the key.

Specific Clarifying Question:

Can you help me understand what is meant by "harmony" in this context, and how it specifically contributes to research integrity? Is there a particular example or scenario where having "harmony" in these three areas would result in a better outcome, or is it more of a general guideline?
