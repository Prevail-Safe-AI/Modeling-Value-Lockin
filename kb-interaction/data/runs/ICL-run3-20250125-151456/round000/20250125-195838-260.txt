==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the statement "Item to Discuss: {
  "id": 99,
  "statement": "Bayes' theorem accuracy relies on multiple interdependent factors."
}".

Things I'm Uncertain About This Item:

* I'm not entirely clear on what is meant by "interdependent factors". Are these the assumptions made in the Bayesian model? If so, how do these assumptions relate to the accuracy of the theorem? Are there other factors that also contribute to the accuracy?

Specific Clarifying Questions:

* Can you provide an example of what you mean by "interdependent factors"? For instance, how do the assumptions made in the model affect the accuracy of the theorem?

Your thoughts?
