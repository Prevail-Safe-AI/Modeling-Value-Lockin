==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've picked one aspect from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about, which is:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 36,
"statement": "Rigor in research ensures thoroughness, precision, and consistency."
}

I'm uncertain about this item because... 

I'm not entirely sure what the author means by "rigor in research" and how it specifically contributes to thoroughness, precision, and consistency in research. I understand that rigor refers to the thoroughness and meticulousness of the research process, but how does it ensure these specific outcomes?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what the author means by "rigor in research" and provide some examples of how it specifically leads to thoroughness, precision, and consistency in research?
