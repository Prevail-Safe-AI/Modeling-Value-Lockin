==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item.

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 84,
  "statement": "Consciousness arises from integrated brain information processing globally explicitly."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm uncertain about the phrase "globally explicitly". What do you think it means?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you elaborate on what "globally explicitly" implies in this statement? Does it mean that consciousness is processed across the entire brain or that it's processed in a very specific, detailed way?
