==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm going to discuss the item:

```
{
  "id": 92,
  "statement": "Unconscious mental structures influence research design and analysis unintentionally"
}
```

I'm least confident about this item because I'm not entirely sure what "unconscious mental structures" refers to in the context of research design and analysis. Can you elaborate on what this term means and how it affects research unintentionally?

What are your thoughts on this item?
