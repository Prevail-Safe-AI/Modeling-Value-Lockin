==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 63,
"statement": "Emotional regulation involves dynamic interaction between systems."
}

I'd say that I'm least confident about this aspect. I'm uncertain about what specific systems are being referred to in this statement. Are we talking about brain regions, neural networks, cognitive processes, or something else entirely?

Can you help me understand what these systems are and how they interact to regulate emotions?
