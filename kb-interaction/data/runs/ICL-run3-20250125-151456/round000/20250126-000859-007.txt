==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into it.

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 73,
"statement": "Honesty and trust belong in complex social networks."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item: I'm least confident about the sense in which "belong" is used here. What does "belong" mean in this context? Is it saying that honesty and trust are essential components of complex social networks, or is it saying that they are somehow naturally fitted into the structure of these networks?

Specific Clarifying Question: Can you help me understand what is meant by "belong" in this statement?
