==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 37 from the knowledge base:

{
"id": 37,
"statement": "Accurate model specification is crucial in Bayesian inference to ensure reliable results."
}

I'm least confident about this statement. I'm unsure why accurate model specification is crucial in Bayesian inference and what exactly it means for accurate model specification to ensure reliable results.

Can you help me understand this concept better?
