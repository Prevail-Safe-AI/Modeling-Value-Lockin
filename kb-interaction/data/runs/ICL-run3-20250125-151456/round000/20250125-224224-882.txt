==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

`{ "id": 97, "statement": "Honesty is not a sole foundation of trust universally." }`

I'm feeling uncertain about this item. Can you help me understand what the statement is trying to convey?

Specifically, what does "a sole foundation of trust" mean in this context? Is the statement suggesting that honesty is not enough to establish trust in all situations?
