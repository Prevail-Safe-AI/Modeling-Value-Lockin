==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've taken a look at the knowledge base, and I'd like to discuss item #63: "Harmony in research integrity combines honesty, transparency, and methodology." I'm least confident about this item because I'm not entirely sure what it means by "harmony" in this context.

Can you elaborate on what the term "harmony" is supposed to convey here? Is it referring to the coexistence of honesty, transparency, and methodology in research, or something more complex like the way these three components interact and support each other?
