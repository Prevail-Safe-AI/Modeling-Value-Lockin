==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base! I'd like to start by identifying one aspect of this item that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the item, I'm going to choose:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 94,
  "statement": "Careful methodology design ensures objectivity through transparent documentation."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm uncertain about the relationship between "careful methodology design" and "transparent documentation". How does a well-designed methodology ensure objectivity when it's accompanied by transparent documentation? In other words, what specific aspects of methodology design or documentation make an impact on objectivity?

Can you help me clarify this?
