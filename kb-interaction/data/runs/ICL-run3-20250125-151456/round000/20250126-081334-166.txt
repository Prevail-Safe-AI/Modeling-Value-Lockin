==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with Item 67: "Harmonious synergy ensures integrity through interdependent honesty, transparency, methodology."

I'm least confident about this item. I'm unsure about the concept of "harmonious synergy" in this context. Can you help me understand what is meant by "harmonious synergy" in relation to research integrity?

Specifically, what do we mean by "interdependent" honesty, transparency, and methodology? How do these three components rely on each other to ensure research integrity?
