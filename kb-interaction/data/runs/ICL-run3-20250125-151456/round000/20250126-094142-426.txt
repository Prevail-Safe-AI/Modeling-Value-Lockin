==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's get started with the item: `{ "id": 61, "statement": "Research generalizability requires reliability, validity, and contextual adaptability." }`

I'm least confident about "what is meant by contextual adaptability" in this statement. Can you elaborate on what it means by "contextual adaptability" and how it relates to research generalizability?

What are your thoughts on this?
