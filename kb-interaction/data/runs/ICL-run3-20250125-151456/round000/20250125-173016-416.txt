==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's discuss the item from the knowledge base: 

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 10,
"statement": "ncRNAs regulate gene expression through chromatin structural changes."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm unsure about how ncRNAs (non-coding RNAs) exactly regulate gene expression through chromatin structural changes.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you elaborate on what kind of "chromatin structural changes" are being referred to? Are these changes on the DNA itself or on the histone proteins? How do these changes specifically influence gene expression?
