==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 80,
"statement": "Model specification influences research understanding reciprocally, refining both iteratively."
}

I'm least confident about this item. I'm not sure what it means by "reciprocally" and "refining both iteratively". Could you elaborate on those terms and how they relate to model specification and research understanding?

Also, could you give an example of how this process might work in practice?
