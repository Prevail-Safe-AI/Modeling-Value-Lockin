==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 98,
"statement": "Honesty is not solely determined by conscious awareness."
}

I'm least confident about this item. I'm not sure why, but it seems to me that conscious awareness plays a crucial role in honesty, don't you think?

Can you elaborate on why you think honesty is not solely determined by conscious awareness? What would you say is an alternative or additional factor that influences honesty?

And, if you don't mind me asking, what specific assumptions or ideas are you relying on when making this claim?
