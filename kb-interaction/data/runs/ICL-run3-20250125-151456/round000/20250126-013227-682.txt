==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you!

So, I'd like to discuss item 63:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 63,
"statement": "Honesty is a foundational principle for trust and relationships."
}

Things I'm Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not entirely sure about the scope of "foundational principle". How would you define or elaborate on what it means for something to be a "foundational principle" in this context?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you give me an example of how honesty is a foundational principle in trust and relationships, and how it differs from just being an important value or principle?

What are your thoughts?
