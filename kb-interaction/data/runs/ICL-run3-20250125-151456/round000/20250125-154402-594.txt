==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item: {

"id": 87,
"statement": "Brain's hierarchical processing prioritizes essential information first."
}

I'm not very confident in this aspect of the knowledge base. What I'm uncertain about is the concept of "prioritizing essential information first" in brain's hierarchical processing. Is this referring to the brain's ability to filter out irrelevant information or to focus on the most important information in a given situation?
