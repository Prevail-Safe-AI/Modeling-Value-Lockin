==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've chosen an item to discuss from the knowledge base. It's item 49, which states:

"Histone modifications regulate chromatin structure and gene expression through interactions."

Things I'm Uncertain About This Item:

* I'm not entirely sure what "histone modifications" refer to. Could you elaborate on what these modifications are?

Specific Clarifying Question:
* Can you provide an example of what these interactions look like, and how they affect chromatin structure and gene expression?
