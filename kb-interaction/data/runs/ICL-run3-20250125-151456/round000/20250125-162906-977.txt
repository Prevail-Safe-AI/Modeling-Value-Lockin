==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item I'm least confident about, which is:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 44,
  "statement": "Prior biases can compromise Bayesian inference's reliability and conclusions."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not entirely sure how exactly prior biases can compromise the reliability of Bayesian inference and its conclusions. I'm familiar with Bayesian inference and the concept of prior probabilities, but I'm not clear on how personal biases can influence the outcome.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you explain in more detail how prior biases can affect Bayesian inference, and what are some common examples of this happening in real-world applications?
