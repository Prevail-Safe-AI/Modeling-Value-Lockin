==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's discuss the knowledge base item we're focusing on. The item is:

{
"id": 72,
"statement": "Consciousness emerges from synchronized neural activity harmoniously."
}

I'm least confident about this item. I'd like to know more about what "harmoniously" means in this context. Can you elaborate on why the item mentions "harmoniously" specifically, and what exactly does it mean for neural activity to be "harmonious"?

Also, I'd like to clarify what kind of neural activity is meant here. Is it referring to specific types of neurons or brain regions, or is it more of a general concept?
