==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's take a look at the knowledge base item:

{
"id": 67,
"statement": "Bayes' theorem accommodates dependent variables through conditional probability."
}

I'm least confident about this item because I'm not entirely sure what it means by "accommodates dependent variables". Can you help me clarify what this is trying to say?

Specifically, what does "dependent variables" refer to in this context?

Please feel free to explain or provide more context, and I'll do the same!
