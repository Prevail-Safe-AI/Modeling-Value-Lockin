==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's discuss Item 33 from the knowledge base. Specifically, the statement "Integrated Information Theory quantifies consciousness as integrated brain activity."

I'm not confident about this aspect. I'd like to know more about what "quantifies" means in this context. How does Integrated Information Theory actually measure or calculate consciousness?

Can you help me understand this better?
