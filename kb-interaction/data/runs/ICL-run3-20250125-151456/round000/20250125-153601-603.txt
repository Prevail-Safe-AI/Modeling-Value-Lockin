==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 94,
"statement": "Brain combines sensory features into coherent, unified perception."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm least confident about how this statement relates to the process of sensory processing in the brain. In particular, I'm wondering how the brain combines sensory features into a coherent, unified perception.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain to me what you mean by "sensory features" in this context, and how the brain integrates these features to form a unified perception?
