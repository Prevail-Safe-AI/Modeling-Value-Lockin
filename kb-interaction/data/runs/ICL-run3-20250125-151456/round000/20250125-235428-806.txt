==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss this specific item from the knowledge base:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 81,
"statement": "Cognitive biases can significantly impact prior distribution specification."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not entirely sure about the extent to which cognitive biases can affect prior distribution specification. I understand that cognitive biases can influence our decision-making and behavior, but I'm not clear on how this translates to prior distribution specification in Bayesian inference.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what you mean by "prior distribution specification" and how cognitive biases can impact it? What are some examples of cognitive biases that could affect this process?
