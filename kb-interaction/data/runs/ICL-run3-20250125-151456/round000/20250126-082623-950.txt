==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by saying that I've been tasked with identifying one aspect of this knowledge base that I'm least confident about, and one of the items that caught my attention is:

{
"id": 93,
"statement": "Research context influences generalizability through cultural, demographic factors."
}

I'm not entirely sure what this means or how it applies to research integrity. Can you help me understand this statement better?

What's the logic behind saying that cultural and demographic factors influence generalizability in research? Are there specific examples where this has been a challenge in research studies?
