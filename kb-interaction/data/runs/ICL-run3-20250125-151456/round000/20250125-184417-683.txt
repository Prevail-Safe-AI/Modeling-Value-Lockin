==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thanks! I'd love to discuss this knowledge base item:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 80,
  "statement": "Epigenetic modifications influence gene expression without DNA sequence alteration."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm unsure about how epigenetic modifications can influence gene expression without altering the DNA sequence. I mean, isn't DNA sequence the blueprint for gene expression?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain how epigenetic modifications can achieve this without changing the underlying DNA sequence? For instance, are there specific mechanisms or factors involved that allow epigenetic modifications to override the sequence?
