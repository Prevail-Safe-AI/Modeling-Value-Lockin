==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've chosen an item from the knowledge base that I'd like to discuss. It's item 61: "Objectivity demands continuous self-awareness of personal biases and limitations."

I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect: "personal biases and limitations". Can you help me elaborate on what you think these personal biases and limitations refer to? Are they related to cognitive biases, emotional biases, or something else entirely?
