==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm going to discuss item 61 from the knowledge base. It states: "Research context is influenced by internal and external factors interacting". I'm a bit uncertain about this item. I'm not sure what exactly is meant by "internal" and "external" factors, and how they interact in the research context. Can you help clarify this for me?
