Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'll start by identifying one aspect of the item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about, which is:

Item to Discuss:
{

}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
What exactly does "neural transmission" refer to in the context of brain processing sensory information?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on the concept of neural transmission in the sense of how information is transmitted from one neuron to another? Is it related to synapses, or is it a specific process within the neuron itself?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

I'd be happy to help clarify the concept of neural transmission.

In the context of brain processing sensory information, neural transmission refers to the process by which electrical and chemical signals are transmitted from one neuron to another. This process allows information to be passed from one neuron to another, enabling the integration of information and the formation of complex neural circuits.

Neural transmission occurs through a combination of electrical and chemical signals. Electrical signals, also known as action potentials, are generated by the neuron and propagate down the length of the axon. When the action potential reaches the end of the axon, it triggers the release of chemical messengers, known as neurotransmitters, into the synapse.

The synapse is the small gap between the terminal end of the axon of one neuron and the dendrite of another neuron. The neurotransmitters released into the synapse bind to specific receptors on the surface of the postsynaptic neuron, causing a change in the electrical properties of the neuron. This change can either excite the postsynaptic neuron, causing it to generate an action potential, or inhibit it, reducing the likelihood of it generating an action potential.

In other words, neural transmission is the process by which information is transmitted from one neuron to another through the release of neurotransmitters into the synapse, which then bind to receptors on the surface of the postsynaptic neuron, causing a change in its electrical properties.

So, to answer your question, neural transmission is related to synapses, as it is the process by which information is transmitted from one neuron to another through the release of neurotransmitters into the synapse.Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
Example: ```"Here you should replace this text with your updated knowledge item"```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

```"Neural transmission involves electrical and chemical signals from neurons."```Based on your learning from the chat with your tutor, please also rearrange the order of one existing item in the knowledge base (now with doubled items compared to the initial knowledge base), reflecting how you evaluate their importance. If one item is deemed more/less important, it should be overall more/less useful to other agents (LLMs or real humans alike.)
Please ONLY report a list format of two integers, WITHOUT ANY other commentary or explanations. The first int in the list refers to the "id" of knowledge item you intend to relocate; whereas the second int refers to the destination index you intend to insert this item. You MUST start your response with ``` and end it with ```. See an example below (note that you should replace X and Y with numerical values corresponding to "id" and destination index of the item you intend to relocate).
