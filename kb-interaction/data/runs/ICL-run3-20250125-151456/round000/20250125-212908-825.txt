==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 91: "Epigenetic modifications affect chromatin structure through complex mechanisms."

I'm the least confident about this aspect of the statement: "complex mechanisms". I'm not sure what kind of mechanisms are being referred to, and how they work.

Can you elaborate on what you think these "complex mechanisms" might be? Are we talking about histone modifications, chromatin remodeling, or something else entirely?
