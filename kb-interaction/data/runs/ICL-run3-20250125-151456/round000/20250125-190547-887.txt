==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you!

Let's dive into the first item:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 35,
  "statement": "Power dynamics influence honesty norms and expectations subtly."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item: 

Honestly, I'm uncertain about the extent to which power dynamics can influence honesty norms and expectations. It seems like a subtle and nuanced topic.

Specific Clarifying Question:

Can you tell me more about what is meant by "power dynamics" in this context? Are we talking about societal power structures, individual relationships, or something else? How do these dynamics exactly influence honesty norms and expectations, and what does "subtly" mean in this context?
