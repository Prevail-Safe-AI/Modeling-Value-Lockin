==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item. I've been tasked to identify one aspect of this item that I'm least confident about.

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 19,
  "statement": "Mitosis ensures cell replacement, tissue homeostasis, and differentiation"
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

Honestly, I'm not entirely confident about the phrase "tissue homeostasis". What does it really mean in the context of cell biology and how does it relate to mitosis?

Can you help me understand this concept better?
