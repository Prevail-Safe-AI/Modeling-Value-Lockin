==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 25 from the knowledge base:

`{
  "id": 25,
  "statement": "Epigenetic changes result from complex interactions between multiple factors."
}`

I'm least confident about this aspect: "Epigenetic changes result from complex interactions between multiple factors."

I'm unsure about this aspect because I'm not entirely clear on what these "multiple factors" entail. Are they referring to genetic, environmental, and social factors, or is there something more specific going on? I'd love to know more about the nature of these interactions.

Can you help clarify this for me?

Specific Clarifying Question:
What do you understand by "multiple factors" in this context, and how do these factors interact to produce epigenetic changes?
