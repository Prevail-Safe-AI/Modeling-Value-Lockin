==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item. I've chosen one aspect to discuss, and it's the item:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
"id": 74,
"statement": "Moral values vary depending on context and culture."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not confident about how general this statement is. Is it saying that moral values vary depending on the specific culture or context, or is it saying that moral values are entirely relative and can change with every situation?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain how the concept of moral values varying depending on context and culture applies to our daily lives? For example, would this mean that moral values are different for someone in a specific profession or in a particular community?

Please feel free to clarify or expand on this item. I'm looking forward to your insight!
