Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's dive into the item: `{ "id": 50, "statement": "Social skills complexity refers to navigating complex social situations." }`. I'm curious to know what you think about this item. What aspect of this item are you least confident about?

(Note: I'll respond with the template format as requested)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Based on the knowledge base, I'd say that I'm least confident about the definition of "Social skills complexity" in this item. While it's clear that social skills complexity refers to navigating complex social situations, I'm not entirely sure what specific aspects of social situations make them "complex". Is it the number of people involved? The level of emotional intensity? The cultural or societal context? I'd like to know more about what constitutes a complex social situation to better understand this concept.
