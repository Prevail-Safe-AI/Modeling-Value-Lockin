==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item from the knowledge base:

```
{
  "id": 21,
  "statement": "Evolution may occur unequally among different organisms and viruses."
}
```

I'm least confident about this statement. I'm not sure why evolution might occur unequally among different organisms and viruses. Can you elaborate on this?

What do you mean by "unequally"? Are there specific circumstances or factors that might lead to unequal evolutionary outcomes?

Please share your thoughts, and I'll ask follow-up questions based on your response.
