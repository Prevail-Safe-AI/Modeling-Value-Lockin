==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'd like to discuss item #39: "Epigenetic modifications alter chromatin structure to regulate gene expression". Specifically, I'm less confident about this aspect of it.

I'm uncertain about how epigenetic modifications actually alter chromatin structure. I understand that chromatin structure affects gene expression, but I'm not clear on how epigenetic modifications specifically impact it. Are epigenetic modifications altering the histone modifications, chromatin remodeling, or something else entirely?

Can you help me clarify this?
