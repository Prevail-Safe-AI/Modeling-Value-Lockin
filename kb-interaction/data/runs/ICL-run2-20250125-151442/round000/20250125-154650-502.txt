==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you!

I'd like to discuss item 85, which states: "Newton's 3rd law nuanced in relativistic and quantum contexts." I'm least confident about this item.

I'm uncertain because I don't have a deep understanding of the nuances of Newton's 3rd law in these complex contexts. I'd like to know more about how the law is modified or applied differently in relativistic and quantum mechanics. I've always thought of Newton's 3rd law as a fundamental, universal principle, but I realize now that its applicability might be context-dependent.

Can you help me better understand this item? What are some key concepts or ideas that I should be aware of?

And, of course, I'd love to hear any specific clarifying questions you might have for a tutor to improve our understanding.
