==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the knowledge base item. I chose item #82, which states: "Logical soundness necessitates harmony among truth, validity, and consistency."

I'm not entirely confident about this item because it seems a bit too broad or vague to me. I'm not sure what exactly it means by "harmony" among truth, validity, and consistency. Is it saying that logical soundness requires these three concepts to be equal, or that they need to be in a specific relationship with each other?

Can you help me clarify this point? What do you think "harmony" means in this context?

(And feel free to ask me questions too!)
