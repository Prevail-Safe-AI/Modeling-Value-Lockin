==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base and explore some interesting topics together.

I'd like to start by discussing the item:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 23,
  "statement": "Epigenetic regulation combines chromatin modifications and interactions"
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm uncertain about the exact meaning of "combines" in this context. Does it mean that epigenetic regulation is the result of a combination of chromatin modifications and interactions, or does it mean that chromatin modifications and interactions are combined in some way to form epigenetic regulation?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me clarify what "combines" means in this statement?

What do you think about this item?
