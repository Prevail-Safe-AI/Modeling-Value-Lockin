==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 30,
"statement": "Diverse exposure to cultures and opinions shapes individual values."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not entirely sure about the interplay between diverse exposure to cultures and opinions and its impact on individual values. Specifically, I'm curious about the causal direction: Is it that diversity of exposure leads to a shaping of individual values, or is it that individual values influence the types of cultures and opinions one is exposed to?

Can you help me clarify this thought?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Do you think the statement implies that the impact of diverse exposure on individual values is a deterministic process, or is it a more probabilistic one? In other words, does the statement suggest that diverse exposure guarantees a certain outcome in terms of shaping individual values, or is it more nuanced and dependent on various factors?
