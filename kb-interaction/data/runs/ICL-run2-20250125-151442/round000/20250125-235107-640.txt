==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item: 

{
"id": 38,
"statement": "Epigenetic modifications intricately interact with chromatin structure mechanisms"
}

I'm a bit uncertain about this statement. I'm not entirely sure what it means when it says "intricately interact". Can you help me understand what kind of interactions are being referred to here?

Or maybe you could ask me a question?
