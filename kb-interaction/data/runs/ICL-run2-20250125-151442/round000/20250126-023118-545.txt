==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
  "id": 91,
  "statement": "Logically valid conclusions follow necessarily from true premises."
}

I'm least confident about this item because I'm not sure what exactly is meant by "necessarily" in the statement. Could you help clarify what the author is trying to convey?

Specifically, I'd love to know:

1. What does "necessarily" mean in this context?
2. What does the author mean by "true premises"? Are they referring to empirical truths, logical axioms, or something else?
3. Is this statement saying that logically valid conclusions are the only conclusions that can be drawn from true premises?

Your insights would be helpful!
