==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by discussing the item:

```
{
  "id": 16,
  "statement": "Logical coherence requires harmonious integration of validity, relevance, consistency, and context."
}
```

I'm least confident about how "context" contributes to logical coherence. What are your thoughts on this? Do you think context is a essential component of logical coherence, and if so, how does it play a role in the integration of validity, relevance, and consistency?
