==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 71,
  "statement": "Hydrophobic forces contribute to DNA stability through entropy minimization."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

I'm least confident about whether hydrophobic forces really contribute to DNA stability through entropy minimization. As far as I understand, hydrophobic forces are a type of non-covalent interaction that occurs between non-polar molecules, but I'm not quite sure how they would contribute to DNA stability specifically.

Specific Clarifying Question:

Can you help me understand how hydrophobic forces affect DNA stability and how entropy minimization plays a role in this process? Are there any specific mechanisms or experiments that demonstrate this relationship?

What are your thoughts on this topic?
