==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by discussing Item 16: "Moral principles adapt to formative context-dependent virtues."

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 16,
  "statement": "Moral principles adapt to formative context-dependent virtues."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not confident about the concept of "formative context-dependent virtues." I'm unsure how to interpret this phrase and how it relates to the idea of moral principles adapting to these virtues.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you please clarify what is meant by "formative context-dependent virtues" and how they influence moral principles, especially in relationships between honesty and trust-building?
