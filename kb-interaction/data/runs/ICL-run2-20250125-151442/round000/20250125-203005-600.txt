==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into it. I've chosen an item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about, which is:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 21,
  "statement": "Post-translational modifications regulate protein function through structural changes"
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not entirely sure about the relationship between post-translational modifications (PTMs) and protein function. Can you help me understand how PTMs regulate protein function through structural changes? For example, what specific structural changes occur, and how do these changes affect protein function?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on the specific types of structural changes that PTMs induce, and how these changes affect the protein's tertiary or quaternary structure?
