Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Thank you!

I'd like to know more about this item:

`{
"id": 98,
"statement": "Internal consistency is not enough for logical soundness coherence."
}`

To be honest, I'm a bit uncertain about what "logical soundness coherence" means in this context. Can you help me understand what's being implied here?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'd be happy to help clarify!

In this statement, "logical soundness coherence" refers to the idea that an argument or a set of statements is not only consistent with itself (i.e., internally consistent), but also makes sense and is reasonable in the context in which it is being presented.

In other words, internal consistency is a necessary condition for logical soundness, but it's not sufficient on its own. Internal consistency means that the statements or arguments don't contradict each other, but logical soundness also requires that the arguments are well-reasoned, relevant, and make sense in the context in which they are being presented.

For example, consider a statement that says "All humans are mortal" and "Socrates is human." These statements are internally consistent, but they are also logically sound because they make sense and are reasonable in the context of the discussion about human mortality.

On the other hand, consider a statement that says "All humans are mortal" and "Socrates is immortal." These statements are internally consistent, but they are not logically sound because they contradict each other and don't make sense in the context of the discussion about human mortality.

So, in summary, internal consistency is a necessary condition for logical soundness, but it's not sufficient on its own. Logical soundness also requires that the arguments are well-reasoned, relevant, and make sense in the context in which they are being presented.Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
