==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I think I'd like to start by discussing the item you're least confident about. Is it the one about genetic predisposition influencing reduced emotional empathy development?

If so, what specifically makes you uncertain about this item? Is it the relationship between genetics and emotional empathy, the direction of the influence (i.e., reduced empathy being influenced by genetics), or something else entirely?
