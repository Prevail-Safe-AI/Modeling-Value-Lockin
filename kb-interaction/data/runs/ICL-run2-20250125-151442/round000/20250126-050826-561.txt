==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 11,
"statement": "Logical soundness requires clear articulation of validity, consistency, relevance."
}

I'm least confident about the aspect that "clear articulation" is necessary for logical soundness. I'm uncertain about how "clear articulation" relates to logical soundness.

Can you elaborate on why you think "clear articulation" is important for logical soundness? What do you mean by "clear articulation" in this context?
