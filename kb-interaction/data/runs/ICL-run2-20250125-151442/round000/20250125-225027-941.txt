==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item:

{
"id": 74,
"statement": "Formal validity assesses logical structure, independent of premise truth."
}

I'm interested in knowing more about this item. Specifically, I'm curious about the statement "Formal validity assesses logical structure, independent of premise truth." I'm a bit uncertain about why it's said that formal validity assesses logical structure independently of premise truth.

Can you elaborate on this statement and why it's important?
