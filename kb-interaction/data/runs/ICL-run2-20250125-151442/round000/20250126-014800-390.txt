==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the topic. The item we're discussing is:

{
  "id": 45,
  "statement": "Self-awareness is necessary but insufficient for emotional regulation alone."
}

I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect. I'm wondering, can you elaborate on why you think self-awareness is insufficient for emotional regulation alone?

What do you think is missing from self-awareness for it to be effective in emotional regulation? Is it the lack of emotional regulation skills, or perhaps some other factor?
