==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by saying that I'm not confident about the statement "Lying can be morally justifiable in extreme national security cases." Can you elaborate on what you think it means by "extreme national security cases"? What kind of scenarios would fall under that category?

Additionally, what do you think are the moral implications of lying in such cases? Is it justifiable because it's for the greater good, or are there other ethical considerations at play?
