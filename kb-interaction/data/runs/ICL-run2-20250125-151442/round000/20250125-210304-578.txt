==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I've been assigned to discuss item 39: "Epigenetic influences on gene expression shape moral development."

Things I'm Uncertain About This Item:

* I'm not confident about the specific mechanism by which epigenetic influences shape moral development. I understand that epigenetics can affect gene expression, but I'm not sure how this translates to moral development.

Specific Clarifying Questions:

* Can you explain in more detail what is meant by "shape moral development"? How exactly do epigenetic influences impact morality?
* Are there specific epigenetic modifications (e.g., DNA methylation, histone modifications) that play a key role in moral development, or is it a broader concept that encompasses multiple epigenetic changes?

What are your thoughts on this item?
