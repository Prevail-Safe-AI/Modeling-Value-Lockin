==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item `{"id": 52, "statement": "Internalization involves complex interactions of biological, psychological, social, and cultural factors."}`. I'm least confident about this item.

Can you elaborate on why you think internalization involves complex interactions of these factors? What do you mean by "complex interactions"?

Also, I'd like to know more about what's meant by each of these factors: biological, psychological, social, and cultural. How do they contribute to internalization?
