==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item!

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 98,
"statement": "Logical soundness relies on multiple factors beyond accurate initial assumptions."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm uncertain about how this statement relates to the previous knowledge base items discussing logical soundness. It seems to introduce a new idea, whereas earlier items focused on accuracy and truth of premises. I'm curious about the connection between these concepts.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand how the concept of multiple factors beyond accurate initial assumptions contributes to logical soundness, and how it differs from the earlier focus on accuracy and truth of premises?

Your thoughts?
