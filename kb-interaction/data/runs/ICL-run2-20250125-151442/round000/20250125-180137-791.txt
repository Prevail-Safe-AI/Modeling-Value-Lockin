==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to identify an aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about, and then discuss it further.

After reviewing the knowledge base, I've chosen item 82:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 82,
  "statement": "Epigenetic modifications regulate chromatin structure and gene expression collaboratively."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

I'm unsure about the exact mechanisms by which epigenetic modifications regulate chromatin structure and gene expression. While I understand that epigenetic modifications can affect gene expression, I'd like to know more about how they interact with chromatin structure to achieve this regulation.

Specific Clarifying Question:

What specific ways do epigenetic modifications interact with chromatin structure to regulate gene expression? For example, do they influence chromatin looping, chromatin remodeling, or other mechanisms?

Can you help me clarify this aspect?
