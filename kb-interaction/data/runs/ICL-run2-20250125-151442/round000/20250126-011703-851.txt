==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's take the item we're discussing: "Empathy is a necessary condition for effective social interactions." (Item #79)

I'm a bit uncertain about this item. Can you elaborate on why you think empathy is a necessary condition for effective social interactions? What specific scenarios or examples would support this claim?

Also, what do you think about the idea that empathy might not always be a necessary condition for effective social interactions? Are there certain situations where empathy isn't required, or where it might even be a hindrance?
