==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm tasked with identifying one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the statements, I've chosen item 86:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 86,
"statement": "Emotional Intelligence is complex, diverse construct encompassing multiple components and dimensions."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not entirely sure what it means by "complex" and "diverse" when describing Emotional Intelligence. What are some of the specific components and dimensions that make it complex and diverse?

Can you help me clarify my understanding?
