==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 59,
"statement": "Logical soundness demands consistency, coherence, and logical connection."
}

I'm least confident about this aspect of logical soundness, specifically the phrase "logical connection". I'm wondering what is meant by "logical connection" in this context. Is it referring to the relationships between the premises and conclusions, or something else?

Can you help me understand what the author intends by "logical connection"?
