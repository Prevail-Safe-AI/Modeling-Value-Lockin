==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item: "Honesty is the foundation of trust and strong relationships". I'm unsure about this item, specifically I'm wondering why honesty is considered the foundation of trust and strong relationships.

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item: I'm unsure about the relationship between honesty and trust, and how it leads to strong relationships.

Specific Clarifying Question: Could you explain what you mean by "foundation" in this context? Is it that honesty is a necessary condition, a sufficient condition, or a combination of both, for building trust and strong relationships?
