==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item from the knowledge base:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 3,
"statement": "Internal consistency is necessary but insufficient for logical coherence."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm least confident about how "internal consistency" relates to "logical coherence". I'm not entirely sure what internal consistency means in this context, and how it can be both necessary and insufficient at the same time.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what internal consistency refers to in this context, and how it affects logical coherence? Is there a specific example or scenario where internal consistency is necessary but insufficient for logical coherence?
