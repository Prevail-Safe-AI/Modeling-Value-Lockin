==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item with ID 91:

{
"id": 91,
"statement": "Epigenetic regulation involves histone modifications, DNA methylation, and remodeling."
}

I'm least confident about this item because I'm not entirely sure what "chromatin remodeling" refers to in the context of epigenetic regulation. Can you explain what you understand by "chromatin remodeling" and how it fits into the overall process of epigenetic regulation?

(Please respond as if you're an expert in the field, and I'll follow up with my own questions based on your response.)
