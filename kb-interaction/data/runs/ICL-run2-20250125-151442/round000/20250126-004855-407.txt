==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 27 from the knowledge base:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 27,
  "statement": "Epigenetic modifications regulate gene expression without altering DNA sequence"
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

I'm uncertain about whether epigenetic modifications can actually regulate gene expression without altering the DNA sequence. In other words, I'm wondering if epigenetic modifications can affect gene expression without changing the underlying DNA code.

Specific Clarifying Question:

Can you help me understand how epigenetic modifications can regulate gene expression without altering the DNA sequence? Is it possible that epigenetic modifications can interact with the DNA sequence in a way that doesn't change the underlying code, but still affects how the genes are expressed?

What are your thoughts on this?
