==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 21 from the knowledge base. The statement is: "Logical soundness requires truth, validity, and consistency of arguments." I'm not really sure why I'm feeling uncertain about this item. Maybe it's because it seems like a basic principle of logical thinking, but I'm just not entirely convinced that it's as absolute as it sounds.

Can you help me understand what's going on here? Is there a situation where logical soundness could actually rely on something other than truth, validity, and consistency?
