==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the knowledge base item:

{
"id": 95,
"statement": "Honesty is a necessary but insufficient condition for trust."
}

I'm least confident about this item. I'm uncertain because I'm not sure what "necessary but insufficient" means in this context. Specifically, I'm wondering how honesty can be both necessary and insufficient for trust.

Can you help me understand this?
