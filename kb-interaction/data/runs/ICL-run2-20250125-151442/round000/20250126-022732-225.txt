Let's dive into this knowledge base item:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 3,
  "statement": "Logical coherence ensures soundness through consistency, validity, relevance, context, evidence, counterarguments, and logical fallacies detection."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not entirely confident about how "logical coherence ensures soundness". Can you help me understand what that means? What is the relationship between logical coherence and soundness?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you elaborate on what "soundness" refers to in this context? Is it related to the validity of the argument, or something else entirely?
