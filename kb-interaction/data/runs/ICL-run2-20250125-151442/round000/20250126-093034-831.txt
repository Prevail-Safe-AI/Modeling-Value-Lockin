Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

I'd like to discuss the statement from the knowledge base: `{ "id": 72, "statement": "Non-covalent \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking stabilizes DNA double helix nucleobases." }`

I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect: the relationship between the weak aromatic ring bonds and the stabilization of DNA double helix nucleobases. Can you help me understand better? What's the mechanism by which \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking stabilizes the DNA double helix nucleobases?

* The mechanism by which π-π stacking stabilizes the DNA double helix nucleobases

Specific Clarifying Question:
How do the weak aromatic ring bonds between π-π stacking contribute to the stabilization of the DNA double helix nucleobases, and what is the precise role of π-π stacking in maintaining the structure of the DNA double helix?Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations.
