==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the statement "Mathematical rigor combines precision, accuracy, and thoroughness" (Item 7). Specifically, I'm not very confident about this aspect. 

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
What does "combines" exactly mean in this context? Does it mean that precision, accuracy, and thoroughness are equally important, or does it mean that they need to be present in some way, but not necessarily in equal proportions? 

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what "combines" means in this context, and how these three aspects (precision, accuracy, and thoroughness) work together to achieve mathematical rigor?
