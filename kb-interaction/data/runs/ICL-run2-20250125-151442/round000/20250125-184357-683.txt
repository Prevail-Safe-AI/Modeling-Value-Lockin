==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the statement: "Logical soundness ensures validity, not truth or accuracy in arguments."

I'm not entirely confident about this item. I think I understand what logical soundness means, but I'm unsure how it relates to validity, truth, and accuracy in arguments. Can you elaborate on why you think logical soundness only ensures validity, not truth or accuracy?

And to improve my understanding, I'd love to ask a clarifying question: Can you provide an example of an argument that is logically sound but not necessarily true or accurate? How would you distinguish between validity, truth, and accuracy in that case?
