==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's discuss the item:

{
"id": 69,
"statement": "Moral principles vary according to cultural, social, and historical context."
}

I'm least confident about this aspect. I'm uncertain because... I'm not entirely sure how to reconcile the idea that moral principles can be both universally applicable and influenced by cultural, social, and historical context. It seems like two conflicting views. Can you help me clarify?

Specifically, I'd like to ask you: How do we distinguish between universal moral principles that are rooted in human nature versus those that are culturally relative?
