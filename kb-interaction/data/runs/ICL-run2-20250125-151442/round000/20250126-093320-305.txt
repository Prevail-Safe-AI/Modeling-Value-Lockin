==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, we're looking at item 4 from the knowledge base:

{
"id": 4,
"statement": "Empathy involves harmonious integration of cognitive, emotional, and social processes."
}

I'm a bit unclear about what's meant by "harmonious integration". Could you help me understand what that phrase is supposed to convey? Is it the combination of cognitive, emotional, and social processes happening simultaneously and in balance? Or is there something more complex going on here?
