==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 63, "PRECISE TERMINOLOGY ENSURES LOGICAL COHERENCE THROUGH CLARITY AND CONSISTENCY". I'm not confident about the relationship between precise terminology and logical coherence. Can you elaborate on why you think precise terminology is essential for logical coherence?

What do you mean by "clarity and consistency" in this context? How do they specifically contribute to logical coherence?
