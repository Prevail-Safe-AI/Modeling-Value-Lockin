==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss a specific item from the knowledge base. It's:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 92,
"statement": "Logical soundness demands consistent and non-contradictory premises."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

I'm least confident about how the concept of "consistent and non-contradictory premises" affects the overall logical soundness. I'm not entirely sure what makes something a consistent premise or how it's determined whether a premise is contradictory.

Specific Clarifying Question:

Can you explain how consistency and non-contradiction are defined in logical soundness, and how they relate to each other?
