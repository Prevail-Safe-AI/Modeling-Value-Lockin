==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss Item #40: "Epigenetic marks alter chromatin structure, affecting gene expression dynamically."

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 40,
  "statement": "Epigenetic marks alter chromatin structure, affecting gene expression dynamically."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm unsure about how epigenetic marks can alter chromatin structure and affect gene expression dynamically. Can you elaborate on what "dynamically" means in this context?

Specific Clarifying Question:
What are some examples of epigenetic marks that can alter chromatin structure to dynamically affect gene expression?
