==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 85 from the knowledge base:

{
"id": 85,
"statement": "Epigenetic modifications alter chromatin structure, affecting gene expression."
}

I'm not very confident about this aspect. I'm uncertain about how epigenetic modifications can alter chromatin structure, and what kind of effects that has on gene expression.

Can you elaborate on why you're not uncertain about this statement?
