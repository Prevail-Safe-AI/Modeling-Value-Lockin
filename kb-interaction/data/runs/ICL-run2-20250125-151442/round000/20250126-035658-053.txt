==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'd like to discuss Item 90:

{
"id": 90,
"statement": "Logical coherence requirements include consistency, soundness, and relevance."
}

I'm least confident about the term "Logical coherence". Can you elaborate on what you understand by this term?

Also, could you explain how these three elements (consistency, soundness, and relevance) intersect or interact with each other in the context of logical coherence?
