Let's start with the item from the knowledge base:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 62,
  "statement": "Epigenetic changes result from complex genetic-environmental interactions affecting expression."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not entirely confident about the phrase "complex genetic-environmental interactions". What does that mean exactly? For instance, how do genetic and environmental factors interact in epigenetic changes? Are there specific mechanisms or processes involved?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what is meant by "complex genetic-environmental interactions" in the context of epigenetic changes and expression?
