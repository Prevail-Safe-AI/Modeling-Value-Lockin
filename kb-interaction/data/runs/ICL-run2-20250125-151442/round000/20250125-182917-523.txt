==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by discussing item number 79 from the knowledge base. The statement is: "Bioinformatics combines computer science, biology, statistics, physics, engineering, and mathematics."

I'm least confident about this aspect: The inclusion of "physics, engineering" in the list of disciplines that bioinformatics combines.

I'm uncertain about this because my understanding of bioinformatics is that it mainly involves using computational tools and techniques to analyze biological data, and it seems to me that physics and engineering might be outside the scope of bioinformatics.

Could you help me understand why physics and engineering are included in the list?
