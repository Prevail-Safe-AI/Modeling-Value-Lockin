==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you! Since we're discussing the knowledge base item:

```
{
  "id": 71,
  "statement": "Moral absolutism may exist where moral values apply universally."
}
```

I'm interested in understanding what you think about this concept of moral absolutism. As the phrase suggests, moral absolutism implies that certain moral values hold true universally, without exceptions or variations. What are your thoughts on this idea?
