==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I've been asked to discuss item 92:

{
"id": 92,
"statement": "Epigenetics regulates gene expression through histone modifications and DNA methylation."
}

I'm least confident about this aspect: "Epigenetics regulates gene expression". I'm unsure about it because I don't fully grasp the concept of epigenetics and its relationship with gene expression.

Can you help me clarify or elaborate on this concept? What are histone modifications and DNA methylation, and how do they specifically contribute to regulating gene expression?

What are your thoughts on this?
