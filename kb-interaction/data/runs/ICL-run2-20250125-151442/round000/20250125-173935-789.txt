==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've chosen an item from the knowledge base that I'd like to discuss, and it's item 34: "Mathematical truths are universally valid and timeless."

I have to admit that I'm a bit uncertain about this statement. It seems too absolute, and I'm not sure if it's entirely accurate.

Things I'm uncertain about this item:

* How can we define "universally valid"? What kind of contexts would make a mathematical truth not universally valid?
* What does "timeless" even mean in this context? Is it saying that mathematical truths will never change or evolve?

Specific clarifying question:
Can you elaborate on what you mean by "universally valid" and "timeless" in the context of mathematical truths?

What are your thoughts on this statement?
