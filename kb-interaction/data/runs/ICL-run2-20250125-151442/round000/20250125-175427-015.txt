==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item. Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 33,
  "statement": "Mathematical truths embed cultural and historical contexts."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

I'm uncertain about how the statement "Mathematical truths embed cultural and historical contexts" might apply to mathematical concepts. I'm not sure how cultural and historical contexts can be embedded in mathematical truths, as I would have thought that mathematical truths are timeless and objective.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what the statement means by "embed cultural and historical contexts" in the context of mathematical truths? Are there specific examples of mathematical concepts that illustrate this idea?
