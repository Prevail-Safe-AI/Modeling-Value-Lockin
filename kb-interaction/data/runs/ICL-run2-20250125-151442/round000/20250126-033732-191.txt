==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. For this item:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 0,
"statement": "It is never morally acceptable to lie because honesty is the foundation of trust."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
Honestly, I'm not confident about whether the statement "honesty is the foundation of trust" is universally applicable or not. I'm unsure if there are any exceptions or extreme scenarios where lying might be morally justifiable.

Can you help clarify why you think this statement is always true? Are there any limitations or contextual considerations that come into play?
