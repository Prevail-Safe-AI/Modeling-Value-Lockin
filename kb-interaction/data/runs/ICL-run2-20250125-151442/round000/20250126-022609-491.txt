==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you!

I'd like to discuss the item:

```
{
  "id": 24,
  "statement": "Epigenetic regulation involves complex interplay of mechanisms controlling gene expression."
}
```

I'm least confident about this aspect:

"I'm not sure what constitutes a 'complex interplay of mechanisms' controlling gene expression. Can you elaborate on what specific mechanisms are involved and how they interact with each other to regulate gene expression?"

Can you help clarify this for me?
