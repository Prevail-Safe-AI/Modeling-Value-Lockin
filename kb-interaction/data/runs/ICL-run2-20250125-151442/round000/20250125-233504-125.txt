==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you! I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 2,
"statement": "Cultural values emerge from individual-social interaction dynamics."
}

I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect, specifically the phrase "individual-social interaction dynamics". 

What do you think is meant by this phrase? How do individuals and social interactions come together to shape cultural values?
