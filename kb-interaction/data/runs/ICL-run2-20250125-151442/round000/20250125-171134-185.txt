==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the knowledge base item I'm asked to discuss:

Item to Discuss:
{
  "id": 78,
  "statement": "Explicit assumptions are clearly stated in mathematical models or arguments."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

To be honest, I'm not confident about what exactly constitutes "clearly stated" assumptions in mathematical models or arguments. I'm wondering if it's a straightforward process where assumptions are explicitly listed, or if there's more subtlety involved.

Specific Clarifying Question:

Can you help me understand what constitutes "clearly stated" assumptions in mathematical models or arguments? For example, would it be acceptable to assume that assumptions are clearly stated if they're listed in a separate section of the document, or do they need to be explicitly mentioned within the mathematical derivations themselves?
