==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you! I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 98,
"statement": "Epigenetic marks modify chromatin structure influencing gene expression complexly"
}

I'm least confident about this aspect of epigenetics. I'm not entirely sure how epigenetic marks can modify chromatin structure and influence gene expression in such a complex manner.

Can you help me understand this concept better? Are epigenetic marks more than just simple on/off switches for gene expression?

What factors contribute to the complexity of epigenetic mark modifications on chromatin structure and gene expression?
