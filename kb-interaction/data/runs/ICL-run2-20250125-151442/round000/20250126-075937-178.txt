==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I've chosen an item that I'm a bit uncertain about. It's item 32:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 32,
  "statement": "Chromatin structure, epigenetic modifications, and gene expression are intricately connected."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not entirely sure what it means by "intricately connected". What does that entail exactly? Are they connected in a linear fashion, or is it more complex than that?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you provide some clarification on what it means by "intricately connected"? For example, are there specific interactions or processes between these three elements that make them closely linked?
