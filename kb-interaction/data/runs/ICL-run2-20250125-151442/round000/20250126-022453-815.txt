==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, we have this item from the knowledge base:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 66,
  "statement": "Non-coding RNAs influence epigenetic regulation through chromatin remodeling complexes."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not confident about the statement that non-coding RNAs influence epigenetic regulation through chromatin remodeling complexes. I'm unsure about the specific mechanisms by which non-coding RNAs impact epigenetic regulation, and how chromatin remodeling complexes come into play.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand the exact role of non-coding RNAs in epigenetic regulation, and how chromatin remodeling complexes facilitate or interact with this process?

What are your thoughts on this?
