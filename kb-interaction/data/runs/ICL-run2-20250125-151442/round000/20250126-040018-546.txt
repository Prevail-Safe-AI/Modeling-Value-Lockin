==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item we're supposed to discuss:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 98,
  "statement": "Logical coherence involves multiple factors beyond syntax, terminology, context, and pragmatics"
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

I'm a bit uncertain about the scope of the "multiple factors beyond" listed. Could you help me understand what kind of factors are being referred to here? For example, are we talking about cultural background, personal biases, etc.?

Specific Clarifying Question:
What specific examples or instances of "multiple factors beyond syntax, terminology, context, and pragmatics" can we identify that contribute to a concept being coherent in a logical sense?
