==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item from the knowledge base:

```
{
  "id": 93,
  "statement": "Mathematical truths are perceived and expressed within cultural contexts."
}
```

I'm least confident about this aspect, and I'd love to clarify it further.

Things I'm Uncertain About This Item:

* I'm unsure about how math truths can be perceived and expressed within cultural contexts. I've always thought of math as an objective, universal language, not influenced by cultural biases. Can you help me understand this perspective better?

Specific Clarifying Questions:

* What are some examples of how cultural contexts might affect our perception and expression of mathematical truths? Are there specific mathematical concepts or areas where cultural influences are more pronounced?
* How do you think this consideration of cultural context relates to the idea of mathematical rigor and objectivity?

What are your thoughts on this?
