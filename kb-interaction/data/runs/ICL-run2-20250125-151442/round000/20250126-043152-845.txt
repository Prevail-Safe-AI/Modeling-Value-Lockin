==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you! I'll start by asking about the item I'm least confident about, which is:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 48,
"statement": "Logical coherence involves consideration of both cognitive and situational factors."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm unsure about what exactly is meant by "cognitive" and "situational factors" in the context of logical coherence. Can you help me understand what these terms refer to in this context?

Specific Clarifying Question: Can you provide examples of what these factors might look like in practice? For instance, what constitutes a "cognitive factor" versus a "situational factor" in a logical argument?
