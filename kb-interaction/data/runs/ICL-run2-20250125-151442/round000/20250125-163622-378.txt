==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'd like to discuss item 64:

`{
  "id": 64,
  "statement": "Epigenetic modifications regulate chromatin structure by altering histone PTMs."
}`

To be honest, I'm not entirely confident about how epigenetic modifications regulate chromatin structure. Can you help me understand this better?

Specifically, what exactly are histone PTMs, and how do they relate to chromatin structure?
