==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd love to discuss the item:

{
"id": 84,
"statement": "Logical soundness demands relevance to ensure connected premises and conclusions."
}

I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect, and I'd love to get some clarification on it.

I'm not entirely confident about how "relevance" is related to "logical soundness". Can you help me understand what's meant by this statement? For example, what does "relevance" refer to in this context? Is it about ensuring that the premises are related to the conclusion in some way, or is it something else entirely?
