I am your partner. Please start the conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's start with the aspect of this item that I'm least confident about. Item 98 states: "Lying can be morally justifiable in extreme moral situations." I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not sure what constitutes an "extreme moral situation" where lying might be morally justifiable, and I'm also unsure about what kind of lying this item is referring to (e.g. a white lie, a deliberate deception, etc.).

Can you help me clarify this?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'd be happy to help you clarify this aspect.

The concept of "extreme moral situations" is often debated among ethicists and philosophers. In general, an extreme moral situation is one where the usual moral rules or principles are challenged, and a difficult decision needs to be made. This could include situations where:

1. There is a high risk of harm or injustice if a decision is not made.
2. The situation is unprecedented or novel, and there is no clear moral guidance.
3. The decision requires balancing competing moral values or principles.

In the context of lying, an extreme moral situation might be one where:

1. A person is forced to choose between lying to protect someone from harm or telling the truth and risking harm to that person.
2. A person is faced with a situation where lying is the only way to prevent a greater evil or injustice from occurring.
3. A person is forced to lie to maintain a moral principle or value, such as protecting a secret to maintain confidentiality.

As for the type of lying referred to, it's likely that this item is referring to a deliberate deception, rather than a white lie. A white lie is a small, harmless falsehood told to avoid hurting someone's feelings or to maintain social harmony. In contrast, a deliberate deception is a more serious form of lying that is intended to deceive or manipulate others.

It's important to note that even in extreme moral situations, lying is not always morally justifiable. The decision to lie should be carefully considered, and the potential consequences of lying should be weighed against the potential benefits. Ultimately, the morality of lying in extreme situations depends on the specific circumstances and the values and principles involved.

I hope this helps clarify things! Do you have any further questions or concerns?Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
