==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. Here it is:

{
"id": 89,
"statement": "Genetic makeup's expression influenced by complex environmental interactions."
}

I'm unsure about this statement because I'm not entirely clear about what "expression" means in the context of genetic makeup. Is it referring to the physical characteristics that are determined by the genes, or is it referring to something else?

Can you help me clarify this and provide more insight into this concept? 

Specific Clarifying Question:
* What exactly does "expression" mean in this context, and how does it relate to genetic makeup's influence by complex environmental interactions?
