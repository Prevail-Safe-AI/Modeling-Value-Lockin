I am your partner. Please start the conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

I've been assigned to discuss item 6 from the knowledge base:

{
"id": 6,
"statement": "Logical coherence combines internal structure, validity, and soundness in argumentation."
}

The aspect of this item that I'm least confident about is what it means by "internal structure". Can you help me understand what the authors mean by this term in the context of logical coherence?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'd be happy to help you understand what the authors mean by "internal structure" in the context of logical coherence.

In the context of logical coherence, "internal structure" refers to the organization and relationships between the components of an argument. It's the way the argument is constructed, including the relationships between the premises, conclusions, and supporting evidence.

Think of it like building a house. The internal structure of the house refers to the way the walls, floors, and roof are arranged, how the rooms are connected, and how the different parts of the house work together to create a functional and coherent whole.

Similarly, in an argument, the internal structure refers to how the different components (premises, conclusions, evidence, etc.) are arranged and connected to create a logical and coherent whole. This includes things like:

* The relationships between the premises and conclusions
* The way evidence is used to support the argument
* The logical flow of the argument
* The connections between different parts of the argument

A well-structured argument will have an internal structure that is clear, logical, and easy to follow. This means that the argument will have a clear and logical flow, with each part building on the previous one to create a cohesive and convincing whole.

In contrast, an argument with a poor internal structure may be confusing, disjointed, or difficult to follow. This can make it harder for the audience to understand the argument and may undermine the credibility of the argument.

I hope that helps clarify what the authors mean by "internal structure" in the context of logical coherence! Let me know if you have any other questions.Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
