==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by saying that I'm tasked with identifying one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. And the item I've chosen is:

{
"id": 10,
"statement": "Biases in research and personal perspectives must be acknowledged."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

I'm not entirely sure what the phrase "must be acknowledged" means in this context. Does it imply that biases are inherent and can't be completely eliminated, or is it suggesting that researchers should recognize and actively work to mitigate their biases?

Specific Clarifying Question:

Can you elaborate on what you mean by "acknowledged" in this statement? How do researchers actually acknowledge and address these biases in their research?

Your thoughts?
