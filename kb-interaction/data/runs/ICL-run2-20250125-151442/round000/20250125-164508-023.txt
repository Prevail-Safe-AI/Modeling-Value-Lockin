==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been assigned to discuss one aspect of this knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the statements, I've chosen the following item:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 73,
  "statement": "Epigenetic modifications regulate gene expression by altering chromatin structure."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not entirely sure how epigenetic modifications exactly work or what's meant by "altering chromatin structure". Could you explain it in simpler terms?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you give an example of how epigenetic modifications affect gene expression, and how does it relate to chromatin structure?
