==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start with the item you're asked to elaborate on, which is:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 23,
  "statement": "Emotional intelligence enhances resilience through adaptive coping strategies development"
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

Well, I'm least confident about how emotional intelligence exactly "enhances" resilience. Can you elaborate on what you think is meant by "enhances" in this context? Does it mean that emotional intelligence helps develop resilience, or that it increases the ability to cope with stressors, or something else entirely?
