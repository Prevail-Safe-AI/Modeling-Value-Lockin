==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item: `{ "id": 90, "statement": "Honesty's value influenced by practical context, relational norms." }`. I'm going to share that I'm least confident about this item. I'm unsure about how honesty's value is influenced by practical context and relational norms.

I'm uncertain about this item because I'm not clear about what kind of practical context can influence honesty's value. For example, what specific situations or circumstances would qualify as practical context? And what do we mean by relational norms? Are these norms established by societal expectations, power dynamics, or something else?

Can you help me clarify these points and provide more insight on this item?
