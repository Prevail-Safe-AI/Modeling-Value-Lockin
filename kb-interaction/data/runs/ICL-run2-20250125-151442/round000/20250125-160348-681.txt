==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been tasked with discussing a specific item from this knowledge base:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 91,
"statement": "Proof by contradiction: assumption leads to logical inconsistency, refutes initial statement."
}

I'm least confident about this item. 

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm unsure about the concept of proof by contradiction and how it relates to the assumption leading to logical inconsistency and refuting the initial statement. 

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain or provide an example that demonstrates how proof by contradiction works in practice, and how it refutes the initial statement?
