==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'm interested in understanding our least confident aspect about a specific item. After reviewing the knowledge base, I've identified the item:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 22,
  "statement": "Epigenetic regulation is control of gene expression without DNA alteration."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

Honestly, I'm a bit uncertain about the accuracy and scope of this statement. I'd like to know more about what "DNA alteration" entails in the context of epigenetic regulation. Are there specific types of DNA alterations that are excluded, or is the statement more broadly referring to any changes at the DNA level?

Specific Clarifying Question:

Can you clarify what is meant by "DNA alteration" in this context, and how it relates to the role of epigenetic regulation in controlling gene expression?

What are your thoughts?
