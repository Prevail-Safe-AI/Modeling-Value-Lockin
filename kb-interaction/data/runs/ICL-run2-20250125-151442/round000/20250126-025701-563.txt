==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by discussing the item:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 98,
  "statement": "Logical coherence ensures soundness through logical fallacies detection."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

I'm uncertain about how exactly logical coherence ensures soundness through logical fallacies detection. The statement seems to imply that detecting logical fallacies can guarantee the soundness of an argument. However, I'm not sure if that's a direct causal relationship.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand the relationship between logical coherence, soundness, and logical fallacies detection? Is there a strict correlation between detecting fallacies and ensuring soundness, or are there other factors at play?

What are your thoughts?
