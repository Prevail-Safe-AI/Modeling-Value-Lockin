==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the topic. I've chosen an item from the knowledge base that I'd like to discuss. It's:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 82,
  "statement": "Self-awareness and emotional regulation reciprocally influence each other's development"
}
```

I'm a bit uncertain about this statement. Specifically, I'm unsure about the phrase "reciprocally influence each other's development". Can you help me understand what this means in the context of self-awareness and emotional regulation?

Could you elaborate on why you think self-awareness and emotional regulation influence each other, and what exactly does "reciprocally" mean in this context?
