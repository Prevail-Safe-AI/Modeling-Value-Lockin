==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've chosen item #82 as the one I'm least confident about. It states: "Epigenetic marks dynamically alter chromatin structure gene expression."

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I don't fully understand how epigenetic marks dynamically alter chromatin structure and gene expression. I'm not sure what "dynamically" means in this context, and I'm not convinced that I understand the relationship between epigenetic marks, chromatin structure, and gene expression. Can you help me clarify this?

Specifically, I have two questions:

1. What does "dynamically" mean in this context? Does it imply a continuous, rapid alteration of chromatin structure and gene expression?
2. Can you provide an example of how epigenetic marks dynamically alter chromatin structure and gene expression? For instance, how would this process occur in a specific biological context?

I'd love to discuss this further and gain a better understanding of epigenetic regulation.
