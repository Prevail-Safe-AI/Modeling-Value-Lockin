==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thanks! I'd like to discuss the item:

Item to Discuss:
{
  "id": 3,
  "statement": "Mathematical rigor combines precision, accuracy, and thoroughness"
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm unsure about the intricacies of mathematical rigor and how these three components fit together.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you elaborate on what "thoroughness" specifically means in the context of mathematical rigor? How does it differ from precision and accuracy?

Your thoughts?
