==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, let's focus on the item:

{
"id": 48,
"statement": "Emotional Intelligence involves self-awareness, self-regulation, and intrinsic motivation"
}

I'm least confident about the aspect that it involves intrinsic motivation. I'm unsure about what "intrinsic motivation" exactly means in this context. Can you help me understand what you think it means and how it relates to emotional intelligence?
