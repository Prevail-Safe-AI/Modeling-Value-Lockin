==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, I've been going through this knowledge base, and I came across this item:

{
"id": 41,
"statement": "Logical coherence arises from harmonious interaction between validity, relevance, and consistency."
}

I'm least confident about this item. I'm not entirely sure what it means by "harmonious interaction" between validity, relevance, and consistency. Can you help me understand what's being said here?

Why do you think "harmonious interaction" is important for logical coherence?
