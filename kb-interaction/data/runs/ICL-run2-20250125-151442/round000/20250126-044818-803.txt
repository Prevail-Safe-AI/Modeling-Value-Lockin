==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, the item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about is:

```
{
  "id": 94,
  "statement": "Internal consistency and relevance are intertwined for logical coherence."
}
```

I'm unsure about what it means by "interwoven". How do internal consistency and relevance relate to each other in the context of logical coherence? Should we prioritize one over the other? What are some examples of when this intertwining occurs?

Can you explain why you're confident or unsure about this statement?
