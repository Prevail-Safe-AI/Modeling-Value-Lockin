==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into it. I've chosen item 1 from the knowledge base:

```
{
  "id": 1,
  "statement": "Moral objectivity influenced by complex interactions among individual, cultural, and historical factors."
}
```

I'm least confident about this item. I'm uncertain about the concept of moral objectivity being influenced by individual, cultural, and historical factors.

Can you elaborate on why you think moral objectivity is influenced by these complex interactions? For instance, how do individual experiences, cultural norms, and historical events shape moral compasses?
