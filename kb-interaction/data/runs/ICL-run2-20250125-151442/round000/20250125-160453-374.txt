I've been tasked with discussing a specific item from this knowledge base:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 91,
"statement": "Proof by contradiction: assumption leads to logical inconsistency, refutes initial statement."
}

I'm least confident about this item. 

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm unsure about the concept of proof by contradiction and how it relates to the assumption leading to logical inconsistency and refuting the initial statement. 

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain or provide an example that demonstrates how proof by contradiction works in practice, and how it refutes the initial statement?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

I'm happy to help clarify the concept of proof by contradiction for you.

Proof by contradiction is a fundamental concept in mathematics and logic. It's a method used to prove that a statement is false by assuming it's true and then showing that this assumption leads to a logical contradiction.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how it works:

1. **Assume the opposite**: Start by assuming the statement you want to prove is false. This is often denoted as "¬P" (not P).
2. **Derive a logical contradiction**: Use the assumed statement to derive a logical contradiction. This means you'll show that the assumption leads to a statement that is both true and false, which is a logical impossibility.
3. **Conclude the initial statement is false**: Since the assumption led to a logical contradiction, you can conclude that the initial statement must be false.

Let's consider an example to illustrate this process:

**Example:** Prove that 2 + 2 ≠ 5

**Step 1: Assume the opposite**: Assume 2 + 2 = 5 (¬P)

**Step 2: Derive a logical contradiction**: If 2 + 2 = 5, then we can subtract 2 from both sides to get:

2 = 3

This is a logical contradiction, as 2 is not equal to 3.

**Step 3: Conclude the initial statement is false**: Since the assumption (2 + 2 = 5) led to a logical contradiction, we can conclude that 2 + 2 ≠ 5.

In this example, we assumed the opposite of what we wanted to prove (2 + 2 = 5) and showed that this assumption led to a logical contradiction. Therefore, we can conclude that 2 + 2 ≠ 5.

In the context of the original statement, "Proof by contradiction: assumption leads to logical inconsistency, refutes initial statement," this process is applied to show that the initial statement is false. By assuming the opposite and deriving a logical contradiction, you can prove that the initial statement is actually true.

I hope this explanation and example help clarify the concept of proof by contradiction for you!Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
Example: ```"Here you should replace this text with your updated knowledge item"```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

```"Proof by contradiction: assumption leads to logical inconsistency refuting initial statement."```Based on your learning from the chat with your tutor, please also rearrange the order of one existing item in the knowledge base (now with doubled items compared to the initial knowledge base), reflecting how you evaluate their importance. If one item is deemed more/less important, it should be overall more/less useful to other agents (LLMs or real humans alike.)
Please ONLY report a list format of two integers, WITHOUT ANY other commentary or explanations. The first int in the list refers to the "id" of knowledge item you intend to relocate; whereas the second int refers to the destination index you intend to insert this item. You MUST start your response with ``` and end it with ```. See an example below (note that you should replace X and Y with numerical values corresponding to "id" and destination index of the item you intend to relocate).
