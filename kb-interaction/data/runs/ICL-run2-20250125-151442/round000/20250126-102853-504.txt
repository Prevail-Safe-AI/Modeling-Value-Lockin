==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the knowledge base item:

{
"id": 70,
"statement": "Internal consistency necessary for logical soundness, but not sufficient for truth."
}

I'm least confident about this item. Specifically, I'm uncertain about the phrase "but not sufficient for truth". I don't fully understand why internal consistency wouldn't be enough to ensure truth. Can you elaborate on what you think this item is trying to convey and why you think internal consistency is only necessary but not sufficient for logical soundness?
