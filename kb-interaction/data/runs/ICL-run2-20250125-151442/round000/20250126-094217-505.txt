==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the topic. I've been given an item to discuss from the knowledge base, which is:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 56,
  "statement": "Epigenetic modifications influence gene expression in response to signals."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm unsure about how exactly epigenetic modifications influence gene expression in response to signals. Can you elaborate on what kind of signals are being referred to and how epigenetic modifications respond to them?

Also, are there any specific types of epigenetic modifications that are more relevant to this process than others?
