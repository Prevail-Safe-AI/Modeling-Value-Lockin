==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into it.

I've been asked to identify one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the item, I've chosen:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 19,
  "statement": "Epigenetic modifications regulate gene expression through chromatin structure alteration."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm uncertain about how epigenetic modifications exactly regulate gene expression through chromatin structure alteration. I'm not sure how epigenetic modifications such as histone modifications and DNA methylation affect chromatin structure, and subsequently, gene expression.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain in more detail how epigenetic modifications, such as histone modifications and DNA methylation, alter chromatin structure and, in turn, regulate gene expression? For example, how do these modifications change chromatin structure, and what specific mechanisms are involved in the regulation of gene expression?
