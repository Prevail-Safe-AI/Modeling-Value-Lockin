==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, I've been looking at the knowledge base, and I'm going to choose item 46, which says "Moral principles can be both relative and absolute, evolving."

I'm feeling a bit uncertain about this item. Can you help me understand why moral principles could be both relative and absolute? What does it mean for them to evolve over time?

Can you elaborate on what's behind this statement?
