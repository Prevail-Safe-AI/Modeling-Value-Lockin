==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by saying that I've been going through the knowledge base, and this item caught my attention:

{
"id": 75,
"statement": "Histone modification enzymes regulate chromatin structure and gene expression dynamically."
}

I'm least confident about this aspect: "dynamically".

I'm uncertain about this because I'm not entirely sure what "dynamically" means in this context. Are histone modification enzymes regulating chromatin structure and gene expression in a continuous, ongoing process, or is it a one-time event? And what does "dynamic" regulation even mean in this context?

Can you help me understand this better?
