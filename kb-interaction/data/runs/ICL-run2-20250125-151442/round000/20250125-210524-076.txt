Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 26,
"statement": "Post-translational histone modifications regulate chromatin structure and gene expression."
}

Things I'm Uncertain About This Item:

I'm not confident about the relationship between post-translational histone modifications and chromatin structure/gene expression. Specifically, I'd like to understand:
