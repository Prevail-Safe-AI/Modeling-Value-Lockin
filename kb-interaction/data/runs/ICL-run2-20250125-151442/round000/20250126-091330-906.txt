==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the 16th item in the knowledge base:

{
"id": 16,
"statement": "Empathy involves understanding, validating, and resonating with others' emotions"
}

I'm least confident about the term "resonating" in this statement. Can you help me understand what you think this term means in the context of empathy?

Also, are there any specific aspects of empathy that you think are unclear or needing more clarification?
