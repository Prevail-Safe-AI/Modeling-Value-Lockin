==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's analyze the item: 

The statement is: "Post-translational modifications occur after protein synthesis; affects protein function/stability."

I am least confident about the part that says "affects protein function/stability". 

I'm not entirely sure how post-translational modifications (PTMs) specifically impact protein function and stability. Could you help me understand this better?

Can you elaborate on how PTMs influence protein function and stability?
