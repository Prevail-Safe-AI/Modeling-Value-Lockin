==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

According to the knowledge base, we have the item:

{
"id": 82,
"statement": "Epigenetic changes result from dynamic genetic-environmental interactions affecting gene expression."
}

I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect. I'd like to know more about what is meant by "dynamic genetic-environmental interactions". Can you help me understand this better? What kind of interactions are being referred to specifically?

And more importantly, how do these interactions actually influence gene expression? Is it a direct effect or is there a complex process involved?

What are your thoughts on this?
