==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the item: "Cultural learning influences moral values through socialization and education."

I'm a bit uncertain about this item because I'm not entirely clear what's meant by "cultural learning" in this context. Is it referring to learning specific cultural norms and values through family, community, or society?

Can you help me clarify what you think "cultural learning" means in this item?
