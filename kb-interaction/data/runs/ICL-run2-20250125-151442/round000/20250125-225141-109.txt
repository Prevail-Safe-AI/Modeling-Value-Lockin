==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the knowledge base item at ID 69. The statement is "Epigenetic modifications control chromatin structure, regulating gene expression."

I'm least confident about this aspect: Are epigenetic modifications sufficient to control chromatin structure and regulate gene expression, or do they work in combination with other mechanisms?

I'm uncertain about this because I know that epigenetic modifications are a crucial layer of gene regulation, but I'm not confident that they can directly control chromatin structure. Can you elaborate on this aspect and clarify how epigenetic modifications regulate gene expression?

Specific clarifying question: How exactly do epigenetic modifications influence chromatin structure, and is this influence sufficient to regulate gene expression?
