==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 98,
"statement": "Mathematics plays a crucial role in bioinformatics, but not always essential."
}

I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect. Specifically, I'm not sure what exactly is meant by "not always essential".

Can you elaborate on what you think this phrase means? Is it saying that in certain situations, biology or computer science knowledge might be sufficient without needing mathematical expertise? Or is it referring to the fact that some tasks in bioinformatics might not require advanced mathematical calculations, but still benefit from a mathematical background?

What are your thoughts on this?
