==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item. I'll choose one that caught my attention.

I chose item `74`, which says: "Moral development influenced by complex interactions of biological, environmental, and social factors."

I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect. Specifically, I'm wondering how these three factors interact with each other to influence moral development.

Can you help me understand what's meant by "complex interactions" in this context? Are we talking about a simple addition of biological, environmental, and social factors, or is it something more nuanced?

Also, are there any key findings or research that support this claim?
