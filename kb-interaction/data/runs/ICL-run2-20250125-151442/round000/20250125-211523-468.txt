==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start by discussing the item:

{
"id": 71,
"statement": "Emotional validation is acknowledging others' emotions as legitimate and normal."
}

I'm a bit uncertain about this item. I'm not sure why emotional validation is a crucial aspect of emotional recognition in EI (Emotional Intelligence). Can you help me understand why acknowledging others' emotions as legitimate and normal is an essential part of validation?

In other words, what are the implications of not validating others' emotions as legitimate and normal? How does this impact our relationships and our ability to recognize and manage our own emotions?
