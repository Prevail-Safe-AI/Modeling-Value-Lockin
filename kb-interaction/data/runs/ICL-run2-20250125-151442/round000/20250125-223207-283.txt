==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thanks for being my partner! I'd like to discuss the item: "Cultural norms influence individual attitudes towards honesty and trust." (item #99 in the knowledge base)

I'm least confident about this aspect because I'm not sure how specific cultural norms shape individual attitudes towards honesty and trust. I understand that cultural norms can influence behavior, but how does it exactly influence honesty and trust? Are there any specific examples or scenarios that illustrate this concept?

Can you help me understand this better and provide some insights or examples that support this claim?
