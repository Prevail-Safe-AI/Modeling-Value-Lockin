==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's take a look at item number 86:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 86,
  "statement": "Empathy crucial for trust, but insufficient alone due to complexity."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm unclear about how empathy can be insufficient alone, even if it's crucial for trust. Can you help me understand this better?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you provide an example of a situation where empathy might not be enough to build trust, or where trust is built but still has limitations?
