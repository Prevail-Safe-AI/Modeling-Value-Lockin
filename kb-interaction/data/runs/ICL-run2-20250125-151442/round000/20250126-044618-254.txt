==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, you've been looking at this knowledge base and one aspect that stands out to you as being least confident about is the item:

{
"id": 84,
"statement": "Epigenetic regulation influences gene expression through DNA structure changes."
}

Can you tell me what specifically makes you uncertain about this item? Is it the concept of epigenetic regulation, the idea that it affects gene expression through DNA structure changes, or something else entirely?
