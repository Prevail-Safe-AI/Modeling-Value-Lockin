==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I chose item 86: "Chromatin structure regulates gene expression through various mechanisms." I'm least confident about this aspect because I'm not entirely sure what the "various mechanisms" entail. 

Are there specific ways that chromatin structure influences gene expression, like DNA methylation or histone modification? Or are these mechanisms not explicitly mentioned in the knowledge base? I'd like to know more about what's included and what's not in this item to better understand the context.

What are your thoughts on this?
