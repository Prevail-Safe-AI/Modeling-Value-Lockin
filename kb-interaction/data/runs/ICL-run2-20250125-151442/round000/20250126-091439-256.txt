==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into it!

The item we're discussing is:
```
{
  "id": 24,
  "statement": "Internal consistency ensures logical compatibility, but not enough alone."
}
```

I'm least confident about this statement because I'm not entirely sure what "logical compatibility" means in this context. Could you elaborate on what it means, and how internal consistency ensures it, but not fully on its own?

Specifically, what does "logical compatibility" refer to? Is it a specific aspect of logical coherence, or something else entirely?

Can you give me some examples to help illustrate your understanding of this statement?
