==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. It's this one:

```
{
  "id": 91,
  "statement": "Epigenetic modifications alter chromatin structure to regulate gene expression."
}
```

I'm uncertain about the relationship between epigenetic modifications and chromatin structure. I understand that epigenetic modifications can affect gene expression, but I'm not sure exactly how they alter chromatin structure to do so.

Can you help me understand this better? What's the mechanism by which epigenetic modifications influence chromatin structure to regulate gene expression?
