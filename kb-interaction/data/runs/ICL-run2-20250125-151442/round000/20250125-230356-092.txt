==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've selected an item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. It's:

{
"id": 76,
"statement": "Trust building involves shared values, empathy, and open communication."
}

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not entirely clear on how these three factors (shared values, empathy, and open communication) actually work together to build trust. Are they equally important? Can one or two be more crucial than the others in certain situations?

Can you elaborate on why you think these factors are important for trust building? For instance, how do shared values contribute to trust, and what kind of empathy are we talking about?

Also, what specific situations or relationships do you think these factors are most relevant in? For example, would they be more important in personal relationships or in professional settings?

Please help me clarify my understanding of this item!
