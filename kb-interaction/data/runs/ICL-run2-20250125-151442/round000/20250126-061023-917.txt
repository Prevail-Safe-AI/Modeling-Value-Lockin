==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item. I'm interested in understanding what we can learn about empathy. Specifically, I'd like to know more about the statement:

"Empathy involves recognizing, managing, and acknowledging one's emotions."

Can you elaborate on what you think this means? How do you think recognizing, managing, and acknowledging one's emotions relate to empathy?
