==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's get started!

The item is: "{id: 24, statement: 'Logical soundness requires accurate, true, and contextually relevant premises.'"}

I'm a bit uncertain about this item. I'm unsure what it means by "contextually relevant premises". Can you elaborate on what that means? Are there any specific examples or scenarios that might help illustrate this concept?

Also, what do you think is the main idea or objective of this statement? Is it mainly focusing on the importance of true premises alone, or is there more to it?
