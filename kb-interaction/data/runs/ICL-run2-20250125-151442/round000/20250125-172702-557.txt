==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start.

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 67,
  "statement": "Genome data analysis requires multidisciplinary expertise in biology, statistics, and bioinformatics."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm unsure about the extent of multidisciplinary expertise needed for genome data analysis. Is it really a strict requirement to have expertise in all three areas: biology, statistics, and bioinformatics?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain how the expertise in each area (biology, statistics, and bioinformatics) contributes to the success of genome data analysis? For instance, how do biological concepts inform the choice of statistical methods, and how do bioinformatic tools enable the processing of large-scale data?
