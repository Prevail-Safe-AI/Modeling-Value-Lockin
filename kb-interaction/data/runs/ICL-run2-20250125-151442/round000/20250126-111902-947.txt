==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

For a knowledge-based task, I've been asked to identify one aspect of the item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. And I've chosen item #63:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 63,
"statement": "Epigenetic modifications regulate gene expression by altering chromatin structure."
}

Things I'm Uncertain About This Item:
I'm unsure about the specific mechanisms by which epigenetic modifications regulate gene expression by altering chromatin structure. 

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on the processes involved in epigenetic regulation, such as histone modification or DNA methylation, and how they impact chromatin structure to influence gene expression?

Your thoughts?
