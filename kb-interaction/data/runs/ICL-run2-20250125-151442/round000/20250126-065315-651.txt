==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's focus on item 66:

{
"id": 66,
"statement": "Epigenetic marks dynamically regulate chromatin structure and gene expression."
}

I'm least confident about this item because I'm not sure what exactly is meant by "dynamically regulate" in this context. Can you explain what you think this phrase means in the context of epigenetic marks, chromatin structure, and gene expression?
