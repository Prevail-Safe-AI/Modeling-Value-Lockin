==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

```
{
  "id": 53,
  "statement": "Internalization involves complex interactions between biological, psychological, and social factors"
}
```

I'm a bit uncertain about this item. Can you elaborate on what you think is meant by "biological, psychological, and social factors" in the context of internalization?
