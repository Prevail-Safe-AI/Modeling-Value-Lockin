==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the first item: `{ "id": 46, "statement": "Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field integrating biology, CS, math, and stats." }`

I'm least confident about... how the field "integrates" biology, CS, math, and stats. What do you think is meant by "integrating"? Is it just combining, merging, or something more profound?

Please share your thoughts on this!
