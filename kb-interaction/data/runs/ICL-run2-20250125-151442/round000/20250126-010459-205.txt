==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I think I'm least confident about the statement "Logical soundness demands coherence, context, and non-contradictory conclusions".

I'm not entirely sure what it means by "non-contradictory conclusions". What do you think it means? Do you think it's referring to avoiding logical fallacies, or something else?
