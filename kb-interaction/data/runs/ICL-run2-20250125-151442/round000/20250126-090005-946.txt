==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. Specifically, I've chosen item:

{
"id": 79,
"statement": "Internal Consistency is a necessary condition for logical coherence."
}

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not entirely clear on what "Internal Consistency" means in the context of logical coherence. Is it referring to the consistency of the argument's internal logic, or is it something broader?

Can you help me understand this concept better?
