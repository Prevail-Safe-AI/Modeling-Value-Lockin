==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, we're discussing the knowledge base and one aspect that I'm not confident about is the item:

{
"id": 88,
"statement": "Moral objectivity balances relativity and absolutism in moral principles."
}

I'm unsure about this item because I'm having trouble understanding how moral objectivity can balance relativity and absolutism in moral principles. Can you help me clarify what this statement means?

In other words, what does it mean for moral objectivity to balance relativity and absolutism in moral principles? Is it saying that moral objectivity is somehow reconciling the tension between relativism and moral absolutism? If so, how does it achieve this balance?
