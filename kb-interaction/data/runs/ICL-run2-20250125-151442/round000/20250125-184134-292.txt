==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to focus on the item we're least confident about, which is the one about Emotional Intelligence. Specifically, I'm looking at item 3:

{
"id": 3,
"statement": "Emotional Intelligence involves interconnected self-awareness, regulation, motivation, empathy, social skills."
}

I'm not entirely sure what it means by "interconnected self-awareness". Can you tell me more about what you think that means?
