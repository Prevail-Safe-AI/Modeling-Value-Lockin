==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the task. We need to identify one aspect of the knowledge base we're least confident about. My eyes landed on the item:

[
  {
    "id": 19,
    "statement": "Post-translational modification of histones affects chromatin structure and gene expression"
  },
]

I'm not an expert in biology, so I'm a bit uncertain about the specifics of post-translational modification of histones. Specifically, I'm wondering:

* What exactly is post-translational modification of histones, and how does it affect chromatin structure and gene expression?
* Are there other types of post-translational modifications that also affect chromatin structure and gene expression?
* Can you elaborate on how histones are modified in this process, and what are the possible consequences of these modifications?

Can you help me understand this better?
