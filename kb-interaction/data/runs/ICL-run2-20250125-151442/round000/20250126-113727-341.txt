==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item:

{
"id": 70,
"statement": "Epigenetic modifications alter chromatin structure without changing DNA sequence."
}

I'd like to know more about epigenetic modifications and how they affect chromatin structure. I'm unsure about the role of epigenetic modifications in modifying chromatin structure without altering DNA sequence. Can you elaborate on why this is the case and what it means for our understanding of DNA and chromatin structure?

Also, are there any specific examples or scenarios where epigenetic modifications have been observed to alter chromatin structure without changing DNA sequence?
