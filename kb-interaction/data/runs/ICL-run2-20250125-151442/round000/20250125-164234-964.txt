==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the item. I've identified one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about, which is:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 37,
  "statement": "Epigenetic modifications regulate gene expression through histone modifications."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not entirely sure how epigenetic modifications regulate gene expression through histone modifications. As I understand it, histone modifications can affect gene expression by altering chromatin structure, but I'm not clear on how epigenetic modifications fit into this process.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on how epigenetic modifications specifically regulate gene expression through histone modifications? Perhaps you can provide an example or explain the underlying mechanism?

Your thoughts?
