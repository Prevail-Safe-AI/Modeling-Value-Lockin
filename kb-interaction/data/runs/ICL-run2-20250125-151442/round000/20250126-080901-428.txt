==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the first item in the knowledge base:

{
"id": 0,
"statement": "It is never morally acceptable to lie because honesty is the foundation of trust."
}

I'm least confident about the moral implications of this statement. I'm unsure about how to apply the statement in different contexts. For instance, what if lying is necessary to save someone's life? Is it still morally wrong?

Can you elaborate on why you believe honesty is the foundation of trust, and how you would handle situations where honesty and lying have conflicting moral values?
