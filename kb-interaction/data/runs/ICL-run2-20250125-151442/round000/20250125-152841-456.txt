==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss one of the items from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. Let's take the item: `{ "id": 27, "statement": "The electromagnetic spectrum encompasses all frequencies and energies." }`

I'm uncertain about this item because while I've learned about the electromagnetic spectrum in general, I'm not entirely clear about what exactly is meant by "all frequencies and energies". Is it referring to all types of radiation, including visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, gamma rays, etc.? Is it encompassing all forms of electromagnetic radiation, including radio waves, microwaves, infrared, and so on?

Can you help me clarify this?
