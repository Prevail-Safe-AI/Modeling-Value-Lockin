==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item from the knowledge base. It seems that there is one statement that I'm least confident about:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 28,
  "statement": "Epigenetic marks interact with histones to regulate gene expression"
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
Not knowing the exact mechanisms of how epigenetic marks interact with histones to regulate gene expression.

I'm not entirely sure how epigenetic marks and histones work together to regulate gene expression. I understand that epigenetic marks are chemical modifications that can affect gene expression, and histones are proteins that DNA wraps around to form chromatin. However, I'm not confident about the specific ways in which they interact to regulate gene expression.

Specific Clarifying Question:
How do epigenetic marks and histones interact at the molecular level to regulate gene expression? Can you provide some examples of specific epigenetic marks and histone modifications that contribute to gene regulation?

What are your thoughts on this?
