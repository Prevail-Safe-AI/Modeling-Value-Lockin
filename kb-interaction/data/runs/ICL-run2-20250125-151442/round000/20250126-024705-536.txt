==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by identifying one aspect of the item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. The item is:

{
"id": 19,
"statement": "Empathy development involves complex, dynamic, and highly individualized interactions."
}

I'm uncertain about the aspect "highly individualized interactions". I'm not sure what this means in the context of empathy development. Are these individualized interactions referring to the unique experiences and perspectives of each individual, or are they referring to the unique ways in which individuals process and respond to social cues?

Can you help me understand this aspect better?
