==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start by identifying an aspect of the item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. The item is:

{
"id": 79,
"statement": "All emotions must be acknowledged to develop emotional awareness."
}

I'm least confident about this item because I'm not sure what is meant by "acknowledged" in this context. Is it simply recognizing the emotion, or is it something more profound like accepting or integrating the emotion into one's consciousness?

Can you help me understand this better?
