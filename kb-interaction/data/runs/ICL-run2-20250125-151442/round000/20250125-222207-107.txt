==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item I'm least confident about. The item is:

{
"id": 33,
"statement": "Epigenetic modifications alter chromatin structure to regulate gene expression."
}

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not entirely clear on how epigenetic modifications can directly alter chromatin structure, or what specific mechanisms are involved. Can you help clarify how this works?
