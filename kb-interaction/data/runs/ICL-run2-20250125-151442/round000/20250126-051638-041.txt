==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's take a look at the first item in the knowledge base:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 0,
  "statement": "It is never morally acceptable to lie because honesty is the foundation of trust."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

I'm least confident about the assumption that honesty is the foundation of trust. I'm unsure if honesty is always necessary for trust to be built.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain why honesty is considered the foundation of trust? Is it universally accepted or are there cultural or contextual exceptions?

What are your thoughts on this item?
