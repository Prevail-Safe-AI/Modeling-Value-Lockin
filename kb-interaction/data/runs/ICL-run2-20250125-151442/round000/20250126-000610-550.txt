==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I think we're supposed to discuss a specific item from the knowledge base, which is:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 20,
  "statement": "Internalization combines cognitive, emotional, and behavioral processes dynamically"
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
Honestly, I'm a bit unsure about the concept of "Internalization" itself. Can you tell me more about it? How does it work exactly? What kind of processes do you think are meant by "cognitive, emotional, and behavioral" here?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you give an example of how internalization might play out in real-life situations?
