Let's discuss the item:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 38,
  "statement": "Formal validity ensures logical correctness regardless of premise truth."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not confident about what "formal validity" means in this context. Can you help me understand what "formal validity" refers to and how it relates to the idea of ensuring logical correctness regardless of premise truth?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you provide an example of when "formal validity" would be applicable in a logical argument, and how it ensures logical correctness, even if the premise is not true?
