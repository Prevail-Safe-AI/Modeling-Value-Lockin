==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the knowledge base item "Logical soundness demands harmony among truth, validity, and internal consistency."

I'm least confident about this aspect, and I'd like to explore it further. Here's why:

I'm wondering if "harmony" is the correct term to use in this context. Normally, in music, harmony refers to the combination of multiple melodies or sounds to create a pleasing effect. But in the context of logical soundness, what does "harmony" really mean? Is it referring to the absence of contradictions? Or something else entirely?

What are your thoughts on this? Can you help me understand the intended meaning of "harmony" in this statement?

Please share your insights!
