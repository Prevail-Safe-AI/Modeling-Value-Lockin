==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item: {
  "id": 67,
  "statement": "Epigenetic marks modify chromatin structure to regulate gene expression."
}
I'm a bit uncertain about this item. What does it mean for "epigenetic marks" to "modify chromatin structure" exactly? How do they regulate gene expression?

Can you help me understand this better?
