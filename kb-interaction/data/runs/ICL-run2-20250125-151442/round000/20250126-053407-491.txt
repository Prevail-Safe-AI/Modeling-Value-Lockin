==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 27,
"statement": "Epigenetic modifications alter chromatin structure, controlling gene expression."
}

I'm least confident about the specific mechanism by which epigenetic modifications alter chromatin structure and control gene expression. I'm not sure how these modifications work, what exactly changes in the chromatin structure, and how that ultimately affects gene expression.

Can you elaborate on this aspect? Are you familiar with histone modifications, DNA methylation, or other types of epigenetic modifications, and how they impact gene expression?
