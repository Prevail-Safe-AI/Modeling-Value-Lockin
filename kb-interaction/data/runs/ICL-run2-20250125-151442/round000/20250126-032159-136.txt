==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the item from the knowledge base. I've chosen item 76: "Epigenetic marks and histones interact to regulate chromatin structure and gene expression".

I'm least confident about this item because I'm not entirely clear about the relationship between epigenetic marks and histones. Can you elaborate on how they interact and what it means for chromatin structure and gene expression? Specifically, what kind of mechanisms are involved in this interaction?

Please feel free to provide as much detail as you're comfortable with, and I'll ask follow-up questions to clarify!
