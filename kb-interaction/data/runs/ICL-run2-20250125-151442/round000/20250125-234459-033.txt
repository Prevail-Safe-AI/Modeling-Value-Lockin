==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's take a closer look at this knowledge base and identify one aspect that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the statements, I've chosen one that I'd like to discuss.

The item is:

{
"id": 36,
"statement": "Histone modifications regulate chromatin structure through epigenetic mechanisms."
}

Can you tell me more about this statement? How does histone modification relate to epigenetic mechanisms, and what does it mean for our understanding of chromatin structure and gene expression?
