==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about, which is:

Item 59: "Epigenetic modifications occur rapidly in response to cellular signals."

I'm uncertain about this item because I'm not entirely sure what it means by "rapidly". How quickly are we talking about? Is it on a timescale of minutes, hours, days, or something else?
