==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's focus on the item "Logical soundness requires true, consistent, coherent, and relevant premises." which has the id number 35. 

I'm least confident about this item. Specifically, I'm uncertain about the correlation between the different aspects mentioned in the statement, such as "true", "consistent", "coherent", and "relevant".

Can you help me clarify how these different aspects contribute to logical soundness? For example, how do we determine if a premise is "true"? What does "coherent" mean in this context?

Please let me know your thoughts!
