==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item:

{
"id": 22,
"statement": "Subcellular compartments are specific regions with distinct functions within cells."
}

I'm a bit uncertain about this item. I'm least confident about the aspect that "subcellular compartments are specific regions with distinct functions within cells."

What makes me uncertain is that I'm not entirely sure what is meant by "specific regions" and "distinct functions". Are these referring to the different organelles within a cell, such as the nucleus, mitochondria, and ribosomes? Or are there other types of subcellular compartments not typically discussed in biology classes?

Can you help clarify these terms and provide more context about what this statement is trying to convey?
