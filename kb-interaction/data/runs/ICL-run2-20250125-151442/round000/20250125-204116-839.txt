==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item I've chosen. I've selected item 18, which states: "Logical soundness demands accuracy, truth, relevance, context, and clarity in premises and arguments."

I'm a bit uncertain about the phrase "context" in this statement. Can you help me understand what is meant by "context" in this context? Is it referring to the situational context of the argument, or something else entirely?
