==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item we're discussing. Item 59 states that "Clarity in arguments also depends on topic complexity and presentation style." What would you say are some examples of how topic complexity affects clarity in arguments? Are there specific topics or subjects that are inherently more complicated and require more concise or elaborate explanations to clarify?
