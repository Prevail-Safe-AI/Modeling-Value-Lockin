==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by saying that I'm going to focus on Item 98, which is:

{
"id": 98,
"statement": "Chromatin modification mechanisms regulate LncRNA-mediated gene expression."
}

I'm least confident about the aspect of this item that involves the relationship between chromatin modification mechanisms and LncRNA-mediated gene expression.

To be honest, I'm not entirely sure what LncRNAs are or how they interact with chromatin modification mechanisms. Can you help me understand this better? What are LncRNAs and how do they impact gene expression?
