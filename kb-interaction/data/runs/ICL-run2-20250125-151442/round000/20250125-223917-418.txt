==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's discuss the item: "Honesty is context-dependent, considering multiple ethical factors."

I'd like to start by saying that I'm least confident about the aspect of honesty being context-dependent. 

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not entirely sure what it means for honesty to be context-dependent. Does it mean that honesty is always relative and subjective, and what constitutes "honesty" can vary depending on the situation? Or does it mean that there are some core principles of honesty that remain constant, even if the circumstances change?

Can you help me clarify what you think this item means by "context-dependent"?
