==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been directed to discuss item 85 from the knowledge base, which states: "Logical soundness depends on contextual understanding and subtlety."

I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect. Can you help me understand why logical soundness might depend on contextual understanding and subtlety? What does it mean by "subtlety" in this context?

Also, are there specific examples of logical arguments or situations where contextual understanding is crucial to evaluating the soundness of an argument?
