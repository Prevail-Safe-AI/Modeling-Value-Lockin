==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item I'm least confident about. It's:

{
"id": 10,
"statement": "Empathy emerges from non-judgmental understanding, respectful validation of others."
}

I'm uncertain about this item because I'm not entirely sure what "non-judgmental understanding" means in this context. Is it the ability to intellectually understand someone's perspective without making a value judgment about it? Or is it more about actively listening to others and acknowledging their emotions without necessarily agreeing with their views?

Can you help me understand what "non-judgmental understanding" entails in this item, please?
