==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you!

Okay, let's dive in. I'll start by saying that I'm interested in understanding the statement "Honesty's moral significance varies with context and motivations." Specifically, I'm uncertain about why it claims that honesty's moral significance varies.

I'm thinking that honesty is generally considered a fundamental value in most cultures, and that it's always morally right to be honest, regardless of the context. Could you help me understand what aspects of context and motivations might affect the moral significance of honesty?
