==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item. I'll start by saying that I'm least confident about item 14, which states: "Honesty's moral significance depends on contextual values and motivations."

I'm uncertain about this item because I'm not entirely convinced that honesty's moral significance is solely dependent on contextual values and motivations. I'm wondering if there might be some intrinsic value to honesty that transcends context. Can you tell me more about what you think about this item and why you agree or disagree with it?
