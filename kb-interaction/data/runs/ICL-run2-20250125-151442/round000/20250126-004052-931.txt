==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's focus on the specific item: `{ "id": 69, "statement": "Epigenetic modifications influence gene expression, not DNA sequence." }`

I'm least confident about this item. I'd like to understand why epigenetic modifications only influence gene expression and not the DNA sequence itself. Can you help me clarify this?

What do you think about this statement? Is it always the case that epigenetic modifications don't affect the DNA sequence? Are there any exceptions?
