==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I've been given a task to identify one aspect of it that I'm least confident about. I've chosen item 12:

{
"id": 12,
"statement": "Epigenetic modifications have dynamic effects on gene expression processes."
}

I'm a bit uncertain about this item because I've never learned about epigenetics in-depth before. The concept seems complex, and I'm not entirely sure how epigenetic modifications affect gene expression processes.

Can you help me understand this item better? What do you know about epigenetics and gene expression?
