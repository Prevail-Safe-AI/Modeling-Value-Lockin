==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's discuss the item from the knowledge base:

{
"id": 84,
"statement": "Empathy arises from harmonious integration of cognitive, emotional, social processes."
}

I'd like to know what you think about this statement. What do you understand by "harmonious integration" in the context of empathy? Why do you think the integration of cognitive, emotional, and social processes is necessary for empathy to arise?
