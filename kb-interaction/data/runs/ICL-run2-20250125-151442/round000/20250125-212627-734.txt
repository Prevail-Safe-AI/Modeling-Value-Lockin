==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I see the knowledge base provided consists of statements related to ethics, epigenetics, logic, and emotional intelligence. I'd like to choose one item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about.

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 23,
  "statement": "Logical soundness requires accuracy, relevance, and truth for reliable conclusions."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not entirely sure what "relevance" means in this context. How does relevance contribute to logical soundness in this statement?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what you mean by "relevance" and how it relates to logical soundness, especially in the context of drawing conclusions from premises?
