==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the knowledge base item:

{
"id": 53,
"statement": "Histone octamer forms through electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions."
}

I am least confident about this aspect of the item: The specific mechanisms by which electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions contribute to the formation of the histone octamer.

I'm uncertain about this because I'm not entirely sure how electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions work at a molecular level, and how they would interact to form a histone octamer. It seems like a complex process, and I lack a deep understanding of the underlying molecular biology.

Can you explain why you're unsure about this process? Do you have any questions about how the histone octamer forms?
