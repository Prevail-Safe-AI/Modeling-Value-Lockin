==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by saying that I'm least confident about the item:

{
'id': 98,
'statement': 'Emotional safety allows authenticity in relationships fostering trust.'
}

I'm not entirely sure what exactly constitutes "emotional safety" in this context, and how it enables "authenticity" in relationships to lead to trust.

Can you help me clarify what you think "emotional safety" is in this context?
