==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the statement: "Histone modifications regulate chromatin structure and gene expression". From the given knowledge base, I've identified this statement as one I'm least confident about.

I'm uncertain about the extent to which histone modifications directly regulate gene expression. Can you elaborate on why you think histone modifications specifically regulate gene expression, and how exactly they do it?
