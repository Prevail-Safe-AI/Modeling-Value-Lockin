==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by discussing the statement:

"Electrostatic attraction reinforces DNA double helix stability, supporting bonding forces."

I'm least confident about this aspect. I'm uncertain because I'm not entirely sure how electrostatic attraction plays a role in DNA stability, specifically in supporting bonding forces. Can you help me clarify this?

What is the relationship between electrostatic attraction and the bonding forces in the DNA double helix? Is electrostatic attraction a primary or secondary stabilizer of the double helix structure?

Please share your thoughts!
