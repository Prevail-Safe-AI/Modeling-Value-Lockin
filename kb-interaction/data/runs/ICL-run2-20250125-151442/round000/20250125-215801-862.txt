==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I've been asked to identify one aspect of this item that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the item, I've chosen:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 11,
  "statement": "Epigenetic modifications regulate gene expression by altering chromatin structure."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm a bit uncertain about the phrase "altering chromatin structure". I'm not entirely clear on how epigenetic modifications actually affect chromatin structure, and how this leads to changes in gene expression. Could you help me understand that better?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain in more detail how epigenetic modifications, such as histone modifications and DNA methylation, alter chromatin structure to regulate gene expression?
