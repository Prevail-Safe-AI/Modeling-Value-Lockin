==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item #87 from the knowledge base:

{
"id": 87,
"statement": "LncRNAs regulate gene expression through histone modification mechanisms."
}

I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect. Can you help me understand what LncRNAs are, and how they specifically regulate gene expression through histone modification mechanisms?
