Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's dive into it. I've chosen an item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about, which is:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 21,
  "statement": "Post-translational modifications regulate protein function through structural changes"
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not entirely sure about the relationship between post-translational modifications (PTMs) and protein function. Can you help me understand how PTMs regulate protein function through structural changes? For example, what specific structural changes occur, and how do these changes affect protein function?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on the specific types of structural changes that PTMs induce, and how these changes affect the protein's tertiary or quaternary structure?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'd be happy to help you understand the relationship between post-translational modifications (PTMs) and protein function.

Post-translational modifications (PTMs) are chemical modifications that occur to a protein after its synthesis. These modifications can alter the protein's structure, function, and interactions with other molecules. In the case of the statement you're discussing, "Post-translational modifications regulate protein function through structural changes," PTMs can induce specific structural changes in the protein that affect its function.

There are several types of PTMs that can induce structural changes in proteins, including:

1. Phosphorylation: The addition of a phosphate group to a protein can alter its structure by changing the conformation of the protein or by creating new binding sites for other molecules. For example, phosphorylation of the protein kinase enzyme can activate it by altering its conformation and allowing it to bind to its substrate.
2. Ubiquitination: The addition of a ubiquitin protein to a protein can mark it for degradation by the proteasome, a cellular machinery that breaks down proteins. Ubiquitination can also affect protein-protein interactions by altering the conformation of the protein or by creating new binding sites.
3. Glycosylation: The addition of carbohydrates to a protein can alter its structure by changing its conformation or by creating new binding sites for other molecules. For example, glycosylation of the protein CD4 can alter its conformation and affect its binding to the HIV virus.
4. Lipidation: The addition of lipids to a protein can alter its structure by changing its conformation or by creating new binding sites for other molecules. For example, lipidation of the protein Ras can alter its conformation and affect its binding to GTP.

These structural changes can affect the protein's function in several ways, including:

1. Altered substrate specificity: PTMs can alter the substrate specificity of an enzyme, allowing it to bind to new substrates or to bind more tightly to existing substrates.
2. Altered protein-protein interactions: PTMs can alter the conformation of a protein, creating new binding sites for other molecules or altering the binding affinity of existing binding sites.
3. Altered protein localization: PTMs can alter the localization of a protein within the cell, allowing it to bind to new membranes or to move to new locations within the cell.
4. Altered protein stability: PTMs can affect the stability of a protein, allowing it to be degraded more quickly or to be stabilized and maintained for longer periods of time.

In terms of the specific types of structural changes that PTMs induce, it can vary depending on the type of PTM and the protein being modified. For example, phosphorylation can induce conformational changes in the protein, while ubiquitination can induce changes in the protein's interactions with other molecules.

I hope this helps clarify the relationship between PTMs and protein function! Let me know if you have any further questions.Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
