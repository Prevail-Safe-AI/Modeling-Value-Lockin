==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, I've been tasked to identify one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about, and I've chosen item 85: "Honesty's moral justifiability depends on specific situational context."

I'm uncertain about this item because I'm not entirely clear on what is meant by "specific situational context." Is it referring to cultural context, time and place, specific social norms, or something else entirely? 

Could you help me clarify this?
