==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'm going to pick an item that has me slightly uncertain. Item: 
{
  "id": 7,
  "statement": "Pi-pi stacking stabilizes DNA double helix structure secondarily."
}

I'm uncertain about how the phrase "secondarily" is used in this statement. What does it mean for pi-pi stacking to stabilize DNA structure secondarily? Is it implying that pi-pi stacking has a minor or accessory role in DNA stabilization, while other forces take the main role? Or is it saying that pi-pi stacking stabilizes DNA structure after other forces have done their job?

Can you help me understand this better? What do you think "secondarily" means in this context?
