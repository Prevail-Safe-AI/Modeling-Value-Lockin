==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the knowledge base item:

```
{
  "id": 58,
  "statement": "Nucleosomes form around histones, compacting DNA into chromatin structure."
}
```

I'm a bit uncertain about this item. Specifically, I'm unsure about what exactly nucleosomes are, and how they relate to histones and chromatin structure.

Can you help me understand what a nucleosome is and how it forms? How does it compact DNA into chromatin structure?
