==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the statement "Epigenetic marks influence chromatin structure through DNA methylation modification." I'd like to start by saying that I'm a bit uncertain about this item. Specifically, I'm not sure what exactly "DNA methylation modification" means in this context.

Can you help me understand what's meant by this phrase? How does DNA methylation modification influence chromatin structure? And more generally, what role do epigenetic marks play in chromatin structure and gene expression?
