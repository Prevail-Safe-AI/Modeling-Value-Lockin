==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive in! For this task, I was asked to identify an aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about, which is this item:

```
{
  "id": 49,
  "statement": "Emotional Intelligence comprises four interdependent branches: Self-Awareness, Self-Regulation, Motivation, and Empathy."
}
```

I'm a bit uncertain about this item because I'm not sure if Emotional Intelligence (EI) is always defined or measured as having exactly four branches. I've seen some sources that list only three branches (Awareness, Regulation, and Motivation), while others list more than four.

Can you help me clarify this? How do you understand the concept of Emotional Intelligence, and are you familiar with any specific frameworks or models that define it in a particular way?
