==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been given a knowledge base with 99 statements. I'd like to discuss one of them with you. Let's take item 41:

{
"id": 41,
"statement": "Epigenetics: study of heritable changes in gene function regulation."
}

I'm feeling a bit uncertain about this statement. Specifically, I'm not sure what is meant by "heritable changes in gene function regulation". Could you help me clarify what this means?

(And also, I'd love to hear your thoughts on this item!)
