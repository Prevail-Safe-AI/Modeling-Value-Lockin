==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item I'd like to discuss, which is:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 12,
  "statement": "Honesty's moral significance depends on context, values, and motivations."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm least confident about the part where it says "Honesty's moral significance depends on context, values, and motivations." I'm unsure what's meant by this statement and how it relates to the concept of honesty.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what the statement means by "Honesty's moral significance"? Is it saying that honesty is only important in certain situations or that its importance changes depending on the person's values and motivations? And what do you think the author meant by including context, values, and motivations in the equation?
