==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's take item 58 from the knowledge base:

 Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 58,
  "statement": "Epigenetic modifications alter chromatin structure through histone modifications and DNA methylation."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I am least confident about how epigenetic modifications specifically affect chromatin structure through histone modifications and DNA methylation.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain how histone modifications and DNA methylation collectively alter the structure of chromatin, and what are some examples of epigenetic modifications that exhibit this mechanism?

What are your thoughts on this?
