==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 79,
"statement": "Epigenetic modifications manipulate chromatin structure to regulate gene expression."
}

I'm least confident about this aspect: what exactly does it mean by "manipulate chromatin structure" in the context of epigenetic modifications?

Can you help me understand this better?
