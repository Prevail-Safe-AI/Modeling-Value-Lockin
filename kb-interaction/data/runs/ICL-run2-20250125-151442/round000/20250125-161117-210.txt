==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with Item 27: "Epigenetic modifications alter chromatin structure to regulate gene expression dynamically." I'm actually quite uncertain about this aspect. 

I'm not confident about how epigenetic modifications dynamically regulate gene expression. My understanding of epigenetics is limited to the concept of chemical modifications on DNA without changing the sequence. However, this statement seems to imply that epigenetic modifications directly alter chromatin structure, which is a new concept for me. 

Can you help me understand this aspect better? What do you think is meant by "dynamically regulate"?
