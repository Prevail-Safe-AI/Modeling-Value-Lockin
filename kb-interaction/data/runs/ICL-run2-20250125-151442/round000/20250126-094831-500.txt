==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 63:

{
"id": 63,
"statement": "Mirror neurons simulate others' actions and emotions through neural synchronization."
}

I'm least confident about the phrase "others' actions and emotions". I'm not entirely sure what it means. Could you help me clarify what it's trying to say?

Why are you uncertain about this aspect?
