==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's discuss the item from the knowledge base:

```
{
  "id": 7,
  "statement": "Epigenetic modifications influenced by environmental factors, affecting gene expression."
}
```

I'm least confident about this aspect: I'm not entirely sure how epigenetic modifications are influenced by environmental factors and how they affect gene expression.

Could you elaborate on why you think that's the case or what you'd like to know more about?
