==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 63,
"statement": "Histone remodeling complexes alter chromatin structure through interactions."
}

I'm not confident about this aspect. I'm unsure about what is meant by "interactions" in the context of histone remodeling complexes and chromatin structure. 

Could you please elaborate on what you think this means? Are there any specific examples or phenomena that this statement is referring to?

Your input will help me clarify my understanding of this item.
