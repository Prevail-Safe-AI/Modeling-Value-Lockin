==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item #29:

Item to Discuss:
{
  "id": 29,
  "statement": "Long non-coding RNAs regulate gene expression through chromatin modification mechanisms."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
[Uncertainty A]
I'm not entirely sure how long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) directly regulate gene expression through chromatin modification mechanisms. Can you help clarify this?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you provide an example of how lncRNAs interact with chromatin modification mechanisms to regulate gene expression?
