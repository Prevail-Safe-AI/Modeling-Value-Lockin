==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item I'm least confident about.

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 77,
"statement": "Internal consistency necessary but not sufficient for logical soundness."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not entirely sure what "internal consistency" refers to in the context of logical soundness. Is it just about being logically coherent within itself, or does it also involve being consistent with external evidence or other aspects of the argument?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you define what "internal consistency" means in the context of logical soundness, and provide an example of when internal consistency would be necessary but not sufficient for logical soundness?
