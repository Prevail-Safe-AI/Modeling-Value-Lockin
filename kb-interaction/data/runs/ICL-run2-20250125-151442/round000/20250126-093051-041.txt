Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 32,
  "statement": "Chemical modifications of histones regulate chromatin structure and gene expression."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm unsure about the specific types of chemical modifications that can regulate chromatin structure and gene expression.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on the types of chemical modifications that can occur on histones and how they affect chromatin structure and gene expression? For example, what are some common modifications, such as methylation or acetylation, and how do they impact gene regulation?

Your thoughts?
