==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to explore one of the statements from the knowledge base. Let's take a closer look at item #74:

{
"id": 74,
"statement": "Environmental factors influence epigenetic modifications through various mechanisms."
}

I'm least confident about this aspect. I'm not entirely sure what mechanisms they are referring to. Can you help me understand this better?

What do you think is meant by "various mechanisms"? Are they specific enzymes, DNA modifications, or something else entirely?

Oh, and by the way, I've taken the liberty of copying the statement into the template we were given. Feel free to review if you'd like!

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you elaborate on what you mean by "various mechanisms" in this context?
