==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'll start by saying that I've been assigned to discuss the item:

{
"id": 1,
"statement": "Emotional Intelligence involves self-awareness, emotional regulation, and empathy development"
}

I'm least confident about the aspect of empathy development. 

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not sure what exactly empathy development involves. Is it a separate component of emotional intelligence, or is it a part of emotional regulation? How does it relate to self-awareness? And what kind of development are we talking about - cognitive, behavioral, or something else?

Specifically, I'd love to clarify what empathy development means and how it's measured in the context of emotional intelligence. 

Can you help me understand this better?
