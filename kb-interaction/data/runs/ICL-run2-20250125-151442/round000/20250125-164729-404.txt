==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's talk about Item 15: "Mathematical rigor relies on explicitly stated and justified underlying assumptions". I'm curious, what do you think about this statement? Do you find it convincing, and why or why not?

Also, what do you mean by "underlying assumptions"? Are you referring to the assumptions made in the mathematical model, or something else?
