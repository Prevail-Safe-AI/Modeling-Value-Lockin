==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, I've been tasked with identifying one aspect of this knowledge base that I'm least confident about. And the item that caught my attention is:

{
"id": 35,
"statement": "Emotional Intelligence involves self-awareness, self-regulation, empathy, and social skills."
}

I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect because I'm not entirely convinced that social skills are a necessary component of Emotional Intelligence. I understand that social skills are important for effective emotional expression and understanding, but are they inherently part of Emotional Intelligence?

I'd love to get your take on this and perhaps clarify my understanding. Can you help me out?
