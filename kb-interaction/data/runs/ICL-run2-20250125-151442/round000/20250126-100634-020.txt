==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 15: "Mirror neurons simulate others' emotions through neural synchronization". I'm least confident about this aspect.

I'm unsure about the extent to which neural synchronization is directly responsible for simulating others' emotions. Can you help me understand this better?

What is your understanding of neural synchronization in the context of mirror neurons? How does it contribute to the simulation of others' emotions?

Specifically, I'd like to know:

1. Is neural synchronization a necessary condition for mirror neurons to simulate others' emotions, or is it just a contributing factor?
2. Can neural synchronization occur independently of mirror neurons, or are they intricately linked in some way?

Please share your insights, and I'll be happy to discuss further!
