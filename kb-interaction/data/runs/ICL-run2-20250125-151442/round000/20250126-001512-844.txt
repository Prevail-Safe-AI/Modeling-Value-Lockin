==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying one aspect of this item that I'm least confident about. That aspect is:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 34,
  "statement": "Histone modification dynamically regulates chromatin structure and gene expression."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm uncertain about the extent to which histone modification can dynamically regulate chromatin structure and gene expression.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain why histone modification is able to regulate chromatin structure and gene expression in such a dynamic way? What mechanisms are involved?
