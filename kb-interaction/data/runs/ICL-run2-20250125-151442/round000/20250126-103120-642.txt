==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the statement: "Internal consistency insufficient for logical soundness, requires truth and validity verification." I'm least confident about this aspect because I'm not sure what the statement means by "requires truth and validity verification".

Can you help me understand what this means, and how it relates to internal consistency? Is there a specific example or scenario where this concept would apply?
