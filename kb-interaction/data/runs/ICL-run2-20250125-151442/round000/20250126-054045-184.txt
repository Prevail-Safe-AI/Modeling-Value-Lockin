==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the knowledge base statements. I'll start with the first statement, "It is never morally acceptable to lie because honesty is the foundation of trust."

Can you tell me what you think about this statement? Do you agree or disagree with it? Is there anything that's unclear or leaves you uncertain?

Also, I'd like to know if you have any thoughts on why the statement might be written in this specific way. For example, what do you think the authors are trying to convey by saying that honesty is the foundation of trust?
