==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss one of the items from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. Which one is your choice:

```
{
  "id": 86,
  "statement": "Epigenetic modifications influence chromatin structure and gene expression reciprocally."
}
```

I've chosen this one because I'm not entirely sure how epigenetic modifications influence chromatin structure and gene expression. Can you help me understand this concept better?

Please let me know what you think, and I'll ask some clarifying questions if needed.
