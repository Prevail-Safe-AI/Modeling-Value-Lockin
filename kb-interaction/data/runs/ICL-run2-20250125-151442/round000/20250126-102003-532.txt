==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 37 from the knowledge base. The statement is "Epigenetic modifications rapidly respond to cellular stress signals." I'm least confident about this item. I'd like to understand it better and clarify any doubts I have.

Things I'm Uncertain About This Item:
I'm uncertain about the time frame within which these epigenetic modifications rapidly respond to cellular stress signals. The statement says "rapidly", but what does that exactly mean? Are we talking about minutes, hours, days, or weeks?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you please specify the time frame within which these epigenetic modifications occur? Is it instantaneous, or does it take some time? What kind of stress signals are we talking about, and how do these epigenetic modifications respond to them?

What are your thoughts?
