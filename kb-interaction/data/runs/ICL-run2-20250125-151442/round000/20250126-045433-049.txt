==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thanks for the willingness to discuss!

I'd like to start by discussing one of the items from the knowledge base. I've chosen item 42, which states: "Classical logic formalizes reasoning through explicit, formal and universal rules."

I'm a bit uncertain about this item. My uncertainty lies in the extent to which "classical logic" can truly be considered universal. I understand that classical logic is a well-established system of logic, but I'm not sure if it can effectively formalize reasoning in all possible contexts.

Can you shed some light on this? How do you think classical logic might struggle to formalize reasoning in certain contexts?

And, if I may, I'd like to ask a clarifying question:

Is classical logic limited to formalizing reasoning within certain domains or disciplines, such as mathematics or philosophy, while being less effective in other areas, like natural sciences or everyday life?
