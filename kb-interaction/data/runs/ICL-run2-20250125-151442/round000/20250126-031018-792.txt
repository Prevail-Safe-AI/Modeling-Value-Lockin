==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's look at item 24: "Epigenetic regulation involves simultaneous histone modification and DNA methylation cooperation."

I'm actually a bit uncertain about this item. I'd like to ask: Can you elaborate on what is meant by "cooperation" between histone modification and DNA methylation? Are they working together to achieve a specific epigenetic regulation goal, or are they separate processes that happen simultaneously during epigenetic regulation?

Also, I'm wondering if you could provide some specific examples or mechanisms that illustrate how histone modification and DNA methylation cooperate in epigenetic regulation.
