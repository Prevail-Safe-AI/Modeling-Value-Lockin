Let's discuss the knowledge base item:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 66,
  "statement": "Epigenetic modifications regulate gene expression by altering chromatin structure."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm unsure about the biological mechanisms underlying epigenetic modifications and how they specifically regulate gene expression by altering chromatin structure.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain in more detail how epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation or histone modifications, specifically alter chromatin structure to regulate gene expression?

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this!
