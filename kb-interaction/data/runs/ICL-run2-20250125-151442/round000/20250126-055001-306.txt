==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by saying that I'm least confident about the item:

"Epigenetic modifications alter chromatin structure, controlling gene expression."

I'm not entirely sure about the relationship between epigenetic modifications and chromatin structure. Can you elaborate on why epigenetic modifications would alter chromatin structure and how that would, in turn, control gene expression?

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this, and maybe ask some clarifying questions to improve my understanding!
