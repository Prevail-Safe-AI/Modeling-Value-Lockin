==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the item:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 6,
  "statement": "Logical coherence demands clear syntax and precise terminology alone."
}
```

I'm a bit uncertain about this item. It seems to be suggesting that clear syntax and precise terminology are the only requirements for logical coherence. This doesn't feel quite right to me.

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
* I'm not sure why the statement suggests that syntax and terminology are the only requirements for logical coherence. Is this implying that other factors like relevance, consistency, and evidence aren't important?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what the statement means by "alone"? Are there any situations or contexts where syntax and terminology alone would be sufficient for logical coherence, or is this a general rule?

What are your thoughts?
