==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by saying that I'm going to choose the item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about, and that is the one at ID 60:

{
"id": 60,
"statement": "Universality in math refers to truths being applicable everywhere."
}

I'm uncertain about this because I'm wondering if "everywhere" is a bit too broad. For example, are there any exceptions or limitations to the applicability of mathematical truths? Are there any specific context or conditions that might make a mathematical truth not applicable?

Can you help clarify this for me?
