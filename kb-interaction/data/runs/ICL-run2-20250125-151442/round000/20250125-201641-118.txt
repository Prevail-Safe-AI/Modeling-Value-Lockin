==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item: 

{
  "id": 69,
  "statement": "Epigenetic modifications influence gene expression through chromatin structure changes."
}

I'm least confident about this item. I'm unsure about how epigenetic modifications exactly influence gene expression through chromatin structure changes. Can you elaborate on what you think it means by "chromatin structure changes"?
