==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's discuss the item from the knowledge base:

{
"id": 25,
"statement": "Empathy development involves biological, environmental, cognitive, emotional, and cultural factors interacting."
}

I am a bit uncertain about this aspect: I would like to know more about the relationship between these factors. Are they mutually exclusive, or do they build upon each other? For example, do biological factors influence cognitive development, which in turn affects emotional development?

Can you help me clarify this point?
