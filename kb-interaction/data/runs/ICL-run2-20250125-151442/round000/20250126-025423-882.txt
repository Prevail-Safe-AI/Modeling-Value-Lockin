==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been asked to discuss a specific item from the knowledge base, which is:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 25,
  "statement": "Logical coherence requires consistency, soundness, and relevance premises."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm a bit uncertain about how this statement relates to the concept of logical coherence. I understand that logical coherence is about making logical arguments, but I'm not sure how consistency, soundness, and relevance premises relate to each other and to logical coherence.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain how consistency, soundness, and relevance premises contribute to logical coherence? For example, what does it mean for premises to be "sound" and how does that relate to logical coherence?

What are your thoughts on this?
