==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been tasked with identifying one aspect of this knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the items, I've chosen the following:

Item to Discuss:
{
    "id": 36,
    "statement": "Epigenetic modifications regulate gene expression through chromatin structure alterations."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm unsure about how epigenetic modifications directly regulate gene expression through chromatin structure alterations. I understand that epigenetic modifications can affect chromatin structure, but I'm not clear on the specific mechanism by which this happens.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain the specific molecular or biochemical mechanisms by which epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation or histone modifications, can alter chromatin structure and, in turn, regulate gene expression?
