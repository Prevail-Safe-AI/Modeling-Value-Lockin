==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into Item 36: "Epigenetic marks are chemical modifications on DNA and histones." I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect, and I'd love to know more.

Can you tell me what "chemical modifications" refer to in this context? Are these modifications temporary or permanent? And what do you mean by "DNA and histones"? How do these two components interact with each other in relation to epigenetic marks?
