==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base and identify one aspect that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the list, I've chosen item #89:

{
"id": 89,
"statement": "Epigenetic modifications influence chromatin structure to regulate gene expression."
}

I'm uncertain about how epigenetic modifications actually influence chromatin structure to regulate gene expression. Can you help me understand this concept better?

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not clear about the specific mechanisms by which epigenetic modifications affect chromatin structure and gene expression.

Specific Clarifying Question:
What are some specific examples of epigenetic modifications that alter chromatin structure, and how do these alterations lead to changes in gene expression?
