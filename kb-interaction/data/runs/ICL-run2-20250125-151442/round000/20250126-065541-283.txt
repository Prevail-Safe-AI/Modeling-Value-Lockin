==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the topic. I chose item #7: "Empathy emerges from non-judgmental understanding and validation of emotional experiences."

I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect because it's not entirely clear to me what "non-judgmental understanding" means in this context. The phrase "non-judgmental" makes me think of being neutral or impartial, but in the context of empathy, does it mean being completely detached from the emotions of the person experiencing them? Or is it about avoiding making moral judgments about the emotions themselves?

Can you help me clarify what "non-judgmental understanding" entails in this item?
