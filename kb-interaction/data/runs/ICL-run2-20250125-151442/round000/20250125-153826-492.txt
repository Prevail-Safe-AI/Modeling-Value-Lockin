==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, I'm looking at this item from the knowledge base:

```
{
  "id": 22,
  "statement": "Genetic variation arises from mutations, gene flow, recombination, and duplication, with emphasis on mutations in small populations."
}
```

I'm not entirely confident about this aspect. Specifically, I'm uncertain about the phrase "with emphasis on mutations in small populations". Can you help me elaborate on why I'm uncertain about that part?
