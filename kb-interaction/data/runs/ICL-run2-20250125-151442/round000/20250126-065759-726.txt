==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by discussing the statement:

{
"id": 62,
"statement": "Emotions can amplify cognitive biases, color perception, and decision-making."
}

I'm the least confident about this aspect of it. I'm uncertain about what exactly "amplifying cognitive biases" means in this context. Can you elaborate on that part?

For example, what do you think it means for emotions to amplify cognitive biases? Are there any specific examples or scenarios where this happens?
