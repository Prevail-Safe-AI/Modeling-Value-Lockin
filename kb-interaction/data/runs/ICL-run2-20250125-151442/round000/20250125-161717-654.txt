==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into it. I'm supposed to identify one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. And the item is:

{
"id": 53,
"statement": "Proof by contradiction assumes opposite to derive logical inconsistency."
}

I'm a bit uncertain about this item because... 

I think I'm confused about what exactly is meant by "derive logical inconsistency". In my mind, I associate proof by contradiction with assuming the opposite of a statement and showing that it leads to a logical contradiction, but I'm not entirely sure how that specifically translates to "derive logical inconsistency". Am I on the right track here, or is there more to this statement than what I'm assuming?

Can you shed some light on this for me? Do you have any insights as to what this statement might be getting at?
