==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item I'm least confident about, which is:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 97,
"statement": "Logical coherence requires clear syntax, precise terminology, and consistent structure for soundness."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm unsure about the relationship between the conditions mentioned in the statement (clear syntax, precise terminology, and consistent structure) and the concept of soundness. I'm not clear how these conditions ensure soundness. Can you help me understand this better?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain how these conditions are related to soundness, and how they contribute to the overall coherence of an argument?

Please let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss this further!
