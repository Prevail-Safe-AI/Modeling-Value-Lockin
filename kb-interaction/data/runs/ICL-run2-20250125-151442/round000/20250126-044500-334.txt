==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'd like to discuss item 14:

{
"id": 14,
"statement": "Epigenetic marks influence gene expression through chromatin structure modifications."
}

Items 14 and 15 are very similar, and I'm least confident about the accuracy of this statement. I'm not entirely sure how epigenetic marks influence gene expression through chromatin structure modifications.

Can you elaborate on why you think this statement is true? What are some key mechanisms or processes involved?

(Note: I'm prepared to learn and adjust my understanding based on your response!)
