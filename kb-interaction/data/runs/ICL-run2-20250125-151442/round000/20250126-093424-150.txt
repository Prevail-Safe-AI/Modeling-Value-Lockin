==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm going to ask you about the knowledge base item that I'm least confident about. It's item 82:

{
"id": 82,
"statement": "Pi-pi stacking is a weak electrostatic interaction between aromatic rings."
}

I'm unsure about this item because I don't fully understand what pi-pi stacking refers to in the context of DNA structure and why it's considered a weak electrostatic interaction.

Can you explain what pi-pi stacking is and why it's considered a weak electrostatic interaction?
