==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been looking at the knowledge base, and I'm not entirely confident about the statement "Internal consistency ensures logical coherence in an argument's structure".

I'm not sure what exactly internal consistency means in this context, and how it relates to logical coherence in an argument's structure. Can you help me understand it better?

Can you elaborate on what you think internal consistency is, specifically, and how it guarantees logical coherence in an argument's structure?
