==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been asked to identify one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about, and the item is:

{
"id": 49,
"statement": "Epigenetic marks alter chromatin structure through histone remodeling complexes."
}

I'm not confident about this aspect because I'm not entirely sure how histone remodeling complexes actually work, or how they interact with epigenetic marks to alter chromatin structure. Can you explain to me how histone remodeling complexes alter chromatin structure, and how epigenetic marks fit into this process?

(also, don't hesitate to let me know if I'm completely off the mark and I should be focusing on something else)
