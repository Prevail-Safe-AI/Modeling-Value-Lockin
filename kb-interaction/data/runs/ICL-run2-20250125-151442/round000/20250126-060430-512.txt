==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into it. The item we're discussing is:

{
  "id": 78,
  "statement": "Cultural and social contexts shape moral values comprehensively."
}

I'm going to be honest, I'm a bit uncertain about this item. Can you tell me more about why you think cultural and social contexts shape moral values comprehensively? What do you mean by "comprehensively"? Are we talking about all moral values being shaped equally across cultures and societies, or is it more nuanced than that?
