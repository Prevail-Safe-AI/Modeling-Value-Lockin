==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's focus on the item I'm least confident about, which is:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 59,
  "statement": "Chromatin structure refers to complex of DNA, histones, and non-histone proteins."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not entirely sure what constitutes the "complex" of chromatin structure. What specifically does that refer to?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you help me understand what non-histone proteins are involved in chromatin structure and how they interact with histones and DNA?
