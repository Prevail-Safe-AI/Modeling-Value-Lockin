==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item I'd like to discuss. It's:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 95,
  "statement": "Validating others' emotions means acknowledging and accepting feelings as normal."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm uncertain about whether this statement fully captures the concept of validating others' emotions. I'm not confident that acknowledging and accepting feelings as normal is the only, or even the best, way to validate someone's emotions.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what you think this statement means, and do you think it's a sufficient definition of validating others' emotions?

Your thoughts?
