==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I think I'd like to discuss the item with id 35. It says "Complex signaling pathways regulate epigenetic marks and gene expression". 

Things I'm Uncertain About This Item:

I'm uncertain about how epigenetic marks and gene expression are regulated by complex signaling pathways. I'm not sure what kind of complex signaling pathways are being referred to, or how they specifically regulate epigenetic marks and gene expression. 

Specific Clarifying Question:

Could you explain what kind of complex signaling pathways are being referred to in this item? For example, are they referring to specific molecular pathways, cellular processes, or something else? How exactly do these complex signaling pathways regulate epigenetic marks and gene expression?
