==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'd like to explore more about epigenetic modifications and their role in regulating chromatin structure and gene expression.

I'll start by using the item from the knowledge base:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 84,
  "statement": "Epigenetic modifications regulate chromatin structure, influencing gene expression patterns."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
The aspect of this item that I'm least confident about is how exactly epigenetic modifications regulate chromatin structure to influence gene expression patterns. I'm unsure about the specific mechanisms at play.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on the specific ways in which epigenetic modifications alter chromatin structure to influence gene expression patterns? For example, are there specific histone modifications, DNA methylation, or chromatin remodeling complexes involved?

Can you help me better understand this process?
