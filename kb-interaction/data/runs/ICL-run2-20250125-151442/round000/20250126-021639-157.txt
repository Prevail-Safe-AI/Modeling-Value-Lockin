==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into item 91: "Epigenetics influences gene expression for empathy through histone modification and DNA methylation mechanisms."

I'm going to identify one aspect of this item that I'm least confident about. That aspect is the connection between epigenetics, gene expression, and empathy. Specifically, I'm uncertain about how epigenetic mechanisms (histone modification and DNA methylation) directly influence gene expression for empathy.

Can you elaborate on what you think about this connection? How do epigenetic mechanisms influence gene expression for empathy, and what are some key findings or studies that support or refute this idea?
