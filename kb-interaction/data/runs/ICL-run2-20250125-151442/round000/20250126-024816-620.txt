==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss aspect 97 from the knowledge base:

{
"id": 97,
"statement": "Histone modification alters chromatin structure and transcription factor binding."
}

I'm a little uncertain about this item. I'd like to know more about what histone modification entails and how it affects transcription factor binding. 

Can you help me understand how chromatin structure relates to gene expression?
