==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. And that is:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 90,
  "statement": "Holistic validation ensures logical coherence through interconnected components harmony."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not entirely sure what the author means by "holistic validation" in this context. Specifically, I'm unclear on what they mean by "interconnected components" and how harmony between them contributes to logical coherence.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you please elaborate on what you mean by "holistic validation" and how it relates to the concept of logical coherence in this statement?
