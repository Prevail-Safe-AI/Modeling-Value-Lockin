==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, I'm looking at the knowledge base, and I'm going to choose one aspect that I'm least confident about. I've selected item 54:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 54,
"statement": "Dynamic histone modification regulates gene expression through adaptability."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

I'm not entirely sure what "adaptability" means in this context. How can histone modification be adaptable? Is it referring to the ability of the cell to adjust its gene expression in response to changing conditions?

Can you help me clarify this concept?
