==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, we're going to discuss item 53 from the knowledge base:

{
"id": 53,
"statement": "Honesty is the foundation of trust, building consistency and predictability."
}

I'm feeling uncertain about this aspect. I'm not entirely convinced that honesty is always the foundation of trust. In what situations do you think this statement might not apply, and why?

Can you help me understand this better?
