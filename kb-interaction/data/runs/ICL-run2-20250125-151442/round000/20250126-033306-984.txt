==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'm going to choose item 74:

```
{
  "id": 74,
  "statement": "Soundness in logical coherence requires validity, truth, consistency, and relevance."
}
```

I'm least confident about this item because I'm not entirely sure what "relevance" refers to in this context. Is it referring to the relevance of the evidence presented in an argument? Or is it about how the argument relates to the topic or audience?

Can you help me understand what you think "relevance" means in this statement? And do you agree or disagree with the statement as a whole?
