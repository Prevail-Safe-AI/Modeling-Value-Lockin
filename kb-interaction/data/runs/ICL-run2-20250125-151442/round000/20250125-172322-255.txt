==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's go through the task. We need to identify one aspect of the item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. I've chosen the item:

```
{
  "id": 12,
  "statement": "Mathematical truths are objective, universally applicable, and independent"
}
```

I'm uncertain about the independence part of the statement.
