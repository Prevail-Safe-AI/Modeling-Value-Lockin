==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 76,
"statement": "Epigenetic drift occurs through histone modification-DNA methylation interplay"
}

I'm a bit uncertain about this item, specifically the concept of "epigenetic drift". Can you help me understand what it means and how it relates to histone modification and DNA methylation?
