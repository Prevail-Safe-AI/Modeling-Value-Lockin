==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 92, which states: "Epigenetic machinery regulates gene expression in response to stress signals." I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect.

I'm unclear about what is meant by "epigenetic machinery" in this context. Could you elaborate on what exactly that refers to? Is it a specific group of proteins, enzymes, or something more general?
