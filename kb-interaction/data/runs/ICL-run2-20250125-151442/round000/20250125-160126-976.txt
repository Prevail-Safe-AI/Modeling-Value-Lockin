==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by discussing item 12: "Animal welfare evaluated through behavioral and physiological indicators."

I'm least confident about this item because I'm not sure what exactly constitutes behavioral and physiological indicators for animal welfare. Could you elaborate on what these indicators are and how they're used to evaluate animal welfare?

Please share your thoughts!
