==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'll pick the item I'm the least confident about, which is:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 96,
  "statement": "Systematic methodology minimizes biases and ensures reliable results."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

I'm unclear about the extent to which a systematic methodology can eliminate biases entirely. Can systematic methodology really guarantee reliable results, or are there potential caveats or limitations that I'm missing?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what you mean by "systematic methodology" in this context, and how it can ensure reliable results in the face of potential biases?

What do you think?
