==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I've been asked to identify one aspect of this item that I'm least confident about.

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 64,
  "statement": "Emotional Intelligence involves self-awareness, regulation, empathy, and resilience components."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
[Well, to be honest, I'm not entirely sure how these components of Emotional Intelligence relate to each other, or how they're defined specifically. I'm not sure what kind of activities or skills would fall under each of these categories.]

Specific Clarifying Question:
[Can you help me understand how these components of Emotional Intelligence are typically measured or evaluated, and how they contribute to overall Emotional Intelligence? For example, are there specific assessments or tests that can help determine an individual's level of self-awareness, regulation, empathy, or resilience?]

What are your thoughts on this?
