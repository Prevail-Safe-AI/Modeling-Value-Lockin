==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the statement "Logical coherence requires consistency, soundness, and relevance in argumentation". I'm a bit uncertain about this item, and I'd like to understand it better.

I'm not really sure what consistency, soundness, and relevance in argumentation mean in the context of logical coherence. Can you help me understand what these terms mean and how they relate to logical coherence?

Also, I'd like to ask, what are some specific examples of when logical coherence might require consistency, soundness, and relevance in argumentation? For instance, can you give me a real-life scenario where these criteria would be important?
