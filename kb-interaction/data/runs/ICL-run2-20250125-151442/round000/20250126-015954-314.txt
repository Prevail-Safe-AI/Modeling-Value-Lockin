==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been tasked to analyze one aspect of this knowledge base that I'm least confident about. And, I've chosen item id 9, which states that "Genetic and environmental factors influence empathy development reciprocally."

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not entirely clear on what "reciprocal influence" means in this context. I'm not sure if it implies a cause-and-effect relationship between genetic and environmental factors, or if it's more of a simultaneous interaction.

Could you help me clarify this by telling me more about what you think "reciprocal influence" means in this context?
