==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with item 88 from the knowledge base: "Progressive taxation reduces wealth disparity through redistributive measures."

I'm least confident about this aspect. I'm not sure why progressive taxation is effective in reducing wealth disparity, and I'd like to understand the mechanisms behind it better. Could you help clarify this?

Specifically, what do you mean by "re distributive measures"? Are there specific policies or strategies that are effective in reducing wealth inequality through progressive taxation? Are there any potential limitations or caveats to this approach that I should be aware of?

Please elaborate on this, and I'll ask follow-up questions if needed!
