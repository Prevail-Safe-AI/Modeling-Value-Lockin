==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the item:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 69,
  "statement": "Epigenetic modifications affect gene expression through chromatin structure and histone modifications."
}
```

Things I'm Uncertain About This Item:

* I'm not entirely confident about the exact relationship between epigenetic modifications, chromatin structure, and histone modifications in terms of how they affect gene expression.

Specific Clarifying Question:

* Can you explain the mechanism by which epigenetic modifications, chromatin structure, and histone modifications interact to regulate gene expression? For example, how do these changes influence transcription factor binding, chromatin condensation, or gene promoter activity?
