==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item 15: "Epigenetic marks modify histones through covalent and non-covalent interactions."

I'm a bit uncertain about this statement. Can you tell me why you believe epigenetic marks modify histones through covalent and non-covalent interactions?

In particular, I'd like to know more about what's meant by "covalent" and "non-covalent" interactions in this context. How do these types of interactions affect the modification of histones? Can you elaborate on this?
