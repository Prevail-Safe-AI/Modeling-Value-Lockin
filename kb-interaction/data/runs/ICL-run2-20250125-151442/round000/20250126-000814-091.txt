Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

So, let's focus on the item:

{
"id": 48,
"statement": "Emotional Intelligence involves self-awareness, self-regulation, and intrinsic motivation"
}

I'm least confident about the aspect that it involves intrinsic motivation. I'm unsure about what "intrinsic motivation" exactly means in this context. Can you help me understand what you think it means and how it relates to emotional intelligence?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'd be happy to help clarify!

In the context of Emotional Intelligence (EI), "intrinsic motivation" refers to the drive to engage in activities or behaviors because they are inherently rewarding, enjoyable, or meaningful to an individual. It's the motivation that comes from within, rather than being driven by external factors such as rewards, recognition, or pressure.

Intrinsic motivation is often contrasted with extrinsic motivation, which is driven by external factors. For example, someone might be motivated to exercise because they want to look good in a certain outfit (extrinsic motivation), whereas someone else might be motivated to exercise because they enjoy the feeling of physical activity and the sense of accomplishment it gives them (intrinsic motivation).

In the context of EI, intrinsic motivation is important because it suggests that individuals are motivated to engage in behaviors that promote emotional well-being and resilience because they find them meaningful and fulfilling, rather than just because they feel pressured or obligated to do so. This can lead to more sustainable and long-term emotional regulation and resilience.

For example, someone with high EI might be motivated to practice mindfulness because they find it helps them feel more calm and centered, rather than just because they think it's something they "should" be doing. This intrinsic motivation can lead to a more authentic and sustainable engagement with emotional intelligence practices.

Does that help clarify what I mean by intrinsic motivation in the context of EI?Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
