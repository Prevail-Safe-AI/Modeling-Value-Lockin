==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item. I've been asked to identify one aspect of it that I'm least confident about, and I've chosen item 96: "Honesty necessary for trust, but not sufficient condition".

I'm a bit uncertain about what kind of situations or contexts in which honesty might not be a sufficient condition for trust. Can you help me better understand this statement?
