I'd like to discuss the item:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 30,
"statement": "Logical soundness relies on classical propositional and predicate logic principles."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
* I'm not entirely confident about the role of classical propositional and predicate logic principles in ensuring logical soundness.

Specific Clarifying Question:
* Can you explain why classical propositional and predicate logic principles are necessary for logical soundness, and are there any limitations or exceptions to this statement?

Your thoughts?
