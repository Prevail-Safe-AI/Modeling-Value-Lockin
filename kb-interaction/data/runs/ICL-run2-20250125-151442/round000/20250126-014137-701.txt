==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 21,
"statement": "Self-awareness and regulation are interdependent, influencing each other."
}

As I read this statement, I'm least confident about the following aspect:

"I'm unsure about how exactly self-awareness and regulation are interdependent and influence each other. The statement seems to imply a cause-and-effect relationship, but I'm not clear what mechanisms are at play."

Can you elaborate on your thoughts about this item? Do you have any insights on how self-awareness and regulation are related?
