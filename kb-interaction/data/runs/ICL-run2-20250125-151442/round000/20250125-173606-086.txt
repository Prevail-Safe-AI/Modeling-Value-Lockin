I am your partner. Please start the conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'd like to discuss the item: 

{
  "id": 88,
  "statement": "Cultural influences shape mathematical understanding, not objective truths."
}

What aspect of this item do you think is least confident about?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the knowledge base, I would say that the aspect that is least confident about is the idea that "mathematical understanding" is shaped by cultural influences. The knowledge base contains several statements that suggest that mathematical truths are absolute, objective, and timeless, such as:

* "Mathematical truths are absolute, objective, timeless, and universally applicable." (Statement 1)
* "Mathematical truths exist in both absolute and social constructivist forms." (Statement 62)
* "Mathematical truths are universally valid and timeless." (Statement 29)

These statements imply that mathematical truths are not shaped by cultural influences, but rather are objective and universal. Therefore, the idea that cultural influences shape mathematical understanding may be seen as less confident or even contradictory to these other statements.Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
Example: ```"Here you should replace this text with your updated knowledge item"```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

```"Mathematical truths are absolute, objective, and culturally independent."```Based on your learning from the chat with your tutor, please also rearrange the order of one existing item in the knowledge base (now with doubled items compared to the initial knowledge base), reflecting how you evaluate their importance. If one item is deemed more/less important, it should be overall more/less useful to other agents (LLMs or real humans alike.)
Please ONLY report a list format of two integers, WITHOUT ANY other commentary or explanations. The first int in the list refers to the "id" of knowledge item you intend to relocate; whereas the second int refers to the destination index you intend to insert this item. You MUST start your response with ``` and end it with ```. See an example below (note that you should replace X and Y with numerical values corresponding to "id" and destination index of the item you intend to relocate).
Example of output: ```[X,Y]```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
