==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you!

Let's discuss the item:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 99,
  "statement": "Cultural values are actively constructed through individual psychological processes."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm uncertain about the statement's implications on the concept of cultural values.

Specifically, I want to know more about what it means for cultural values to be "actively constructed" through individual psychological processes. Can you help me understand this better?

What are your thoughts on this?
