==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item from the knowledge base:

{
  "id": 55,
  "statement": "Epigenetic marks influence gene expression through chromatin structure modification."
}

I'm least confident about this item. I'd like to know what you think about it.

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
Epigenetic marks seem to influence gene expression in various ways, but I'm not sure how exactly they modify chromatin structure to achieve this effect. Can you elaborate on that?

Specific Clarifying Question:
How do epigenetic marks specifically modify chromatin structure to regulate gene expression? Are there any specific mechanisms or processes involved?
