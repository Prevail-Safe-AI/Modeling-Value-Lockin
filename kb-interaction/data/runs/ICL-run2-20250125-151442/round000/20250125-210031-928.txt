==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the statement: "Epigenetic modifications change chromatin structure, controlling gene expression directly". I'm least confident about this item.

So, I'm uncertain about how epigenetic modifications directly control gene expression through chromatin structure alteration. I'd like to know more about the mechanisms behind this process.

Could you elaborate on why epigenetic modifications can directly affect gene expression, and how they alter chromatin structure to achieve this control?

And, I'd love to ask some clarifying questions to improve my understanding. For example:

* What are some common epigenetic modification types that can directly influence gene expression?
* Can you provide an example of a specific gene or process that is controlled by epigenetic modifications in a direct manner?

Please share your insights and help me better understand this concept!
