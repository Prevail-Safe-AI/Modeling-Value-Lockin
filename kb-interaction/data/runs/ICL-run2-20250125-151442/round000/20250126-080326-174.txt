==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's take the item: "Logical relevance ensures effective argumentation and coherence in discussions." (id 85)

I'm a bit uncertain about this item. One thing I'm unsure about is how "logical relevance" is defined in this context. Is it just about making sure that the arguments and claims being discussed are related to the topic, or is there something more to it?

Can you elaborate on what you think "logical relevance" entails in this context? And what specifically makes you think that it ensures effective argumentation and coherence in discussions?
