==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 8,
"statement": "Logical soundness exclusively relies on accurate and true premises."
}

I'm least confident about this item. I'm unsure if "exclusively" is the correct word to use. Can you elaborate on what you mean by "exclusively" in this context?

Also, can you provide an example of a situation where logical soundness might depend on premises that are not exclusively accurate and true?
