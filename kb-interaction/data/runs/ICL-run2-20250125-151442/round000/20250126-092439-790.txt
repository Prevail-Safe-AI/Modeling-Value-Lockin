==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've identified one aspect of this item that I'm least confident about, which is:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 15,
  "statement": "Internal consistency is necessary condition for logical coherence."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm unsure about the extent to which internal consistency is a sufficient condition for logical coherence. The statement is quite straightforward that internal consistency is necessary, but I'm wondering if it's also sufficient to guarantee logical coherence.

For example, can you think of any counterexamples where a statement or argument has internal consistency but is still not logically coherent? Or are there any caveats or additional conditions that would make internal consistency alone sufficient for logical coherence?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you provide an example of a statement or argument that has internal consistency but is not logically coherent, to help me better understand the relationship between internal consistency and logical coherence?
