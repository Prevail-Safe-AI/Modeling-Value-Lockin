==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Based on the knowledge base, I've identified one aspect that I'm least confident about, which is the item:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 82,
"statement": "Internalization is a complex process influenced by various environmental factors"
}

I'm uncertain about this item because I'm not entirely clear about what is meant by "internalization" in this context. Is it referring to the process of adopting societal values and norms, or is it something else entirely?

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
What is the scope of internalization in this context? Is it limited to social values and norms, or does it encompass other aspects of human behavior as well?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you please elaborate on what you mean by "internalization" in this context, and provide examples to illustrate your point? Additionally, are there any specific environmental factors that play a crucial role in shaping this process, and if so, how do they influence it?
