==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's discuss the item from the knowledge base:

{
  "id": 13,
  "statement": "Trust involves empathy: understanding and sharing felt emotions."
}

I'm least confident about this aspect. I'm not sure if trust truly relies on empathy alone. Can you elaborate on why you think trust involves empathy?
