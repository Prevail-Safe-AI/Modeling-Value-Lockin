==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the statement "Honesty's importance varies depending on context and values."

I'm a bit uncertain about this item because I'm not sure how to define "context" and "values" in this context. Can you help me clarify what kind of context and values are referred to here?

And also, how do you think people can agree on what situations honesty is more or less important in? For example, is honesty always more important than empathy or understanding in extreme situations?
