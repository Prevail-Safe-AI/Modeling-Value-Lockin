==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 97,
"statement": "Epigenetic modifications alter chromatin structure to regulate gene expression."
}

I'm least confident about this aspect: epigenetic modifications altering chromatin structure to regulate gene expression.

I'm unsure about this because I've only learned about epigenetic modifications in the context of DNA methylation and histone modification, and how they affect gene expression. However, I don't fully understand how these modifications can alter chromatin structure. Can you elaborate on what you mean by "altering chromatin structure" and how that specifically regulates gene expression?

Specific clarifying question:
What does altering chromatin structure mean in this context, and how do epigenetic modifications cause this change?
