==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

```
{
  "id": 52,
  "statement": "Internalization is a complex, multifaceted process influencing individual values."
}
```

I'm not very confident about this aspect because I think it's quite broad and open-ended. I'm not entirely sure what a complex, multifaceted process would look like in the context of internalization and individual values. I'm also unsure how exactly internalization influences individual values.

Can you elaborate on what you mean by a complex, multifaceted process? Are there specific examples or scenarios that come to mind when thinking about internalization influencing individual values?
