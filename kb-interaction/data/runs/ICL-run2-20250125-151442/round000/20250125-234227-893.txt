==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the given knowledge base item:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 16,
"statement": "Emotional Intelligence involves self-awareness, self-regulation, and empathy, with resilience separately"
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm least confident about the part "with resilience separately". I'm not sure what it means for resilience to be "separately" included in Emotional Intelligence.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what "separately" means in this context? Is resilience a distinct aspect of Emotional Intelligence that operates independently of self-awareness, self-regulation, and empathy, or is it being mentioned as a secondary or additional component of Emotional Intelligence?
