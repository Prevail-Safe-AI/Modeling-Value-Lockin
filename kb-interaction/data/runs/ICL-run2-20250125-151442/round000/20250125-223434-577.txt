==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been tasked to identify one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about.

The item is:

```
{
  "id": 98,
  "statement": "Epigenetic modifications alter chromatin structure through histone modifications interactions"
}
```

Upon reviewing the statement, I'm uncertain about the phrase "histone modifications interactions". I'm not entirely clear what "histone modifications interactions" refer to or how they specifically contribute to epigenetic modifications altering chromatin structure.

Can you help shed some light on this part of the statement?
