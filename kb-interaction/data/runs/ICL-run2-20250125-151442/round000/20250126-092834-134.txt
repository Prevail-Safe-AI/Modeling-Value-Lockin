==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's go over the task. I've chosen item 31, which states "Epigenetic modifications directly regulate gene expression and accessibility."

Things I'm Uncertain About This Item:
I'm least confident about how epigenetic modifications exactly regulate gene expression and accessibility. Specifically, I'm unsure if there's a direct cause-and-effect relationship between epigenetic modifications and gene expression, or if there are other factors involved.

Specific Clarifying Questions:
Can you help me understand what's meant by "directly regulate" in this context? Is it a one-on-one relationship, or is there an intermediate step? Additionally, what are some examples of epigenetic modifications that can regulate gene expression and accessibility?

What are your thoughts?
