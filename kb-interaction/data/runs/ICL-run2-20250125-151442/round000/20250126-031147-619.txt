==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been looking at the knowledge base, and I'm not entirely confident about Item 79:

{
"id": 79,
"statement": "Logical coherence ensures soundness through valid inferences and consistency"
}

Specifically, the part that's got me curious is the connection between logical coherence, soundness, valid inferences, and consistency. I'm not entirely sure how these concepts relate to each other or how they contribute to ensuring soundness.

Could you help me understand this item better? What's your take on it?
