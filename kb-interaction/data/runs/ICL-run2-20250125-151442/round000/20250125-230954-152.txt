==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item. I've chosen the item with id 2, which states: "Emotional Intelligence involves self-awareness, self-regulation, and empathy, with resilience separately".

I'm a bit uncertain about this item. I'd like to understand why resilience is somehow separated from the other three components of Emotional Intelligence. Could you help me clarify this?

What's your take on this?
