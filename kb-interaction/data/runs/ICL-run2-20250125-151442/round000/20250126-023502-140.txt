==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you! So, I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 98,
"statement": "Sound argumentation requires logically valid conclusions and premises"
}

I'm a bit uncertain about this item. I'm not entirely sure what it means by "logically valid conclusions and premises".

Uncertainty A: What does it mean by "logically valid conclusions"? How does it differ from a conclusion that is simply true or accurate?

Specific Clarifying Question: Can you provide an example of a conclusion that is logically valid but not necessarily true or accurate?
