==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to know about the item: 

```
{
  "id": 13,
  "statement": "Logical coherence emerges from harmonious integration of validity, relevance, and consistency."
}
```

I'm a bit uncertain about how "harmonious integration" is meant in this context. Can you elaborate on what you think it means and how it relates to logical coherence?

(Also, just to clarify, we're assuming that the knowledge base we've been provided is the only source of information.)
