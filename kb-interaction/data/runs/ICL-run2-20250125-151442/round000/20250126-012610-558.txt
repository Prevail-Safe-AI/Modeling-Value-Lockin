==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into it!

I've chosen the item:

{
"id": 69,
"statement": "Emotional Intelligence is a complex, interconnected dynamic system."
}

I'm least confident about the aspect that it's a "dynamic system". What does it mean for Emotional Intelligence to be a dynamic system? Is it referring to the way it changes and adapts over time, or is it something else entirely?

Can you shed some light on this aspect?
