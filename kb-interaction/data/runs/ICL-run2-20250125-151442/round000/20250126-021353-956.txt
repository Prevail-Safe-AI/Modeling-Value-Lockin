==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Before we dive in, I'd like to identify one aspect of the item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. And that is:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 14,
  "statement": "Empathy development involves intricate interplay of genetic, environmental, and cognitive factors."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not entirely sure what's meant by "intricate interplay". Can you help me understand what this refers to? Is it a specific mechanism or process?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you provide an example of what this "intricate interplay" might look like in real-life situations? For instance, how do genetic, environmental, and cognitive factors interact with each other to shape empathy development?

Please let me know what you think, and we can go from there!
