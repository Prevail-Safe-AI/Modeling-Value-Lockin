==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you!

Let's dive into the knowledge base item I'm least confident about, which is:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 62,
  "statement": "Electrostatic attraction plays a secondary role in DNA stabilization."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

I'm uncertain about the role of electrostatic attraction in DNA stabilization. I'm not sure what is meant by "secondary role".

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what is meant by "secondary role" in this context? Is electrostatic attraction still playing a significant role or is it playing a minimal or minor role in DNA stabilization? And how does the strength of electrostatic attraction versus other forces (like π-π stacking and hydrogen bonding) contribute to DNA stabilization?
