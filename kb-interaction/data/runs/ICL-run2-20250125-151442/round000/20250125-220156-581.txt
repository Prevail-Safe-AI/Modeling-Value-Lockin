==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to focus on the statement "Lying can be morally justifiable in extreme context-dependent situations." I have to admit that I'm not confident about this aspect. 

Things I'm Uncertain About This Item:

* The definition of "extreme context-dependent situations" is unclear to me. What does that mean exactly?
* How can lying ever be morally justifiable? Isn't honesty always the best policy?

Specific Clarifying Question:

* Can you provide examples of situations where lying might be morally justifiable, and how does it differ from situations where lying would be morally wrong? How do we determine what's an "extreme context-dependent situation"?
