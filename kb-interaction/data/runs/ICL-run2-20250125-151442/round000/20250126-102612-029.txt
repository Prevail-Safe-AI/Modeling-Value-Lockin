==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item. I'm going to select one aspect of this knowledge base item that I'm least confident about. I've chosen the following item:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 19,
  "statement": "Epigenetic modifications influence gene expression through chromatin structure changes."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

I'm uncertain about how epigenetic modifications exactly influence gene expression through chromatin structure changes. For instance, what are the underlying mechanisms that mediate this influence?

Specific Clarifying Question:

Can you clarify the specific ways in which epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation or histone modification, affect chromatin structure and, in turn, influence gene expression?
