==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the given item from the knowledge base:

```
{
  "id": 33,
  "statement": "Logical soundness requires harmony among truth, validity, and consistency."
}
```

I'm least confident about this item. I'd like to elaborate on what I'm uncertain about.

I'm uncertain about how "harmony" is defined in this context. What does it mean for truth, validity, and consistency to be in harmony with each other? Is it a strict requirement that all three must always be in complete harmony, or is it possible for them to be in harmony in certain situations? Specifically, what happens if there's a trade-off between one of these criteria and the others?

Can you help me understand this better?
