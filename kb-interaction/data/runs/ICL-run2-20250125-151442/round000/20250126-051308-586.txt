==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

```
{
  "id": 34,
  "statement": "Honesty's meaning varies across cultures and relationships socially dependent"
}
```

I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect. Can you elaborate on why you think honesty's meaning varies across cultures and relationships? What specific examples or research findings might support this idea?
