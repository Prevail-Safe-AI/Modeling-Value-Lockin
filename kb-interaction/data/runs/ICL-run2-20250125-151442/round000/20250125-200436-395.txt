==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by saying that I've been asked to evaluate this knowledge base and discuss a specific item. After reviewing the item, I'm going to focus on item 81:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 81,
  "statement": "Emotional intelligence involves recognizing own emotions' impact on others'"
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:  

Well, I'm least confident about the connection between emotional intelligence and recognizing one's own emotions' impact on others. I'm wondering if this statement is unequivocally true.

Can you help me clarify this by explaining why you think this connection is important or if you have any doubts about it?

Also, I was wondering if you could help me understand what exactly is meant by "recognizing one's own emotions' impact on others." Do you have any insight on how to operationalize this concept?

And finally, are there any counterarguments or limitations to this statement that I should be aware of?
