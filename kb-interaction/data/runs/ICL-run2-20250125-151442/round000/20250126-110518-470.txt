==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the item: {
  "id": 64,
  "statement": "Logical soundness requires truth, validity, and consistency together."
}

I'm going to admit that I'm least confident about this aspect. I'm unsure about what "requires" means in this context. Does it mean that all three conditions (truth, validity, and consistency) are necessary, but sufficient, for logical soundness? Or does it mean that all three conditions are necessary, but together they're still not sufficient, and there are other factors involved?

Could you help me clarify this?
