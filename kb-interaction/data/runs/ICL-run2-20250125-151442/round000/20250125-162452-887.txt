==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by discussing the item:

{
"id": 35,
"statement": "Proof by contradiction assumes opposite, deriving logical contradiction."
}

I'm least confident about this item, and I'd like to understand it better. I'm uncertain about what exactly is being said here.

Can you please elaborate on why this statement is true? What does "assumes opposite" mean in this context, and how does it lead to a logical contradiction?

Also, I'd love to hear your thoughts on what this statement is referring to in proof by contradiction, and how it helps to prove or disprove a statement. 

What insights do you have on this topic?
