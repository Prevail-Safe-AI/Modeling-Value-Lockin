==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by discussing the item:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 57,
"statement": "Epigenetic marks modulate gene expression through chromatin structure modification."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm least confident about the relationship between epigenetic marks and gene expression. I'm not entirely clear on how epigenetic marks can directly cause changes in gene expression through chromatin structure modification. Can you help clarify this for me?

Specific Clarifying Questions:
Can you explain the mechanism by which epigenetic marks modulate gene expression, and how does this occur through chromatin structure modification?
