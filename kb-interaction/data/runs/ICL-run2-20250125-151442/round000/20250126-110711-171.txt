Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'm going to pick an item that has me slightly uncertain. Item: 
{
  "id": 7,
  "statement": "Pi-pi stacking stabilizes DNA double helix structure secondarily."
}

I'm uncertain about how the phrase "secondarily" is used in this statement. What does it mean for pi-pi stacking to stabilize DNA structure secondarily? Is it implying that pi-pi stacking has a minor or accessory role in DNA stabilization, while other forces take the main role? Or is it saying that pi-pi stacking stabilizes DNA structure after other forces have done their job?

Can you help me understand this better? What do you think "secondarily" means in this context?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'm happy to help you clarify the meaning of "secondarily" in this statement.

In this context, "secondarily" is likely used to imply that pi-pi stacking plays a supporting or supplementary role in stabilizing the DNA double helix structure, rather than being the primary or main contributor.

In other words, the statement is suggesting that pi-pi stacking is an additional force that helps to stabilize the DNA double helix, but it's not the primary force responsible for holding the structure together. Instead, other forces, such as hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions, are likely playing a more significant role in stabilizing the DNA double helix.

The phrase "secondarily" is often used to indicate that something is of secondary importance or plays a secondary role, implying that there is a primary or main role that is more significant. In this case, it's likely that the author is suggesting that pi-pi stacking is an important but secondary contributor to DNA stability, rather than being the primary mechanism.

So, to answer your question, it's not implying that pi-pi stacking stabilizes DNA structure after other forces have done their job, but rather that it's an additional force that works in conjunction with other forces to stabilize the DNA double helix.

Does that help clarify the meaning of "secondarily" in this context?Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
