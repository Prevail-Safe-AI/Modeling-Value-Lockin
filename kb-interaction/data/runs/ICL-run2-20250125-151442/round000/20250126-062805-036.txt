==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the knowledge base statement:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 27,
  "statement": "Logical coherence emerges from harmonious combination of validity, relevance, consistency."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm unsure about what is meant by "harmonious combination" of validity, relevance, and consistency. I'm not clear on what kind of relationship or interaction between these three concepts is implied.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what is meant by "harmonious combination" in this context? Is it about independence, overlap, or some other relationship between validity, relevance, and consistency in logical coherence?
