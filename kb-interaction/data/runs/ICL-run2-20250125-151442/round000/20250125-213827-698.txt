==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's take a look at the item from the knowledge base:

{
"id": 50,
"statement": "Epigenetic modifications alter chromatin structure to regulate gene expression dynamically."
}

I'm a bit uncertain about this item. Specifically, I'm wondering what "dynamically" means in this context. Can you elaborate on what it means for gene expression to be regulated dynamically?

Also, can you provide some examples of how epigenetic modifications can alter chromatin structure to regulate gene expression?
