==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's discuss item 30: "Emotional Intelligence includes self-awareness, self-regulation, empathy, motivation, social skills, and resilience."

I'm not very confident about this aspect of emotional intelligence. I'm uncertain about the exact role of motivation in emotional intelligence. Can you help me understand why motivation is included as one of the components of emotional intelligence?

What's your take on this?
