==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item that caught my attention, which is:

{
  "id": 48,
  "statement": "Empathy development involves interplay of biological, environmental, cognitive, emotional, and cultural factors."
}

I have to admit that I'm a bit uncertain about the role of cultural factors in empathy development. Can you elaborate on that part of the statement?

What do you mean by "cultural factors" in this context? Are you referring to individual cultural backgrounds, societal norms, or something else?
