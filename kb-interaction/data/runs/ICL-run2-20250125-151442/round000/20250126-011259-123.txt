==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item: `{ "id": 93, "statement": "Biases influence subjective truth perception through personal and societal factors." }`

I'm interested in understanding this concept better. Specifically, I'm least confident about the nuances of how biases influence subjective truth perception. Can you elaborate on what you think are the key personal and societal factors that contribute to this influence?

In other words, how do individuals' personal biases, such as those formed through upbringing, experiences, or beliefs, affect their perception of truth? And how do societal factors, like cultural norms, political ideologies, or social media, shape our understanding of what is true or false?

Please share your thoughts on this, and I'll be happy to respond and ask follow-up questions.
