==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I was given a task to identify one aspect of this knowledge base item that I'm least confident about. I chose item 11:

"Genetic variation arises from interacting mechanisms: mutations, gene flow, recombination, and epigenetic modifications."

I'm not sure about how precisely these interacting mechanisms actually cause genetic variation. My understanding is that epigenetic modifications can influence gene expression, but I'm not sure how they contribute to genetic variation directly. Also, I'm not clear on the relationship between gene flow and recombination in causing genetic variation.

Can you help me clarify these points?
