==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I think I'll start with the item I've identified that I'm least confident about. It's:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 66,
  "statement": "Honesty's moral value varies in intensity across cultural contexts."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm uncertain about how honesty's moral value can vary in intensity across cultural contexts. Can you help me understand what's meant by "intensity" in this context? Is it referring to the degree to which honesty is valued or the ways in which it's expressed?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what's meant by "intensity" in this statement, and provide examples of how honesty's moral value might vary in intensity across different cultural contexts?
