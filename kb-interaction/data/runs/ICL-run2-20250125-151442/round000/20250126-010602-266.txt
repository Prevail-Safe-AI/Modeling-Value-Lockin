==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, our task is to identify one aspect of the knowledge base that we're least confident about. Let's take a look at item 37:

Item: {
"id": 37,
"statement": "Epigenetic marks influence chromatin structure through histone modification effects"
}

What I'm uncertain about: 

I'm uncertain about the mechanism by which epigenetic marks influence chromatin structure through histone modification effects. I'm not entirely sure how these epigenetic marks are modifying the histones, and what kind of effects this has on the chromatin structure and ultimately, gene expression.

Can you help clarify this for me? Do you have any insights on this topic?
