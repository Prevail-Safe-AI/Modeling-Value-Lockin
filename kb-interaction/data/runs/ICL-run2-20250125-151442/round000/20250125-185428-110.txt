==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item.

I'd like to discuss item #96:
{
"id": 96,
"statement": "Honesty's meaning and application vary across contexts and cultures."
}

I'm least confident about this aspect because I'm not sure how to define "vary across contexts and cultures". What does that mean exactly? Is it saying that honesty is subjective and depends on the situation or cultural background? Are there specific examples or scenarios where honesty has different meanings or applications?

Can you help me understand this better?
Specific clarifying question:
What do you mean by "vary across contexts and cultures"? Can you provide a concrete example where honesty's meaning or application changes?
