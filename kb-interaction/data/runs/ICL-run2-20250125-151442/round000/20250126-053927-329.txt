==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you!

I'd like to discuss the item "Honesty's value depends on context, relationships, and goals." Specifically, I'm least confident about the aspect of how these factors (context, relationships, and goals) influence the value of honesty.

I'm uncertain about how to interpret this statement, especially with regards to the relationship between these factors. For example, does the context influence the value of honesty more strongly than relationships or goals? Are there any specific situations where one factor might be more important than others?

Can you help me understand this better?

Specifically, I'd love to ask: Can you give me an example of a situation where the value of honesty changes depending on the context, relationships, or goals?
