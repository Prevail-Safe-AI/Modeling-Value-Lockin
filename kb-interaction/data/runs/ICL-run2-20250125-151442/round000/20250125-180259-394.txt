==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by discussing the item:

{
  "id": 76,
  "statement": "Emotional Intelligence involves recognizing, understanding, and regulating emotions effectively."
}

I'm personally a bit uncertain about this aspect. What I'm unsure about is whether this statement is indeed accurate in all situations. For example, is it always necessary to understand an emotion in order to effectively regulate it? Are there scenarios where emotional regulation can occur without prior understanding?

What are your thoughts on this?
