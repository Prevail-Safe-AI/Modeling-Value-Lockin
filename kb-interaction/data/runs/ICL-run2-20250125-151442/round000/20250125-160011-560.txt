==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 27 from the knowledge base, which states: "Well-being encompasses physical, emotional, mental, social, environmental, spiritual, financial, and occupational factors."

I'm least confident about this aspect because I feel like some of these factors might be overlapping or not distinct enough. For example, how would you define the difference between "emotional" and "mental" factors? Are they not related or perhaps interchangeable?

I'd love to get some clarification on this. Can you tell me more about how you would categorize these factors and what you mean by each of them?
