==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start!

I've been asked to identify one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the knowledge base, I'm going to choose the item:

```
{
  "id": 60,
  "statement": "Empiricism prioritizes evidence over authority through rigorous data analysis."
}
```

I'm a bit uncertain about this item because of the term "rigorous data analysis". I'm not entirely sure what that means in the context of empiricism and how it relates to prioritizing evidence over authority. Can you help me clarify what this statement is trying to say?

Specifically, I have a few questions:

* What does "rigorous data analysis" entail in empiricism? Are there specific methods or techniques involved?
* How does this rigorous data analysis lead to prioritizing evidence over authority?
* Is there a particular way empiricism distinguishes between evidence-based claims and authority-based claims?

Can you help me better understand this item?
