==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you!

So, I've identified one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 16,
  "statement": "Proof by contradiction assumes opposite, derives logical contradiction, proves truth."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not entirely sure how "proof by contradiction" actually works and what constitutes a "logical contradiction". Could you explain it in simpler terms or provide an example?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you walk me through a step-by-step process of how to apply "proof by contradiction" to prove a mathematical statement or theorem? For instance, can you give an example of a well-known mathematical statement that has been proven using this method?
