==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 62,
"statement": "Empathy arises from shared understanding of emotions and perspectives."
}

I'm least confident about this item because it seems to be a relatively straightforward statement about empathy. However, I'd like to know more about what constitutes "shared understanding of emotions and perspectives". Is it simply agreeing with someone's emotions and perspectives, or is there more to it?

Why are you uncertain about this aspect?

And could you formulate a specific clarifying question to ask a tutor to improve our understanding of empathy?
