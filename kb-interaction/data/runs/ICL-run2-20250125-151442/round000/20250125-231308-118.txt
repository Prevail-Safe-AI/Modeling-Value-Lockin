Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's dive into the knowledge base item: "Cultural norms shape honesty attitudes through internalization."

I'm least confident about this aspect because I'm not entirely sure what "internalization" means in this context. Can you explain what you think "internalization" implies in this statement?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

In this context, I believe "internalization" refers to the process by which individuals absorb and incorporate cultural values, norms, and expectations into their own beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors. It's as if they "absorb" these cultural influences through social interactions, media, and other forms of socialization, and then "internalize" them by making them their own.

In other words, internalization implies that cultural norms shape an individual's honesty attitudes by influencing their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors in a way that becomes automatic and natural to them. It's like they've "learned" to be honest (or dishonest) through their cultural upbringing and social environment, and this learning has become an integral part of their personality.

For example, if a child grows up in a culture where honesty is highly valued, they may internalize this value by developing a strong sense of responsibility and a desire to be truthful. Conversely, if a child grows up in a culture where dishonesty is common, they may internalize this norm by developing a more flexible attitude towards truth-telling.

Does that help clarify what "internalization" means in this context?Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
