==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the item. I've identified one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about, which is:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 16,
"statement": "Logical coherence doesn't necessarily imply relevance for validity."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
Why this statement seems to contradict other claims in the knowledge base that highlight the importance of relevance for argument validity.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand when logical coherence would not imply relevance for validity? For example, are there specific contexts or types of arguments where logical coherence is sufficient, and relevance becomes irrelevant or secondary?

Can you shed some light on this and help me improve my understanding?
