==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying one aspect of this item that I'm least confident about.

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 30,
"statement": "Formal logic ensures logical consistency through sound inference rules."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm uncertain about how formal logic specifically ensures logical consistency. The phrase "through sound inference rules" is a bit vague to me. What concrete examples or mechanisms can illustrate this concept?

Your turn!
