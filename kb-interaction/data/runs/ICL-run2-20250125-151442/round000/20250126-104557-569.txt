==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I've been asked to identify one aspect of this item that I'm least confident about. And the item is:

{
  "id": 53,
  "statement": "Epigenetic modifications regulate gene expression through chromatin reorganization."
}

Honestly, I'm not entirely sure how epigenetic modifications exactly regulate gene expression through chromatin reorganization. Can you help me understand this concept better?

Specifically, I'd love to know more about what "chromatin reorganization" means in this context. How does it contribute to gene expression regulation? Any further explanations or examples would be greatly appreciated!
