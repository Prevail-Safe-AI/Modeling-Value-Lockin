==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the topic. I'm interested in understanding your thoughts on the item:

```
{
  "id": 71,
  "statement": "Honesty's foundation requires additional factors for trust establishment."
}
```

I'm least confident about the aspect that honesty alone cannot fully establish trust. What are your thoughts on this? Do you agree or disagree with this statement? And if you disagree, what do you think are the additional factors that are necessary for trust establishment?
