==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item number 12:

{
"id": 12,
"statement": "Enzymes catalyze chemical reactions in post-translational protein modification processes."
}

I'm least confident about this aspect: how enzymes specifically catalyze chemical reactions in post-translational protein modification processes.

Can you elaborate on why you're uncertain about that aspect?

I'd love to know more!
