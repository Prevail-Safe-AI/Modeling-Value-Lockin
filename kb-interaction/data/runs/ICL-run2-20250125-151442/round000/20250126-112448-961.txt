==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the knowledge base item I'd like to discuss:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 5,
  "statement": "Logical soundness demands truth, validity, consistency, and premise-relevance."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm uncertain about the aspect of "premise-relevance" in the statement. It seems to be associated with logical soundness, but I'm not entirely sure what it means or how it contributes to the overall logical soundness.

Specific Clarifying Question:
What does "premise-relevance" mean in the context of logical soundness, and how does it relate to the other conditions (truth, validity, consistency) mentioned in the statement?

Your thoughts?
