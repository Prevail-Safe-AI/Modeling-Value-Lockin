==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'd like to discuss the statement:

{
"id": 6,
"statement": "Multiple forces compact DNA: electrostatic, hydrophobic, hydrogen, π-π stacking"
}

I'm least confident about this item. I'm uncertain about the concept of π-π stacking in the context of DNA compaction.

Can you elaborate on why π-π stacking is important in wrapping DNA around histones, if that's correct?
