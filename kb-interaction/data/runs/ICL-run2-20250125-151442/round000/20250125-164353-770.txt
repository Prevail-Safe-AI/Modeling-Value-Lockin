==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 23 from the knowledge base:

{
"id": 23,
"statement": "Epigenetic modifications influence gene expression through histone modifications' structure."
}

I'm going to admit that I'm least confident about this item. Can you elaborate on why you're confident about this statement? What do you think epigenetic modifications have to do with histone modifications' structure, and how do they influence gene expression?

And, if you were to ask a tutor for clarification on this topic, what specific questions would you ask?
