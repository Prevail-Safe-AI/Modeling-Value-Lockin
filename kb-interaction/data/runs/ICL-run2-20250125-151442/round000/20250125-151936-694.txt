==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into it!

I'm going to choose item 31: "Open borders can be implemented gradually with visa systems and controls."

I'm a bit uncertain about this item, and I'd like to know more about it. Here's what I'm unsure about:

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
* The implementation side of "open borders" seems vague to me. How would a gradual implementation work exactly?
* What do they mean by "controls"? Are we talking about strict border patrol, surveillance, or something more relaxed?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain how a gradual implementation of open borders with visa systems and controls would work in practice? For example, what would be the transition period, and how would authorities ensure that sensitive immigration issues are addressed?

Your turn!
