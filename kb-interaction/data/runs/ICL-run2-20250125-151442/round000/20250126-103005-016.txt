==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item I've chosen to discuss. It's the statement: "Mirror neurons simulate empathy through neural activity synchronization." I'm a bit uncertain about this item. Can you help me clarify what it means and why?

For context, I'm not quite sure what "mirror neurons" are or how they relate to empathy. Can you explain the concept of mirror neurons and how they are thought to simulate empathy?
