==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item from the knowledge base:

```
{
  "id": 37,
  "statement": "Epigenetic modifications occur through histone modifications, chromatin remodeling complexes, and their interactions."
}
```

I'm feeling least confident about this item. Can you help me understand it better?

What specifically are histone modifications, chromatin remodeling complexes, and their interactions, and how do they lead to epigenetic modifications?

Also, are there any clarifying questions you would ask a tutor to improve your understanding of this concept?

Let's go!
