==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's take a look at item 51: "{ 'id': 51, 'statement': 'Epigenetic marks regulate chromatin structure dynamically in response.' }".

I'm least confident about this item. I'd like to understand more about how epigenetic marks can dynamically regulate chromatin structure in response to something. Can you elaborate on what you think "in response" means in this context? For example, is it in response to environmental factors, cellular signals, or something else?
