==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by discussing Item 74: "Emotional validation is a specific skill within emotional intelligence." I'm not very confident about this aspect. I'm uncertain about what emotional validation really means and how it fits into the concept of emotional intelligence.

I'm wondering if emotional validation is just a more detailed or precise term for something like empathy, or if it has a more specific connotation or function within emotional intelligence. Maybe it's about acknowledging and accepting someone's emotions without necessarily having the same emotional response? Or perhaps it's more about providing a sense of safety or understanding for the other person?

Can you help me clarify what you think emotional validation really means and how it relates to emotional intelligence?
