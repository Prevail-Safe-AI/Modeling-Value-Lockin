==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I think we're supposed to discuss one specific item from the knowledge base, which is statement 77: "Logical soundness relies on accurate, relevant, true, and consistent premises."

So, my task is to identify one aspect of this item that I'm least confident about, elaborate why I'm uncertain about it, and formulate specific clarifying questions to ask a tutor to improve my understanding.

Honestly, I'm a bit uncertain about the phrase "consistent premises". What does "consistent" mean in this context? Does it refer to the logical connection between premises, or is it related to the repetition of similar premises throughout the argument?

What are your thoughts on this item?
