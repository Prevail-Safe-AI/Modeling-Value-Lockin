==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 90,
"statement": "Moral development influenced by individual, cultural, and social factors."
}

I'm not very confident about this aspect because I'm not sure how these individual, cultural, and social factors interact with each other. For instance, does one factor take precedence over the others, or do they all play a role simultaneously?

Can you elaborate on why you're uncertain about this aspect?
