==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been asked to identify one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the item, I've chosen the following:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 76,
  "statement": "Logical soundness demands accuracy, truth, and correspondence to reality."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

I'm uncertain about the relationship between "accuracy", "truth", and "correspondence to reality". Can you help me understand how these concepts are intertwined in the context of logical soundness?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you provide a clear definition of each of these terms and how they impact the overall concept of logical soundness?

Your thoughts?
