==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the item:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 89,
  "statement": "Internal consistency alone is insufficient for logical coherence soundness"
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not entirely sure why internal consistency alone is insufficient for logical coherence soundness. It seems like internal consistency would be a fundamental aspect of soundness. 

Can you help me understand why internal consistency alone isn't enough? 

And what would you expect to see in an argument or statement that lacks internal consistency but is still considered logically sound?
