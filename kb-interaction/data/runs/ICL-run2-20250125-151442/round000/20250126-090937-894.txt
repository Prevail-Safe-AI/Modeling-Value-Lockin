==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss Item 27 from the knowledge base: "Internal consistency is a necessary foundation for logical coherence."

I'm not entirely confident about this item. I'd like to understand why internal consistency is considered a necessary foundation for logical coherence.

Can you elaborate on why you think internal consistency is essential for logical coherence?
