==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's focus on item 33: "Weak non-covalent bonds facilitate enzyme-substrate recognition through specificity". I'm curious about this aspect, and I'm least confident about it.

I'm unsure about how weak non-covalent bonds facilitate enzyme-substrate recognition, especially the role of specificity in this process. Can you elaborate on what you think is happening here? How do these weak bonds recognize the substrate with such specificity?

What's your take on this?
