==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 44 from the knowledge base:

{
"id": 44,
"statement": "Histone modifications alter chromatin structure through various mechanisms."
}

I'm least confident about this item. I'd like to know more about it because I'm not entirely clear how histone modifications affect chromatin structure.

Can you elaborate on why histone modifications alter chromatin structure through various mechanisms? What exactly do you mean by "various mechanisms"?
