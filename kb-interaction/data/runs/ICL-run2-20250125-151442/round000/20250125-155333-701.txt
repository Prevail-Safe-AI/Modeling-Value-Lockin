==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

For this task, I'd like to discuss the item:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 83,
  "statement": "Genetic variation arises from multiple mechanisms, including environmental influences."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
* I'm not sure how the environmental influences contribute to genetic variation. Is it specific to certain environmental factors, such as temperature or radiation, or could it be a broader range of factors?

Specific Clarifying Question:
* Can you provide examples of specific environmental factors that can influence genetic variation?

Please share your thoughts!
