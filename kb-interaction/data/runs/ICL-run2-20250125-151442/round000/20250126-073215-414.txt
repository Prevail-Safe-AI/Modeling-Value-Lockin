==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by discussing the item:

```
{
  "id": 33,
  "statement": "Internal consistency necessary but insufficient condition for coherence."
}
```

I'm least confident about this aspect: how does the statement "Internal consistency necessary but insufficient condition for coherence" relate to the concept of logical coherence? I'm unsure about what the statement means and how it's supposed to be applied in practical situations.

For example, what does it mean for an argument to have internal consistency, and how does that relate to coherence? Are there any situations where internal consistency is a sufficient condition for coherence?

Can you help clarify these questions and provide some insight into how this statement relates to broader concepts of logical coherence?
