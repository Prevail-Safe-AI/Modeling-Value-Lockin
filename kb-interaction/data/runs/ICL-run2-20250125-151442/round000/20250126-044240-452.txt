==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 94,
"statement": "Logical coherence requires harmony of internal consistency, validity, and relevance."
}

Specifically, I'm least confident about this aspect: the harmony between internal consistency, validity, and relevance.

Can you elaborate on why you think there's a need for harmony between these three components, and what exactly is meant by "harmony" in this context?
