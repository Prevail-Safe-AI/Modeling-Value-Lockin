==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. It's item 98:

{
"id": 98,
"statement": "Epigenetic regulation involves reversible histone modification and remodeling."
}

I'm unsure about this item because I'm not familiar with the term "reversible" in the context of epigenetic regulation. I'm not sure what it means or how it relates to histone modification and remodeling. Can you help me understand this concept better?

What do you think about this item? Do you have any insights or clarification on this topic?
