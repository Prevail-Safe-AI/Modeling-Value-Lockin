==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item from the knowledge base: 

```
{
  "id": 1,
  "statement": "Histones compact DNA through electrostatic, hydrogen, and hydrophobic interactions."
}
```

I'm least confident about the specific interactions mentioned in this item. I'm not sure how these electrostatic, hydrogen, and hydrophobic interactions actually work together to compact DNA.

Can you help me understand this better?
