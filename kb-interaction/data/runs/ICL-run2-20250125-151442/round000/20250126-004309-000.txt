==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 21,
"statement": "Internalization involves adopting social values and norms automatically."
}

I'm least confident about this item. I'm unsure about the notion that internalization occurs automatically, without conscious awareness. It seems like an important aspect of social learning and human development, but I'm not entirely convinced that it happens entirely without our conscious attention.

Can you help me understand why the statement suggests that internalization is automatic? Are there any specific research findings or theoretical frameworks that support this idea?
