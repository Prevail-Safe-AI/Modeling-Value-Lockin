==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's focus on the item: `{"id": 70, "statement": "Subjective evaluation can lead to biased evidence verification conclusions."}`

I'm least confident about this item because I'd like to know more about what constitutes a "subjective evaluation" in this context. Is it referring to personal opinions, emotions, or values influencing the evaluation of evidence? And what exactly does "biased evidence verification conclusions" mean in this context? Are we talking about flawed or distorted conclusions, or conclusions that are simply influenced by the evaluator's perspective?

Can you help me clarify these points?
