==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item #15 from the knowledge base:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 15,
"statement": "Internal consistency demands logical coherence and absence of contradictions."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

To be honest, I'm not completely confident about the relationship between internal consistency and logical coherence. I'm wondering if the two concepts are interchangeable or if one is a subset of the other.

Specific Clarifying Question:

Can you elaborate on how internal consistency relates to logical coherence, and specifically what you mean by "absence of contradictions"? Are contradictions a necessary condition for internal inconsistency, or are there other ways an argument can be internally inconsistent?

Your thoughts?
