==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'd like to discuss item 78:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 78,
"statement": "Emotional Intelligence involves interconnected components influencing each other."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not entirely confident about the phrase "interconnected components influencing each other." Could you help me understand what the author means by this?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what specific components of emotional intelligence are meant to be interconnected, and in what way do they influence each other? Is it referring to the four components of emotional intelligence mentioned earlier (self-awareness, regulation, empathy, and resilience)?
