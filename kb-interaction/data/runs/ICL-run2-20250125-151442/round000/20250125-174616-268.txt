==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you!

Okay, let's dive into it. I'd like to start with the item:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 1,
  "statement": "Epigenetic modifications, through histone modification, alter chromatin structure."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

Honestly, I'm not confident about the relationship between histone modification and chromatin structure. Can you elaborate why you think epigenetic modifications, through histone modification, alter chromatin structure?

Specific Clarifying Question:

To better understand this concept, I'd like to ask: What is the specific mechanism by which histone modification leads to changes in chromatin structure? Is it a direct causal relationship or does it involve other factors?

Please share your thoughts!
