==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying one aspect of the item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. According to the knowledge base, item 7 states "Bioinformatics combines biology, computer science, mathematics, and statistics". I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect.

Things I'm Uncertain About This Item:
* What specifically does "combines" mean in this context? Is it a straightforward addition of these disciplines, or does it imply something more complex like integration or fusion?

Specific Clarifying Question:
* Can you please clarify what the phrase "combines" implies in the context of bioinformatics, and provide an example of how these disciplines are integrated in bioinformatics research or applications?
