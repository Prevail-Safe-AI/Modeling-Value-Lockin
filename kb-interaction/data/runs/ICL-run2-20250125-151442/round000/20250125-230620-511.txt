==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 20: "Honesty alone is necessary but insufficient for trust establishment." I'm the least confident about this aspect. I'm uncertain about what "necessary but insufficient" really means in this context.

Can you help me understand what the authors of the knowledge base mean by "necessary"? Are they saying that honesty is crucial for trust establishment, but it's not enough on its own?

And what about "insufficient"? Does it mean that there are additional factors that need to be present for trust establishment to occur?

Can you help me clarify these points?
