==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with item 45:

{
"id": 45,
"statement": "Epigenetic modifications alter chromatin structure regulating gene expression."
}

I'm least confident about this statement. To be honest, I'm not entirely sure what chromatin structure is or how epigenetic modifications affect it. Can you help me understand this concept better?

What is chromatin, and how does it relate to gene expression?
