==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, I've been looking at the knowledge base and I came across item 80:

{
"id": 80,
"statement": "Logical soundness depends on truth, validity, consistency, and premise-relevance."
}

I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect. I'm not entirely sure what "premise-relevance" means in this context. Can you elaborate on what you think it means and how it relates to logical soundness?

(P.S. You can respond as if you're the tutor, and I'll respond accordingly.)
