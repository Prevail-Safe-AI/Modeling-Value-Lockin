==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the item from the knowledge base:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 46,
"statement": "Honesty is a fundamental moral value, prerequisite for trust."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm uncertain about the phrase "prerequisite for trust". I'm not entirely convinced that honesty is always a necessary condition for trust.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what you mean by "prerequisite for trust"? Are there cases where trust can exist without honesty?
