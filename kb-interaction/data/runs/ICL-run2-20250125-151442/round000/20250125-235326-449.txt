==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the knowledge base item I've selected. I'm least confident about:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 31,
"statement": "Epigenetic modifications alter chromatin structure, influencing gene expression"
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm unsure about how epigenetic modifications specifically alter chromatin structure, and what implications this has on gene expression.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain the specific mechanisms by which epigenetic modifications alter chromatin structure, and how does this impact gene expression? Are there any specific examples or cases where this has been observed?

Your turn!
