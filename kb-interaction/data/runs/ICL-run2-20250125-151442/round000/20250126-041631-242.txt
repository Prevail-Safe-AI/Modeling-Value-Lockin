==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's focus on the item:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 91,
  "statement": "Logical coherence emphasizes consistency and validity primarily."
}
```

I'm curious about this item because I'm least confident about it. I'm wondering why this item specifically says that logical coherence "emphasizes" consistency and validity primarily, and not other factors.

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

* Why are consistency and validity emphasized primarily? Are there other factors that are not as important?

Can you help me better understand this item?
