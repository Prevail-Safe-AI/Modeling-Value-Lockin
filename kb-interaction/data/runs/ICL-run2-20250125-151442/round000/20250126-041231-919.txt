==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item I'm least confident about, which is:

```
{
  "id": 66,
  "statement": "Histone modifications regulate chromatin structure and gene expression dynamics."
}
```

I'm uncertain about the relationships between histone modifications, chromatin structure, and gene expression dynamics. I'm not clear on how exactly histone modifications alter chromatin structure and impact gene expression.

Can you elaborate on why histone modifications are important for setting gene expression levels and how they interact with chromatin structure to achieve this?
