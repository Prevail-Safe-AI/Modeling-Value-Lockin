```
{
  "id": 99,
  "statement": "Emotions facilitate social cohesion through empathy and understanding."
}
```

I'm interested in knowing what aspects of this item you're least confident about. Can you identify one particular aspect that you're unsure about or would like more clarification on?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

After reviewing the item, I'd say that I'm least confident about the phrase "social cohesion". While I understand the concept of social cohesion as a sense of unity and togetherness within a group or community, I'm not entirely sure how emotions, empathy, and understanding specifically facilitate this cohesion.

I'd love to know more about what the author meant by this statement, and how they envision emotions playing a role in bringing people together. Is it through shared emotional experiences, emotional intelligence, or something else entirely?
