==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item: "Context and intent guide evaluation of oppressive laws."

I'm least confident about this item. I'm not sure what exactly "oppressive laws" refers to, and how context and intent can guide their evaluation.

Can you elaborate on what kind of laws you're talking about being "oppressive"? For example, are you talking about laws that are discriminatory in nature, or laws that are overly broad or vague?

Additionally, how do you differentiate between oppressive laws and laws that are simply unpopular or controversial? What specific factors should be taken into account when evaluating the context and intent behind a law?

Please help me fill in these gaps in my understanding!
