==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
  "id": 16,
  "statement": "Lying can be morally justifiable in self-defense or protection circumstances."
}

I'm least confident about this aspect: Are there any specific situations or criteria that make lying morally justifiable in self-defense or protection circumstances? I'm unsure about what types of lies would be considered morally justifiable and what the consequences would be.

Can you help me clarify this further?
