==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been asked to identify one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about, and then elaborate on why I'm uncertain about it.

After reviewing the item, I'd like to acknowledge that I'm least confident about the statement: |
{
  "id": 77,
  "statement": "Chromatin remodeling enzymes alter chromatin structure and epigenetic marks."
}

I'm uncertain about this item because I'm not entirely clear about the role of chromatin remodeling enzymes in epigenetic modifications. While I understand that chromatin remodeling enzymes help to reorganize chromatin structure, I'm not sure how exactly they impact epigenetic marks.

Can you help clarify the relationship between chromatin remodeling enzymes and epigenetic modifications?
