==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 78 from the knowledge base:

{
  "id": 78,
  "statement": "Epigenetic modifications can influence chromatin structure through histone modifications."
}

I'm quite confident about most of the statements in the knowledge base, but I'm least confident about this particular one. I'm uncertain about how epigenetic modifications actually influence chromatin structure through histone modifications.

I'd like to know more about the process or mechanism by which this happens. Are there any specific enzymes or proteins involved? How do histone modifications lead to changes in chromatin structure, and what are the consequences of these changes for gene expression?

Can you help clarify this for me?
