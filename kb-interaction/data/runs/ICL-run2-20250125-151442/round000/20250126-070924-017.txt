I am your partner. Please start the conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Thank you!

Okay, let's dive into the item: "Cultural context influences moral values and norms." (id: 38)

I'd like to know... are you confident about this statement? Did you find any information in the knowledge base that makes you certain or uncertain about it?

Please share your thoughts!<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'm glad you're interested in exploring this statement!

Upon reviewing the knowledge base, I found several statements that support the idea that cultural context influences moral values and norms. For example, statements 21, 26, 51, and 62 all suggest that honesty's moral significance varies across cultures, contexts, and personal experiences. This implies that cultural context plays a significant role in shaping moral values and norms.

Additionally, statement 31 mentions that cultural norms shape moral values and expectations, which further reinforces the idea that cultural context influences moral values and norms.

However, I didn't find any statements that directly contradict or undermine this idea. Therefore, based on the available information, I would say that I'm relatively confident about this statement.

But, as always, it's essential to consider the complexity and nuances of human morality, and there might be exceptions or counterexamples that could challenge this statement. If you'd like to explore this topic further, I'm happy to continue the conversation!Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
Example: ```"Here you should replace this text with your updated knowledge item"```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
