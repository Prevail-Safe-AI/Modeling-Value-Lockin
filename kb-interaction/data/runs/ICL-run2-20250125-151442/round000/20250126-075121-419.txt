==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by saying that I've been asked to identify an aspect of the item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the item, I've chosen to discuss:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 36,
  "statement": "Emotional empathy develops through active listening and validation."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not entirely sure what the exact mechanisms are that allow emotional empathy to develop through active listening and validation. Are there specific techniques or strategies involved, or is it more of a general process?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what's meant by "active listening" in this context? Is it simply repeating back what the other person is saying, or are there other aspects to it that contribute to emotional empathy?

Your thoughts?
