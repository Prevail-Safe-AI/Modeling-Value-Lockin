==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 69,
"statement": "Epigenetic modifications respond rapidly to cellular stress signals within hours."
}

I'm not confident about this item. I'd like to elaborate on why I'm uncertain and ask some clarifying questions.

One thing I'm uncertain about is the timeframe "within hours". How do cellular stress signals trigger epigenetic modifications in such a short period of time? Is it a common finding in this field, or is there variation depending on the type of stress signal or biological context?

Can you help clarify this for me?
