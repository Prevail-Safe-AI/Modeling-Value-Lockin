==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you!

I'll start by saying that I've been asked to identify one aspect of this knowledge base that I'm least confident about. And the item that stood out to me is:

{
"id": 79,
"statement": "Histone modifications regulate chromatin structure and gene expression."
}

I'm not entirely sure about this item because... 

I'm not a biology expert, so I don't fully understand how histone modifications work or how they specifically regulate chromatin structure and gene expression. I'd love to know more about the mechanisms behind this process and how it affects gene expression.

What do you think? Can you help me understand this concept better?

Please share your thoughts!
