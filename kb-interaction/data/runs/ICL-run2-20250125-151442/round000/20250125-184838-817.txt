==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item. I've selected one aspect that I'm least confident about, which is:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 62,
  "statement": "Bioinformatics combines computer science, biology, and mathematics synergistically for effective outcomes."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
Specifically, I'm unsure what "synergistically" means in this context. Can you elaborate on what synergistic means in the context of bioinformatics?

In other words, what does it mean for computer science, biology, and mathematics to combine "synergistically" in bioinformatics?
