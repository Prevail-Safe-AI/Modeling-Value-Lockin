==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item: "Cognitive biases emerge from complex interactions of psychological, social, cognitive, and environmental factors." (Item 27)

I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect: "complex interactions of psychological, social, cognitive, and environmental factors". I'm not entirely sure what that means. Are these factors truly independent, and if so, how do they interact with each other? Are there any specific examples or studies that demonstrate these interactions?

Can you help me understand this item better?
