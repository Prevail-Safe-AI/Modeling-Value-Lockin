==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm going to ask about the knowledge base statement:

{
"id": 98,
"statement": "Empathy involves understanding and acknowledging shared emotional experiences."
}

I'm a bit uncertain about this item. Specifically, I'm not sure what it means by "shared emotional experiences". Can you help me clarify?
