==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's take a look at this item from the knowledge base:

{
"id": 95,
"statement": "Classical logic simplifies complex problems by ignoring nuances."
}

I'm going to identify one aspect of this item that I'm least confident about. That aspect is the term "ignoring nuances". I'm not entirely clear on what it means to "ignore nuances" in the context of classical logic and complex problems.

Can you help me understand what this phrase means? Are there specific examples or scenarios where classical logic might be said to ignore nuances?
