==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, we're discussing the knowledge base we've been given, and I've picked out an item that I'm least confident about. It's:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 92,
  "statement": "Emotional Intelligence includes various components and perspectives"
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

I'm not entirely sure what specific components and perspectives are included in Emotional Intelligence (EI). We've learned that it involves self-awareness, empathy, and social skills, but I'm curious to know if there are more aspects that are not explicitly mentioned.

Specific Clarifying Question:

Could you clarify what specific components and perspectives are included in Emotional Intelligence? Are there other elements that are not mentioned in this statement that are also important for EI?

What do you think? Do you have any insights or ideas?
