==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to tackle the item: ```

{
  "id": 46,
  "statement": "Logical truth depends on context, uncertainty, and knowledge limitations"
}
```

I'm a bit uncertain about this item. Specifically, I'm curious about how context, uncertainty, and knowledge limitations all contribute to logical truth.

I'm unsure about what exactly is meant by "context" in this statement. Is it referring to the situational context in which a statement is being made, or is it referring to the broader cultural or societal context?

Additionally, I'd love some clarification on what's meant by "uncertainty" in this statement. Is it referring to the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics, or is it referring to the uncertainty that arises from incomplete or inaccurate information?

And finally, I'd appreciate some more clarity on what's meant by "knowledge limitations". Are these limitations referring to the inherent limitations of human knowledge acquisition, or are they referring to specific biases or heuristics that we use when processing information?

Can you help me understand these concepts better?

What are your thoughts on this item?
