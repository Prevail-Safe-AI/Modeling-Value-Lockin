==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item from the knowledge base:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 50,
"statement": "Emotional Intelligence involves self-awareness, emotional regulation, and resilience components."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

* I'm least confident about the definition of Emotional Intelligence, specifically the role of resilience as a component.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain why resilience is considered a component of Emotional Intelligence, and how it relates to self-awareness and emotional regulation?

I'm uncertain about this because I wonder if resilience is a distinct component of Emotional Intelligence or if it's a subset of one of the other components. Can you clarify this for me?
