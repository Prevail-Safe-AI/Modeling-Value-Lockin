==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, I've been reviewing the knowledge base, and I came across item 20:

{
"id": 20,
"statement": "Empathy development involves interplay of genetic, environmental, and cognitive factors."
}

I'm feeling a bit uncertain about this statement. I'm not entirely sure how these factors interact with each other to influence empathy development. Can you help me understand this aspect better?

What do you think are some of the key factors at play here? For example, how do genetic factors affect empathy development, and what role do environmental and cognitive factors play?
