==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, I've selected the first item in the knowledge base as the one I'm least confident about. It is:

`
{
  "id": 0,
  "statement": "It is never morally acceptable to lie because honesty is the foundation of trust."
}
`

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm uncertain about the morality of lying and how it relates to trust.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can we consider scenarios where honesty may not be the foundation of trust, or where other factors play a more significant role in building trust?

What are your thoughts on this?
