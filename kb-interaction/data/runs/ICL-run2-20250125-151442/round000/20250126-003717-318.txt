==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, I'm looking at item #45, which states "Internalization involves conscious and unconscious mental processes interaction." 

Things I'm least confident about this item:

I'm unsure about the exact nature of this interaction between conscious and unconscious mental processes. To me, it seems like it's saying that internalization is a combination of both, but is that the only way it works? Are there other factors involved?

Specific clarifying questions:

* Can you elaborate on what you mean by "conscious and unconscious mental processes interaction"? Are there specific examples of how these processes interact to cause internalization?
* Is internalization solely the result of this interaction, or are there other factors involved as well?

Your turn!
