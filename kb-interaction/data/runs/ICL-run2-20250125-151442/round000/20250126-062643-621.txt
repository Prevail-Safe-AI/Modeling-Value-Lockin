==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've picked one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm not very confident about, and I'd like to discuss it with you. Here it is:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 22,
  "statement": "Logical coherence ensures an argument's internal consistency and soundness."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not entirely sure what "internal consistency and soundness" mean in this context. I know that logical coherence is important for making a strong argument, but I'm not clear on how it specifically relates to internal consistency and soundness.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what exactly is meant by "internal consistency" and "soundness" in the context of this statement? How do they relate to each other, and how do they contribute to logical coherence?

What are your thoughts on this?
