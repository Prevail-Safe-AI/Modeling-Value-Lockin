==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item you mentioned from the knowledge base:

{
  "id": 94,
  "statement": "Logical coherence ensures internal consistency, not necessarily truth."
}

I'm not entirely confident about this item. Can you elaborate on what you think this means, and what's behind this idea of "internal consistency" not necessarily being equivalent to "truth"?

For me, I'm struggling to understand the nuances between consistency and truth. Are we talking about logical consistency within an argument, as opposed to the actual validity or accuracy of the argument itself? Or is there something more subtle going on here that I'm missing?
