==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, we're looking at the knowledge base and we need to identify one aspect of it that we're least confident about. I'm going to go ahead and choose item 10, which is:

"Epigenetic modifications regulate gene expression by altering chromatin structure."

I'm not entirely sure about this item. I'm uncertain about what exactly "altering chromatin structure" means in the context of epigenetic modifications and gene expression. Can you help me understand why this item might be true or why we might be uncertain about it?
