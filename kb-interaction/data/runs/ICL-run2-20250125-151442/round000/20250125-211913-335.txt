==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the item I'm supposed to discuss. The item is:

{
"id": 35,
"statement": "Genetic predispositions, epigenetics, and brain structure interact in moral development."
}

I have to identify an aspect of this item that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the knowledge base, I'm least confident about the statement itself. I'm not entirely sure how genetic predispositions, epigenetics, and brain structure interact in moral development. Can you help me understand this better?

What are some possible ways these factors interact? Is there any specific research or evidence that supports this statement?
