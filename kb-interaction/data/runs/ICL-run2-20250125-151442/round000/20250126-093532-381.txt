==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been given a knowledge base containing 99 statements, and I've been asked to identify one aspect that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the statements, I've chosen the following one:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 85,
  "statement": "Empathy involves harmonious integration of cognitive, emotional, and social processes."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not entirely sure what it means by "harmonious integration" in the context of empathy. What does it imply about the relationship between cognitive, emotional, and social processes?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what "harmonious integration" means in this context? For example, are these processes independent but working together, or are they more intertwined and influencing each other in some way?
