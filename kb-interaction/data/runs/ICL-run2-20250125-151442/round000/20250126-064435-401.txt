==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item "Epigenetic marks influenced by environmental factors through gene expression mechanisms." (ID: 74)

To be honest, I'm not entirely confident about this aspect of the knowledge base. I'd love to understand it better.

Here's what I'm uncertain about: I'm not entirely clear on how environmental factors influence epigenetic marks, especially through gene expression mechanisms. Could you help me understand this better? What specifically do you think are the ways in which environmental factors influence epigenetic marks?

Can you elaborate on this?
