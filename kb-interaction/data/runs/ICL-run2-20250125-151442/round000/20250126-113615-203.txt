==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thanks!

So, I've been going through the knowledge base, and I've selected an item that I'm least confident about. It's:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 82,
  "statement": "Covalent bonds form phosphodiester linkages in DNA backbone structure."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

For me, it's the specific relationship between covalent bonds and phosphodiester linkages in DNA backbone structure. I'm not entirely sure what "phosphodiester linkages" mean or how they fit into the overall structure of DNA.

Specific Clarifying Question:

Can you help me understand what "phosphodiester linkages" are and how they relate to covalent bonds in the DNA backbone structure? I'd love to know if they're a type of bond, a specific function, or something else entirely!
