==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been asked to identify one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about.

The item is:

{
"id": 61,
"statement": "Empathy involves harmonious integration of cognitive, emotional, and neural processes."
}

I'm most uncertain about the concept of "harmonious integration" in this statement. Can you help me understand what this means exactly? How do cognitive, emotional, and neural processes need to be integrated harmoniously for empathy to occur? 

What's your take on this?
