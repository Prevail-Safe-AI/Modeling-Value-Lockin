==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, I was going through the knowledge base and I came across item 12: "Moral integrity balances truth with contextual considerations carefully in decision-making." I have to admit that I'm a bit uncertain about this statement.

Things I'm Uncertain About This Item:

* What does "balancing truth with contextual considerations" actually mean? Is it saying that moral integrity prioritizes either truth or context, or is it saying that there's a delicate balance between the two?
* How do we define "contextual considerations" in this context? Is it referring to external factors like societal norms, cultural values, or personal relationships, or is it referring to internal factors like personal values and principles?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what "balancing truth with contextual considerations" means in the context of moral integrity?
