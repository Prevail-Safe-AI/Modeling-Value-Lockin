==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start. So, the item we're discussing is:

{
"id": 54,
"statement": "Genetic, epigenetic, and brain factors jointly shape moral development."
}

I'm a bit uncertain about this item, and I'm wondering if you could help me elaborate on what makes you confident or uncertain about it.

What do you think about this statement? Do you think genetic, epigenetic, and brain factors really play a joint role in shaping moral development?
