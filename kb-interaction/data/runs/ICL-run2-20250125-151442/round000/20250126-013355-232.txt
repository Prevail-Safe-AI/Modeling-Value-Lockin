==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to ask you about the item:

{
"id": 33,
"statement": "Biological factors include evolution and neurobiology, influencing societal values."
}

I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect. I'm wondering, what do you think "biological factors" exactly refer to in this context? Is it only considering the role of genetics and evolutionary pressures on shaping societal values, or are there other biological factors at play as well, such as hormones, brain structure, or something else?
