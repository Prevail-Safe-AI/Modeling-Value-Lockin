==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item:

Item to Discuss:

{
"id": 52,
"statement": "Logical coherence ensures soundness through internal consistency and relevance."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm unsure about the relationship between internal consistency and relevance in ensuring soundness. It feels like it's saying that internal consistency is the primary factor, but does the relevance really play a crucial role in logical coherence?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you help me understand how the relevance aspect contributes to the soundness of logical coherence, and what specific scenarios or examples might illustrate this relationship better?
