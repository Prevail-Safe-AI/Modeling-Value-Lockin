==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's discuss the item:

{
"id": 75,
"statement": "Honesty not always foundation of trust in all cultures."
}

I'm a bit uncertain about this item. Can you help me clarify things?

Firstly, I'm wondering about what kind of cultures would not consider honesty as a foundation of trust. Are you thinking of specific cultural values or societal norms that might not prioritize honesty in the same way that we do in Western societies?
