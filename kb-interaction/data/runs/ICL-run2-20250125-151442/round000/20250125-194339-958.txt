==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the topic!

I've been asked to identify one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the item,

{
  "id": 77,
  "statement": "Honesty is a necessary condition for trust establishment"
}

I'm least confident about the idea that honesty is a necessary condition for trust establishment. I'm not sure what the exact boundaries of "necessary" are in this context. Does it mean that without honesty, trust cannot be established at all, or can honest behavior be a stepping stone towards establishing trust?

What are your thoughts on this?
