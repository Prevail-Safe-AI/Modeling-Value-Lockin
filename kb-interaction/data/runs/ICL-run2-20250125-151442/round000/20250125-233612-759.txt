==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss Item 89: "Cultural identity emerges from internalization and social conformism."

I'm least confident about this item because I'm not entirely sure what "internalization" and "social conformism" mean in this context. Could you elaborate on what you think these concepts refer to when applied to cultural identity?

Also, how do you think these two concepts interact with each other in shaping cultural identity? Do they work separately or in conjunction?
