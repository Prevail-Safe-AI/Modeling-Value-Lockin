==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'd like to discuss this item:

```
{
  "id": 19,
  "statement": "Internal consistency is a necessary, but insufficient condition for validity."
}
```

I'm least confident about the aspect that internal consistency is insufficient for validity. I'd like to understand why it's insufficient and what else is required for validity.

Can you help me understand why internal consistency alone is not enough for validity?
