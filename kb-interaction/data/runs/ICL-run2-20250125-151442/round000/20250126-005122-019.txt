==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll choose an item from the knowledge base that I'm not very confident about. Let's say it's item 95:

Item to Discuss:
{
  "id": 95,
  "statement": "Histone-modifying enzymes regulate chromatin structure through chemical modifications."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
The relationship between "chemical modifications" and "chromatin structure". How exactly do histone-modifying enzymes modify chromatin structure through chemical modifications? Is it an addition, removal, or alteration of specific chemical groups on the histone proteins?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you explain the specific mechanisms by which histone-modifying enzymes, such as histone acetyltransferases or histone methyltransferases, modify chromatin structure through chemical modifications, and how this affects gene expression?
