==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to learn more about this knowledge base. I've been given a task to identify one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about.

After reviewing the information, I've found an item that caught my attention:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 93,
  "statement": "Theory of Mind involves complex mental state simulation processes."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

ummy, I'm not entirely sure what this concept of "Theory of Mind" means, especially the phrase "complex mental state simulation processes". Can you help me understand what that means in simple terms?

Can you explain or provide an example to help me better grasp the concept?

Specific Clarifying Question:
What does "complex mental state simulation processes" entail in the context of Theory of Mind?
