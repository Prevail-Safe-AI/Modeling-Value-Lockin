Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not entirely sure how "proof by contradiction" actually works and what constitutes a "logical contradiction". Could you explain it in simpler terms or provide an example?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you walk me through a step-by-step process of how to apply "proof by contradiction" to prove a mathematical statement or theorem? For instance, can you give an example of a well-known mathematical statement that has been proven using this method?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'd be happy to help clarify "proof by contradiction" for you.

**What is Proof by Contradiction?**

Proof by contradiction, also known as reductio ad absurdum, is a mathematical proof technique used to show that a statement is true. The idea is to assume that the statement is false and then derive a logical contradiction from that assumption. This contradiction shows that the original assumption was incorrect, and therefore, the statement must be true.

**How Does it Work?**

Here's a step-by-step process to apply proof by contradiction:

1. **Assume the opposite**: Start by assuming that the statement you want to prove is false. This is often denoted as "not P" or "~P".
2. **Derive a logical contradiction**: Use the assumed opposite to derive a logical contradiction. This means you'll show that the assumption leads to a statement that is clearly false or impossible.
3. **Conclude that the original statement is true**: Since the assumption led to a logical contradiction, you can conclude that the original statement must be true. This is because the assumption was shown to be incorrect, and the only way to resolve the contradiction is to accept the original statement.

**Example:**

Let's use the statement "There is no largest natural number" as an example. We'll prove it using proof by contradiction.

Assume that there is a largest natural number, which we'll call "n".

Derive a logical contradiction: If n is the largest natural number, then there must be a natural number greater than n (let's call it n+1). This contradicts the assumption that n is the largest natural number.

Conclude that the original statement is true: Since the assumption led to a logical contradiction, we can conclude that there is no largest natural number.

**Well-Known Mathematical Statement Proven using Proof by Contradiction:**

One famous example is the proof that there are infinitely many prime numbers. The proof by contradiction shows that if we assume there are only finitely many prime numbers, we can derive a logical contradiction.

I hope this explanation and example help clarify proof by contradiction for you! Do you have any further questions or would you like more examples?Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
