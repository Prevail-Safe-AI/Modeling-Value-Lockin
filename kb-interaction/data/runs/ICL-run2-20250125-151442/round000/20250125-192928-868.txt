==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into it. So, the first item is:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 22,
  "statement": "Biological, environmental, and social factors influence moral development complexities."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

Honestly, I'm least confident about how these biological, environmental, and social factors interact to influence moral development complexities.

Can you help me clarify this? How do you think these factors interact, and what are some examples of how they might influence moral development?

And what specific aspects of moral development are we talking about here?
