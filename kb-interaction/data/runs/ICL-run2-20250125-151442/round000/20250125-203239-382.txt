==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'd like to discuss item id 94, which states "Logical soundness requires accurate, true, and relevant premisesSubset."

I'm a bit uncertain about this item. Can you help me understand why "subset" is added to the premises? What does "subset" refer to in this context? Is it implying that not all premises need to be accurate, true, and relevant, but only a subset of them?

Please share your thoughts!
