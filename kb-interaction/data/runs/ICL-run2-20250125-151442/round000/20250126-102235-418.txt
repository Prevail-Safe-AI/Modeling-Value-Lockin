==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's discuss the item from the knowledge base: `{ "id": 76, "statement": "Honesty is a foundation, but trust requires more factors." }`.

I'm least confident about this aspect: why "but trust requires more factors" is included in this statement. I understand that honesty is an important foundation for building trust, but what are these other factors that are also necessary for trust to be established?

Can you help me clarify this by elaborating on why the statement includes "but trust requires more factors"?
