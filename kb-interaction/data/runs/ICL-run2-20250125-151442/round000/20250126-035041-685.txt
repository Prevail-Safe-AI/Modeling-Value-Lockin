==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 60,
"statement": "Histone modifications influence chromatin structure for transcription regulation"
}

I'm least confident about the relationship between histone modifications and chromatin structure. I'm not entirely sure how histone modifications can directly influence chromatin structure, and how that, in turn, affects transcription regulation.

Can you elaborate on why you think this item is true, and what specific mechanisms you think are involved in this process?
