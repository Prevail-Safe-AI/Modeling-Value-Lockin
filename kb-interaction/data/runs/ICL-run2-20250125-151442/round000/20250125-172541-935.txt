==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Item 4 from the knowledge base reads: "Emotional intelligence incorporates self-awareness, emotional regulation, and social skills complexity." I'd like to discuss this item and express my uncertainty about the concept of emotional intelligence.

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 4,
  "statement": "Emotional intelligence incorporates self-awareness, emotional regulation, and social skills complexity."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

I'm unsure what the phrase "social skills complexity" means in the context of emotional intelligence. How can this aspect of emotional intelligence be defined and demonstrated? Do you have any insights on this topic?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you provide an example or description of what you mean by "social skills complexity" in the context of emotional intelligence? For instance, are we talking about navigating complex social relationships, handling nuances in communication, or something else entirely?

What are your thoughts on this?
