==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by saying that I'm least confident about the item:

{
"id": 69,
"statement": "Empathy development involves complex interplay between multiple factors."
}

I'm unsure about what exactly are these "multiple factors" that contribute to empathy development. Are they exclusively biological, environmental, or are there other factors at play?

What are your thoughts on this?
