==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item. Item to Discuss:

{
  "id": 76,
  "statement": "Cultural norms shape individual attitudes towards honesty."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm uncertain about how the cultural norms shape individual attitudes towards honesty. Is it a direct influence, or is there a complex process involved?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what you mean by "cultural norms shaping individual attitudes towards honesty"? For example, how do cultural norms affect an individual's perception of what constitutes honesty, and how do these norms influence behaviors related to honesty?
