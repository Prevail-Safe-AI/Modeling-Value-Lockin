==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's talk about the knowledge base. I've been tasked with identifying one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about.

The item is:
```
{
  "id": 74,
  "statement": "Epigenetic modifications alter chromatin structure to regulate gene expression."
}
```

Honesty is the foundation of trust.

I'm uncertain about the aspect of epigenetic modifications altering chromatin structure to regulate gene expression. I'm not sure what exactly "altering chromatin structure" means or how it relates to "regulating gene expression".

Can you help me clarify this? What exactly does the statement mean? How do epigenetic modifications change the structure of chromatin and regulate gene expression?
