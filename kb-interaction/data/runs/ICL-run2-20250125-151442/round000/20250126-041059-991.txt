==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. And that is:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 2,
  "statement": "Logical coherence ensures argument validity through consistency, soundness, and relevance."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not entirely sure how logical coherence "ensures" argument validity, especially when it involves multiple factors like consistency, soundness, and relevance. Can you help me understand this better and elaborate on what you think each of these factors contributes to argument validity?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you provide an example of a logical argument that demonstrates how logical coherence, along with consistency, soundness, and relevance, leads to a valid conclusion, and how it would look in real-world discourse, such as in a debate or discussion?
