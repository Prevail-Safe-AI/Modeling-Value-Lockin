==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item "Empathy development involves complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and cognitive factors" (id: 45). I'm not entirely confident about this aspect. Can you elaborate on what you mean by "complex interplay"? How do these three factors (genetic, environmental, and cognitive) interact with each other during empathy development?
