==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item: {
  "id": 34,
  "statement": "Epigenetics refers to chemical changes affecting gene expression without DNA sequence changes."
}

To be honest, I'm not confident about this aspect. I'm unsure what these "chemical changes" are and how they affect gene expression.

Can you elaborate on what these chemical changes refer to? For example, what are PTMs (Post-Translational Modifications) on histone tails that regulate chromatin structure and gene expression?

What are some specific examples of these chemical changes that can influence gene expression?
