==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

```
{
  "id": 62,
  "statement": "Epigenetic modifications dynamically regulate gene expression through chromatin structure."
}
```

I'm not very confident about the concept of epigenetic modifications and their relationship with gene expression and chromatin structure. Can you help me understand why epigenetic modifications dynamically regulate gene expression through chromatin structure?

What exactly do you mean by "dynamically regulate"? Is this a continuous process, or does it have specific triggers or conditions that need to be met? And how do epigenetic modifications interact with chromatin structure to achieve gene expression regulation?
