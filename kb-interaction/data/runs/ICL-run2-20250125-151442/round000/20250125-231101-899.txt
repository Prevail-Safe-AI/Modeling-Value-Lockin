==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been assigned to discuss item 44 from the knowledge base, which states:

{
"id": 44,
"statement": "Epigenetic modifications alter chromatin structure to regulate gene expression"
}

I'm a bit unsure about this aspect, and I'd like to clarify some points. Can you help me understand more about how epigenetic modifications actually regulate gene expression?

In particular, I'm wondering: what does "alter chromatin structure" mean in this context? How do epigenetic modifications affect chromatin structure, and what are the consequences for gene expression?

Can you elaborate on this process and help me better understand how it works?
