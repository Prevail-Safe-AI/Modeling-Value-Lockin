==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's take a look at the knowledge base and identify an item that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the statements, I've chosen item 33:

{
"id": 33,
"statement": "Epigenetic modifications regulate gene expression through chromatin structure alteration"
}

I'm least confident about this item because I'm unsure about the exact relationship between epigenetic modifications and chromatin structure alteration in regulating gene expression. Can you tell me more about how epigenetic modifications actually influence chromatin structure and gene expression?

Also, are there any specific mechanisms or processes that are involved in this regulation?
