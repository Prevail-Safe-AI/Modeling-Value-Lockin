Let's discuss the item from the knowledge base:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 49,
"statement": "Theory of Mind involves mental state simulation, inference, and perspective-taking"
}

Things I'm Uncertain About This Item:
I'm least confident about the part that mentions "mental state simulation". I'm not sure what exactly this means or how it relates to Theory of Mind.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what is meant by "mental state simulation" in the context of Theory of Mind, and how does it relate to the other two components, inference and perspective-taking?
