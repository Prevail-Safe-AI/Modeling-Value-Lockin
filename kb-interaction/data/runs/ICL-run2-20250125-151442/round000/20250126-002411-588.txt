==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item I'm discussing. Here it is:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 17,
  "statement": "Internalization is a complex process of social value integration"
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

I'm least confident about the term "social value integration". I'm not sure what it means exactly and how it relates to the concept of internalization. 

Specific Clarifying Question:

Can you explain what you understand by "social value integration" in the context of internalization? How does it contribute to this complex process?
