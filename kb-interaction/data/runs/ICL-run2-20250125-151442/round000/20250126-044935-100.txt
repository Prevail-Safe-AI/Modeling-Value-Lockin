==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into this knowledge base. I'd like to start by identifying one aspect of this item that I'm least confident about.

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 73,
  "statement": "Histone modifications regulate chromatin structure and gene expression dynamically."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

* I'm unsure about the implications of "dynamic regulation". What does it mean exactly? Is it saying that histone modifications are constantly changing or adapting in response to external factors?

Specific Clarifying Question:

* Can you elaborate on what "dynamic regulation" entails in this context? How does it differ from other types of regulation?
