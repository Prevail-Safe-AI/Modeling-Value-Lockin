==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying an aspect of this knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the statements, I've chosen item 58:

"Epigenetic modifications regulate chromatin structure influencing gene expression pathways"

I'm uncertain about this item because I'm not familiar with the specific mechanisms by which epigenetic modifications regulate gene expression pathways. I understand that epigenetic modifications can affect gene expression, but I'm not sure how they exactly influence the chromatin structure and ultimately the gene expression pathways.

Can you help me understand this better? Maybe ask me a clarifying question about it.
