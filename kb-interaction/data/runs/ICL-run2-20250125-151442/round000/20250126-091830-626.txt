==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let me start. I'm going to choose an item from the knowledge base to discuss. I've chosen item 73:

{
"id": 73,
"statement": "\u03c0-\u03c0 stacking is a non-covalent interaction in DNA structure."
}

I'm a bit uncertain about this item. Specifically, I'm not sure what "π-π stacking" refers to, and how it relates to DNA structure. Can you help me clarify what it means?
