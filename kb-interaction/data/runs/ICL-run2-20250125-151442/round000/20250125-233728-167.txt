==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the task.

I'm supposed to identify an aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the statement, I've come across item #23:

"Social learning influences identity formation through observation and imitation."

I'm not entirely sure about the idea that social learning solely influences identity formation through observation and imitation. What do you think? Can you shed some light on this?

Also, I have a question: Can you tell me more about how social learning plays a role in shaping individual identity? Is it a one-way process, or are there other factors at play as well?
