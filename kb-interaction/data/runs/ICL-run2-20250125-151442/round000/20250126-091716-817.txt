==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, according to this knowledge base, empathy involves understanding, recognizing, and validating others' emotional experiences. But when I read this item, I couldn't help but think that "emotionally resonating with others' emotions" is a bit unclear to me.

Can you elaborate on what you think emotionally resonating means in this context? Is it about feeling the same emotions as the other person, or is it something more nuanced?

Also, what do you think is the relationship between these three components: understanding, recognizing, and validating? Are they hierarchical, or do they work together to achieve empathy?
