So, let's dive into the knowledge base. I've identified one item that caught my attention: `{'id': 37, 'statement': 'Gravity causes objects with mass to attract one another.'}`

What is it about this statement that you're most confident about?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

The statement about gravity causing objects with mass to attract each other is a fundamental concept in physics, and I'm most confident about the empirical evidence that supports it. The theory of gravity, developed by Sir Isaac Newton and later refined by Albert Einstein, has been extensively tested and validated through numerous experiments and observations. The gravitational attraction between objects has been directly measured and observed in various contexts, including the motion of planets, stars, and galaxies.
