==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm a large language model, I don't have personal feelings or emotions, but I can provide information on the topic. As for the aspect of acknowledging and learning from past wrongs, I'd say that it's often the most challenging part for many people. It requires a high level of self-awareness, humility, and emotional maturity to acknowledge one's mistakes and take responsibility for them. Additionally, it can be difficult to confront the emotional pain and discomfort that often comes with acknowledging past wrongs, which is why it's a crucial step in personal growth.
