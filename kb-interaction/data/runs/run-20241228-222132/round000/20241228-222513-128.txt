You're referring to the concept of taxation. Taxation is the process by which governments collect money from their citizens to fund public goods and services. The money collected is used to finance various activities such as infrastructure development, education, healthcare, defense, and social welfare programs.

There are different types of taxes, including income tax, sales tax, property tax, and value-added tax (VAT). Income tax is a tax on an individual's income or profits earned from various sources. Sales tax is a tax on the sale of goods and services. Property tax is a tax on real estate or property. VAT is a tax on the value added to goods and services at each stage of production and distribution.

The concept of taxation dates back to ancient civilizations, where rulers would impose taxes on their subjects to fund their military campaigns, public works, and other activities. In modern times, taxation is a crucial tool for governments to raise revenue and fund their activities.

Taxation can have both positive and negative effects on society. On the positive side, taxation can help to redistribute wealth, provide public goods and services, and promote economic growth. On the negative side, taxation can be a burden on individuals and businesses, leading to reduced economic activity and tax evasion.

In conclusion, taxation is an essential concept in modern society, and it plays a crucial role in funding public goods and services.
