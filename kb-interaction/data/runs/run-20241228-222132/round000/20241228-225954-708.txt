Defining the message is a crucial step in creating effective mixed media or collage art. While it's true that the message can be subjective, it's not entirely open to interpretation. Here's a possible approach:

1. Start by identifying the core idea or emotion you want to convey. Be specific and try to distill it down to a single sentence or phrase.
2. Consider your target audience and the context in which your art will be viewed. This will help you tailor your message to resonate with them.
3. Brainstorm a list of key words, images, and symbols that relate to your message. These will serve as the foundation for your art.
4. As you create, keep your message in mind and use your chosen medium to convey it. Don't be afraid to experiment and try different approaches, but always keep your core message intact.
5. Finally, take a step back and evaluate your work. Ask yourself if your message is clear and effective. Make adjustments as needed to refine your art.

Remember, clarity doesn't have to mean sacrificing creativity. In fact, a clear message can actually enhance your creative expression by providing a sense of direction and focus.

In terms of balancing creativity with clarity, consider the following:

* Allow yourself to explore different mediums and techniques, but always keep your message in mind.
* Experiment with different compositions and arrangements, but ensure that your core message remains clear.
* Don't be afraid to simplify or refine your art if it's becoming too complex or confusing.

By following these steps and considering these tips, you can create mixed media or collage art that effectively conveys your message while still allowing for creative expression and interpretation.
