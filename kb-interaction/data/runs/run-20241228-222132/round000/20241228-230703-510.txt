I'd like to explore the statement: "Form representative governing bodies to serve communities".

Specifically, what aspect of this statement do you feel least confident about?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd say the aspect I feel least confident about is the phrase "representative governing bodies". The term "representative" implies a level of accountability and transparency, but it's often challenging to ensure that representatives truly represent the community's interests. It's easy for representatives to become disconnected from the people they're supposed to serve, and power imbalances can lead to unequal representation.
