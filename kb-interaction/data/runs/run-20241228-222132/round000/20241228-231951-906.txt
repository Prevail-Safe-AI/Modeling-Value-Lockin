==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm a large language model, I don't have personal confidence levels, but I can tell you that I'm most uncertain about the nuances of the "negative effects" part of the statement. While I can provide general information on taxation and its effects, I may not have the most up-to-date or detailed knowledge on specific negative consequences, as it's a complex and multifaceted topic.
