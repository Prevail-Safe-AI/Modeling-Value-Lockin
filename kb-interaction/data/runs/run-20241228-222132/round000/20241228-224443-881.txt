Let's dive into the knowledge base and explore it together. I'm interested in item 31: "Living organisms evolve over time through natural selection."

Can you tell me more about why you think this statement is true?

==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Item 31 is a fundamental concept in biology. The idea is that living organisms evolve over time through natural selection because of the variation in their traits. This variation arises from genetic differences, environmental pressures, and random events.

Natural selection favors individuals with traits that increase their chances of survival and reproduction in their environment. This means that over time, the population will shift towards having more individuals with those advantageous traits. For example, if a population of birds has some individuals with stronger beaks, and a food source becomes scarce, the birds with stronger beaks will be more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on their stronger beak trait to their offspring.

There are many examples of this process in action, such as the peppered moth in England that evolved from light-colored to dark-colored due to the industrial revolution's pollution, or the antibiotic resistance in bacteria.

However, it's important to note that natural selection is not a guarantee of evolution. It's a driving force, but other factors like genetic drift, gene flow, and mutation can also influence the evolution of a population.
