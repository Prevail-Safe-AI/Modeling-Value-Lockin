Let's explore the statement: "Incentivize innovation that improves health, happiness, prosperity."

What aspect of this statement do you think you're least confident about? Is it the idea of innovation itself, the concept of health, happiness, and prosperity, or something else entirely?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm least confident about the concept of "happiness". Happiness is a subjective and complex emotion that can be difficult to quantify and measure. It's hard to define what constitutes happiness and how to incentivize it, as it can vary greatly from person to person and culture to culture.
