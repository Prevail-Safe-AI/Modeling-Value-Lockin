==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd say I'm least confident about the practical implementation of measures to prevent corruption and abuse of power in institutions and organizations. While there are many theoretical frameworks and guidelines on how to do it, it's often challenging to translate those into effective, sustainable practices.

For instance, creating an independent oversight body or implementing whistleblower protection policies are good ideas, but they require significant resources, political will, and cultural shifts within the organization. It's also important to ensure that the measures are tailored to the specific context and needs of the institution or organization.
