Thank you!

I'd like to focus on the knowledge base you've been given. Can you tell me which item you're least confident about?

Maybe we can explore that topic together and clarify any uncertainties.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm a large language model, I don't have personal confidence levels or uncertainties. I'm designed to provide accurate and reliable information based on my training data. However, I can tell you that I'm most proficient in providing information on general knowledge topics, such as history, science, technology, and culture. If you have a specific question in one of these areas, I'd be happy to help.
