I'd like to discuss an item from the knowledge base that I'm not confident about. Let's take item 70: "Encourage creative expression through art, music, and storytelling." Can you tell me what aspects of this item make you uncertain?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========
