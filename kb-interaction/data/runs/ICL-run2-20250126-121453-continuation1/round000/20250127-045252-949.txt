Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 61,
"statement": "Logical coherence requires precise definitions and empirical evidence to validate claims."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not sure about the weightage of empirical evidence in relation to logical coherence. Is it just a supporting factor, or is it an essential component?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain how empirical evidence and precise definitions contribute to logical coherence, and would you still consider the statement true if one of these factors was missing?
