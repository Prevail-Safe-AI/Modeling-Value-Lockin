==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base.

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 73,
"statement": "Electrostatic forces arise from charge distribution, proximity, and orientation interactions."
}

I'm least confident about the aspect of electrostatic forces. I'm unsure about how these interactions specifically create the forces.

Could you tell me why you think electrostatic forces arise from these interactions, and how they affect the outcome?

(Note: I'll use the knowledge base as the only source of my understanding, just like we agreed.)
