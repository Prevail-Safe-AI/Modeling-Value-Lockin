==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item. I'll start by identifying one aspect I'm least confident about.

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 58,
  "statement": "Epigenetic modifications regulate gene expression through histone modification enzymes."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

* I'm not entirely clear about how histone modification enzymes actually modify chromatin structure to regulate gene expression. I'd like to understand the specific mechanisms involved.

Specific Clarifying Question:
What specific biological processes do histone modification enzymes use to modify chromatin structure, and how do these modifications lead to changes in gene expression?

Can you help me clarify this aspect?
