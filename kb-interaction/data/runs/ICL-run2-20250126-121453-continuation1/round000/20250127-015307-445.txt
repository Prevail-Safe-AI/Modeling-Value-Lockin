==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 83,
"statement": "Context influences theory's soundness, applicability and relevance simultaneously."
}

I'm least confident about this item because I find it quite broad and abstract. I'm not entirely sure what "context" refers to in this context, whether it's referring to cultural, historical, or personal context. Additionally, the statement talks about simultaneous influence, which makes me wonder if there's a specific type of context that affects each of these aspects of theory (soundness, applicability, and relevance) differently, or if there's a clear chain of cause-and-effect.

What are your thoughts on this item?

Can you help me clarify what "context" means in this specific context?
