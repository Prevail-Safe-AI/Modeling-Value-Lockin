==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item "Cognitive, social, and contextual factors interactively influence biases." (id: 88)

I'm going to be honest, I'm a bit uncertain about the relationships between these factors. Can you elaborate on what you mean by "interactively influence" biases? For example, how do cognitive factors interact with social factors to shape biases? Is it a linear process, or are there complex feedback loops involved?
