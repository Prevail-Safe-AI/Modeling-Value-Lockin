==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the knowledge base item #77, which states that "Scientists establish axioms through logical and systematic reasoning process."

I'm least confident about this aspect because I'm not sure how scientists actually arrive at these axioms. The phrase "logical and systematic reasoning process" sounds reasonable, but I'd like to understand more about what that entails in practice.

Can you elaborate on what you think this process looks like? Is it a specific methodology that scientists follow, or is it more of a general approach that varies from scientist to scientist?
