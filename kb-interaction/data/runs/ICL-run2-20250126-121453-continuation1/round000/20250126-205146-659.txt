==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 63,
"statement": "Cultural norms are influenced by multiple intertwined factors."
}

I'm least confident about this aspect: I'm not entirely sure what is meant by "multiple intertwined factors". Could you elaborate on what these factors are?

What are some examples of these intertwined factors? Are they related to history, psychology, sociology, economics, or something else?
