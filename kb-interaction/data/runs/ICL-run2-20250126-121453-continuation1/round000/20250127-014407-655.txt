==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 42: "Contextual relevance influences theoretical soundness over internal coherence."

I'm not confident about this aspect of the knowledge base. Can you elaborate on why you think contextual relevance would influence theoretical soundness over internal coherence? What do you mean by "influence" and how does this compare to internal coherence?

Also, could you provide an example to illustrate this concept? I want to better understand the relationship between these two concepts and how they interact with theoretical soundness.

Please enlighten me!
