==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 87. The statement "Dielectric constant, polarization, and conductivity impact electrostatic forces differently." I'm not very confident about this aspect.

I'm uncertain about how each of these factors (dielectric constant, polarization, and conductivity) actually impact electrostatic forces. For example, how do they interact with each other, and what are the specific differences in their effects on electrostatic forces? I'd love some clarification on how these factors influence electrostatic forces in different materials.

Can you help me understand this better?
