==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'd like to start by exploring the statement: "Internal influences on trust include personal biases and emotions." (Item ID: 34)

I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect. Can you help me understand why personal biases and emotions are considered internal influences on trust? Is there something specific that makes them play a role in shaping trust?

And what do you mean by "personal biases"? Are you referring to implicit biases, stereotypes, or something else?
