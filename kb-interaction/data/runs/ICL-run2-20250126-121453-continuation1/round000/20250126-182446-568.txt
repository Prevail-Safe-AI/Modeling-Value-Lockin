==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base! I've chosen an item that I'm least confident about, which is:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 41,
  "statement": "Data quality in peer review includes accuracy, precision, reliability, consistency"
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

* Are these four aspects of data quality mutually exclusive or are there overlapping concepts?

Specific Clarifying Question:
What would you say defines the relationship between these four aspects of data quality in peer review? Are they cumulative, or can a dataset have, say, high accuracy but low reliability?

What are your thoughts?
