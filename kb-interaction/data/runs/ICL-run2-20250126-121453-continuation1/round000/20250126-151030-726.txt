==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the statement:

"Electrostatic forces arise from charge, distance, and orientation patterns"

I'm not very confident about that aspect. I'm unsure about how these three factors - charge, distance, and orientation - actually interact to produce electrostatic forces. I'm not clear about what kind of relationships they have, or how they affect each other.

Can you help me understand that better?
