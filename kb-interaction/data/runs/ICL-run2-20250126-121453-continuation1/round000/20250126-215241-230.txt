==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'd like to discuss the statement:

`{ "id": 85, "statement": "Electric orientation affects electrostatic force strength and direction." }`

I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect. The statement seems to suggest that the electric orientation between two charges has an impact on the strength and direction of the electrostatic force between them. However, I'm not entirely confident about how this works.

Can you help me understand this better? What does the term "electric orientation" mean in this context? How exactly does it affect the electrostatic force?
