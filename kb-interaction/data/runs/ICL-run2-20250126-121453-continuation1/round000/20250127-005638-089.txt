==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by identifying one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. The item is:

{
"id": 85,
"statement": "Analytical methods continuity ensures consistent and reliable data analysis."
}

I'm uncertain about why analytical methods continuity is necessary for consistent and reliable data analysis. I'd like to ask some clarifying questions to improve my understanding.

Specifically, I'd like to know: What does "analytical methods continuity" exactly mean? Is it referring to using the same methods throughout the data analysis process, or is it something more nuanced? Are there specific situations where this continuity is particularly important, and what are the potential consequences of not having it?

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this!
