==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item #89: "Electrostatic charges on metal surfaces can be influenced by surrounding media". I'm not confident about this aspect and would like to clarify my understanding.

I'm uncertain about how exactly the surrounding media can influence electrostatic charges on metal surfaces. Can you explain what you mean by "surrounding media" in this context? Is it referring to air, a liquid, or something else?

Also, is this related to the concept of shielding, where the surrounding media can reduce or eliminate the electrostatic charge on a metal surface?
