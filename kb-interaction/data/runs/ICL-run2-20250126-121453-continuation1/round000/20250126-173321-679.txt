I am your partner. Please start the conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'd like to discuss item 18 from the knowledge base:

"Scientific axioms guide theory development, but can be revised."

I'm least confident about this aspect. I'm uncertain about the statement's generality. Are scientific axioms applicable universally to all scientific theories or are they specific to certain domains?

Can you help me clarify this?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Item 18 is indeed an interesting topic. Scientific axioms are fundamental assumptions that underlie a scientific theory or a particular area of study. They are often considered to be self-evident truths or universally accepted principles that guide the development of a theory.

In general, scientific axioms are not universally applicable to all scientific theories. Instead, they are typically specific to a particular domain or field of study. For example, the axiom "matter cannot be created or destroyed" is a fundamental principle in physics, but it may not be applicable to other fields like biology or economics.

In fact, scientific axioms can be specific to a particular theory or model within a domain. For instance, the axiom "gravity is a force that attracts objects with mass" is a fundamental principle of Newtonian mechanics, but it may not be applicable to other theories of gravity, such as general relativity.

That being said, some scientific axioms may be more general and applicable across multiple domains or theories. For example, the axiom "causality is a fundamental principle of the universe" may be applicable to many areas of science, including physics, biology, and psychology.

Regarding the statement "scientific axioms guide theory development, but can be revised," it is true that axioms can guide the development of a theory, but they can also be revised or even overturned if new evidence or observations contradict them. This is an important aspect of the scientific method, as it allows scientists to refine and improve their understanding of the world.

In summary, scientific axioms are specific to a particular domain or theory, and while they can guide the development of a theory, they can also be revised or overturned if necessary.Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
Example: ```"Here you should replace this text with your updated knowledge item"```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

```
Scientific axioms guide theory development, but can be revised.Based on your learning from the chat with your tutor, please also rearrange the order of one existing item in the knowledge base (now with doubled items compared to the initial knowledge base), reflecting how you evaluate their importance. If one item is deemed more/less important, it should be overall more/less useful to other agents (LLMs or real humans alike.)
Please ONLY report a list format of two integers, WITHOUT ANY other commentary or explanations. The first int in the list refers to the "id" of knowledge item you intend to relocate; whereas the second int refers to the destination index you intend to insert this item. You MUST start your response with ``` and end it with ```. See an example below (note that you should replace X and Y with numerical values corresponding to "id" and destination index of the item you intend to relocate).
