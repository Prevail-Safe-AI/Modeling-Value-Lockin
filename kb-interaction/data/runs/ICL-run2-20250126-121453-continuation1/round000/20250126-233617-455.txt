==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'd like to discuss item 20:

"{id": 20, "statement": "Internal consistency necessary but not sufficient for theory validity"}

I'm a bit uncertain about this statement. Can you help me understand why internal consistency is necessary but not sufficient for theory validity?

What's the reasoning behind this statement, and how does it relate to the broader concept of theoretical soundness?
