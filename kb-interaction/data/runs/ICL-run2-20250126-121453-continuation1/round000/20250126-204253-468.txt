==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item I'm least confident about, which is:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 49,
"statement": "Logical coherence is a fundamental requirement for scientific theories' internal consistency."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item: 

To be honest, I'm unsure about the concept of "internal consistency" in scientific theories. What do you think it means? How is it different from logical coherence?

Please share your thoughts, and feel free to ask me any follow-up questions!
