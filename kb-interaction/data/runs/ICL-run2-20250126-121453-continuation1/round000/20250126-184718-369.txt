==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. The item is:

```
{
  "id": 90,
  "statement": "Electrostatic force interaction depends on medium, geometry, surface properties."
}
```

I'm a bit uncertain about the extent to which these factors really influence the electrostatic force. Can you help me understand what's going on here?

What do you think about this statement? Do you think these factors have a significant impact on the electrostatic force, or is it a more complex interaction?
