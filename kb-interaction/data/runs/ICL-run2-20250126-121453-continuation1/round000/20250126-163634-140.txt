==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you! I've chosen Item 98: "Expertise develops from harmony of knowledge, skills, and experience."

I'm the least confident about this item. I'm uncertain about what is meant by "harmony" in this context. Is it just a synonym for balance or synergy among knowledge, skills, and experience? Or does it imply something more complex, such as a specific relationship or interaction between these components?

Can you help clarify this for me?
