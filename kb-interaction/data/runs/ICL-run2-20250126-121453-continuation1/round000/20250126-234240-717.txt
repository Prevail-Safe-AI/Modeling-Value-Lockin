==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Based on the knowledge base, I've identified the item that I'm least confident about. I'd like to discuss item 46:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 46,
"statement": "Fundamental theories rely on ongoing empirical validation for refinement."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
* I'm not entirely clear on what is meant by "ongoing empirical validation". Is it a specific process or set of methods that are used to continually validate and refine fundamental theories?

Specific Clarifying Question:
What process or methods are typically used for ongoing empirical validation of fundamental theories, and how does this process ensure that the theories remain accurate and relevant over time?
