==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 72:

{
"id": 72,
"statement": "Iterative refinement is a cyclical process of continuous improvement"
}

What's your take on this statement? Do you think it accurately captures the concept of iterative refinement?

I'm a bit uncertain about this item because I'm not sure what a "cyclical process of continuous improvement" means in this context. Is it implying that refinement is a never-ending loop, or is there a specific limit to the number of refinements? Can you clarify this for me?
