==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item: 

```
{
  "id": 72,
  "statement": "Research validity involves internal, external, and construct validity measures."
}
```

I'm least confident about this item because I'm not entirely clear on what it means by "internal, external, and construct validity measures". Can you help me understand what those terms mean in the context of research validity? Specifically, how do they relate to each other and how are they used to assess research validity?

What are your thoughts on this?
