==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. And the item is:

{
"id": 22,
"statement": "Clear definitions ensure coherence through precision and consistency"
}

I'm uncertain about whether clear definitions really do ensure coherence, precision, and consistency automatically. Can you help me understand why the statement might be true or false?

(Note: I'll wait for your response before elaborating on my uncertainty and formulating specific clarifying questions.)
