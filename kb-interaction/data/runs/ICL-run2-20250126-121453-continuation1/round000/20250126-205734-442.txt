==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item I'm least confident about, which is:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 48,
"statement": "Cultural norms shaped by intricate interactions of history, social structure, and economy."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not entirely sure how cultural norms are shaped by these three factors, and how they interact with each other. It seems complex and nuanced.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand how these three factors - history, social structure, and economy - interact and influence each other to shape cultural norms? For example, how does the history of a society affect its social structure, and how does the economy influence the relationships between individuals and groups within that society?
