==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item "Electrostatic force depends on medium's dielectric constant, conductivity, and permittivity." (ID: 36)

I'm least confident about this item. To be honest, I'm not entirely sure what "permittivity" is in the context of electrostatic forces, and how it's related to dielectric constant and conductivity. Can you explain what permittivity refers to and how it affects electrostatic forces?

Can you elaborate on how these three properties (dielectric constant, conductivity, and permittivity) influence electrostatic forces?
