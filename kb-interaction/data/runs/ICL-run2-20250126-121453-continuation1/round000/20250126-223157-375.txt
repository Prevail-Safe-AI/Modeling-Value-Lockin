==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's talk about the item from the knowledge base. The statement is: "Electric field orientation determines electrostatic force direction". I'm least confident about this aspect because I'm not sure how the electric field orientation exactly affects the direction of the electrostatic force.

Uncertainty A: I'm unclear about how the electric field's direction influences the force. Does it depend on the type of charge involved? Is it a straightforward relationship or is there more to it?

Can you help me understand this better?
