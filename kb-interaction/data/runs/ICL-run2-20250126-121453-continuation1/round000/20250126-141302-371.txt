==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been assigned to talk about the item from the knowledge base with you. The item is:

{
"id": 14,
"statement": "Empathy fosters trust through active listening, validation, and rapport"
}

I have to identify one aspect of this item that I'm least confident about. Upon reviewing the item, I'm most uncertain about the concept of "rapport". Can you please help me understand what rapport means in this context?

What is rapport in the context of empathy and trust building? How does it contribute to fostering trust?
