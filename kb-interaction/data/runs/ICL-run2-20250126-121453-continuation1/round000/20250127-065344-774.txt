==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the topic. I'm looking at item 70, which states that "Internal consistency is necessary but insufficient for logical soundness."

I'm slightly uncertain about this aspect. Can you elaborate on why you think internal consistency is necessary but not sufficient for logical soundness?

In other words, what's missing from internal consistency that makes it "insufficient" for logical soundness?
