==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's discuss the knowledge base item:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 81,
"statement": "Peer review evaluates research for validity, relevance, practical impact"
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm unsure about the interpretation of "practical impact" in the context of peer review.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what the authors mean by "practical impact"? How does it differ from "relevance", and what kind of impact are they talking about? For example, are they talking about the potential applications of the research, the potential benefits to society, or something else entirely?
