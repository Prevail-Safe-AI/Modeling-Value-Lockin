==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'd like to discuss item:

{
"id": 35,
"statement": "Electrostatic interactions involve multiple forces, including ion-ion, exchange, induction, and dispersion."
}

I'm least confident about this aspect: the nature of the "exchange" force mentioned in the statement.

I'm unsure what exactly is meant by "exchange" force in the context of electrostatic interactions. Is it a type of force that arises between charged particles, similar to ion-ion or induction forces? Or is it something more specific, like a force that involves the movement or exchange of particles?

Can you help me better understand what is meant by the "exchange" force in this context?
