==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd love to discuss item 99, which states that "Rigorous research methods ensure research credibility and trustworthiness." I'm least confident about this aspect because I'm not entirely sure how rigorous research methods directly impact the credibility and trustworthiness of research.

Can you help me understand why this connection is made? For example, how do rigorous research methods specifically contribute to ensuring credibility and trustworthiness? Is it because they help eliminate bias, ensure data accuracy, or something else entirely?
