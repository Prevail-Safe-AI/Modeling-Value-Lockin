==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item we're discussing: {{ "id": 98, "statement": "Electrostatic forces depend on charge, distance, orientation, and 3D spatial arrangement patterns." }}.

I'm least confident about the aspect of "3D spatial arrangement patterns". Can you elaborate on what you think this means and how it affects electrostatic forces?

Also, are there any specific concepts or math involved in this aspect that you're not comfortable with?
