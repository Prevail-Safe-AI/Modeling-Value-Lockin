==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base and discuss Item 31, which states: "Electrostatic force depends on medium's dielectric constant, conductivity, and permittivity."

I'm least confident about this aspect because I'm not entirely sure what these terms mean in the context of electrostatic forces. I've heard of dielectric constants and permittivity, but I'm not sure how they relate to conductivity and electrostatic forces.

Can you help me understand what these terms mean and how they affect electrostatic forces?
