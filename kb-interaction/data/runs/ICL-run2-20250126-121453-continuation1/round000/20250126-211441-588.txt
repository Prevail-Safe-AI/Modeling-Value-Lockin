==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item I'm least confident about, which is:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 17,
  "statement": "Permittivity measures material's response to electric field distortion."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

I'm not entirely sure what "electric field distortion" means in this context. Is it related to the distortion of the electric field around a charged particle or a material? Or is it more related to how the material responds to changes in the electric field?

Specific Clarifying Question:

Could you please explain what "electric field distortion" means in this context, and how it relates to permittivity?
