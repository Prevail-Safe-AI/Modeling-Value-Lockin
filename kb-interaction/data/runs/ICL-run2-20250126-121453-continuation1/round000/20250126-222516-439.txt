==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thanks for being willing to discuss it with me.

Okay, so I'd like to start by saying that I'm least confident about the statement: "Honesty's moral justifiability depends on context and values." (Item 98)

I'm uncertain about this aspect because... well, to me, honesty seems like a fundamental value that should always be held in high regard, regardless of the context or situation. I'm not sure how I would apply this concept in real-life situations, especially when dealing with complex moral dilemmas.

Can you elaborate on why you think honesty's moral justifiability depends on context and values? How do you think this concept applies to everyday life?
