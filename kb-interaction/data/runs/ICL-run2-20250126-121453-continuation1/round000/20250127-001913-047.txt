==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item I'm interested in, which is:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 63,
  "statement": "Theoretical soundness involves internal coherence, empirical validation, and external verification"
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm least confident about how internal coherence relates to empirical validation and external verification in achieving theoretical soundness.

Specifically, I'm wondering how internal coherence, which seems to be about consistency within the theoretical framework, contributes to the overall soundness of the theory. Is it simply a necessary condition, or does it have a more direct impact on empirical validation and external verification?

Can you help me understand this better?
