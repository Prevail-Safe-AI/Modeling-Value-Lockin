Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

After reviewing the knowledge base, I'd say I'm least confident about item #90: "Philosophical truths can be grounded by non-empirical evidence." This statement seems to contradict the idea that philosophical truths require empirical evidence, which is mentioned in item #1. I'm not sure how to reconcile these two statements, and I'd love to discuss this further with you!
