==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by asking about the item we're discussing:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 80,
  "statement": "Internal consistency varies across theories, contexts, domains due to assumptions."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

To be honest, I'm a bit uncertain about the last part of this statement: "due to assumptions". What do you think it means by "assumptions"? Are we talking about assumptions made in the development of the theories, contexts, or domains? Or are we talking about some other type of assumption?

Can you help me clarify this part of the statement?
