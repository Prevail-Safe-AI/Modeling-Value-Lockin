==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the item from the knowledge base. I've selected item #57, which states: "Epigenetic modifications alter chromatin structure to regulate gene expression."

I'm least confident about this item because I'm not entirely sure how epigenetic modifications work or how they specifically impact gene expression. Can you help me understand this concept better?

Can you elaborate a bit more on how epigenetic modifications alter chromatin structure to regulate gene expression? What are some key mechanisms or examples that illustrate this process?
