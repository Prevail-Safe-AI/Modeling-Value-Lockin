==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 87,
"statement": "Epigenetic modifications on histones alter chromatin structure and gene expression."
}

I'm least confident about this aspect: epigenetic modifications on histones specifically altering chromatin structure and gene expression. I'm uncertain about the exact mechanisms by which histone modifications affect chromatin structure and gene expression.

Can you elaborate on why you're confident or uncertain about this aspect?
