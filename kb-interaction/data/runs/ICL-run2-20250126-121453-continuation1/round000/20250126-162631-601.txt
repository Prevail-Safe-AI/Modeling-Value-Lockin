==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I chose the item with ID 94: "Honesty is a fundamental principle in moral frameworks." I'm a bit uncertain about this item because I wasn't aware that honesty is considered a fundamental principle in moral frameworks. I thought honesty was more of an individual values or norms, and it doesn't seem to be explicitly stated in the other items in the knowledge base.

Specifically, I'd like to know more about the context in which this principle is considered fundamental. Are there any specific moral frameworks or theories that subscribe to this view? And how is this principle distinguished from other moral principles or values that are also considered important?

What are your thoughts on this item?
