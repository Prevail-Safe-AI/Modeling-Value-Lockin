==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the statement "Underlying assumptions can influence theory development and application subtly." I'm least confident about this item, and I'd like to know more about it.

I'm uncertain about how underlying assumptions can influence theory development and application in such a subtle way. Can you elaborate on what you mean by "subtly"? Can you give an example of where this has happened in a real-world context?

What do you think?
