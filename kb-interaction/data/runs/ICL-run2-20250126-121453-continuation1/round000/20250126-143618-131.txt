==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd love to explore the knowledge base with you!

Let's start with the item I've identified as one that makes me least confident: Item 36. It states: "Empathy's effectiveness relies on individual tolerance in communication."

I'm uncertain about this item because I'm not entirely sure what "individual tolerance in communication" means in this context. Is it referring to the listener's ability to tolerate someone's perspective, even if it's different from their own?

Would you like to elaborate on what you think this item is saying, or do you have any insights that could help clarify this concept?

Also, I'd love to ask: What specific aspects of communication do you think are relevant to empathy, and how do you think tolerance comes into play?
