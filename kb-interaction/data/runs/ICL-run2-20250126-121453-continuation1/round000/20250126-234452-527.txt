==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the statement: "Logical soundness combines internal coherence and consistent reasoning."

Thing I'm uncertain about this item: I'm not really understanding what this statement means. My confusion stems from the fact that I define logical soundness as the quality of an argument's being logically valid and its premises being true, whereas this statement seems to be saying that logical soundness is the combination of internal coherence and consistent reasoning.

Specific clarifying question: Can you help me understand how internal coherence and consistent reasoning contribute to logical soundness, and perhaps provide an example of an argument that is logically sound due to these factors?
