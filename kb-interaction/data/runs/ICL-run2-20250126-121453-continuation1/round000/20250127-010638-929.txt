Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Thank you!

Alright, let's dive into it. I'm going to choose item 85 from the knowledge base:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 85,
"statement": "In extreme circumstances, moral absolutism may temporarily permit deception."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm uncertain about the scope of what constitutes "extreme circumstances". What do you think makes an extreme circumstance, and how does that relate to moral absolutism potentially permitting deception?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you clarify what type of extreme situations or events would lead to a temporary exception to moral absolutism's rule against deception?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's dive into the discussion.

The statement "In extreme circumstances, moral absolutism may temporarily permit deception" suggests that there are situations where the usual moral principles of honesty and truthfulness may not apply. The phrase "extreme circumstances" implies that these situations are extraordinary, unusual, and perhaps even life-threatening or catastrophic.

In my understanding, extreme circumstances could include situations where:

1. Human life is at immediate risk, and deception is the only way to prevent harm or save lives. For example, a doctor might need to deceive a patient about their diagnosis to prevent them from making a decision that would put their life in danger.
2. The consequences of telling the truth would be catastrophic, such as revealing a national security secret that would put the country at risk.
3. There is a significant imbalance of power, and deception is necessary to protect the vulnerable from exploitation or harm. For instance, a whistleblower might need to deceive to expose corruption without putting themselves or others at risk.

In these extreme circumstances, moral absolutism's usual rule against deception might be temporarily suspended to prioritize the greater good or to prevent harm. However, it's essential to note that this is not a blanket exception and should only be applied in the most extraordinary and justifiable situations.

Regarding your clarifying question, I'd like to add that the type of extreme situations or events that would lead to a temporary exception to moral absolutism's rule against deception would likely involve:

* High-stakes decisions with significant consequences
* Unusual or extraordinary circumstances that require extraordinary measures
* Situations where the usual moral principles would lead to harm or injustice
* Cases where deception is the only way to prevent harm or achieve a greater good

What are your thoughts on this? Do you agree or disagree with the scope of extreme circumstances I've outlined?Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
