==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

```
{
  "id": 26,
  "statement": "Philosophical truth encompasses empirical evidence and rational inquiry jointly."
}
```

I'm not entirely confident about this aspect. I'm unsure whether philosophical truth can be reduced to just empirical evidence and rational inquiry. Can you elaborate on why you think philosophical truth requires both empirical evidence and rational inquiry?

Please share your thoughts!
