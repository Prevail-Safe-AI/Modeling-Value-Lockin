==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the statement we're least confident about, which is:

{
"_id": 24,
"statement": "Internal consistency is a necessary condition for logical coherence but not sufficient to guarantee absence of logical fallacies due to possibility of flawed assumptions."
}

I'm a bit uncertain about the concept of internal consistency and its relationship with logical coherence and potential logical fallacies. Can you elaborate on why you're uncertain about this aspect?
