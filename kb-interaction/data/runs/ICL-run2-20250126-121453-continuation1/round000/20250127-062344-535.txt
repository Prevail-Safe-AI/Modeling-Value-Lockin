==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's discuss the item from the knowledge base: `{ "id": 77, "statement": "Theoretical validity refers to a theory's accuracy and logical coherence." }`.

I'm not confident about this aspect because I'm wondering how "accuracy" relates to theoretical validity. Isn't accuracy a characteristic of empirical evidence, whereas theoretical validity is more concerned with the logical structure and soundness of the theory?

Can you help me clarify this point?
