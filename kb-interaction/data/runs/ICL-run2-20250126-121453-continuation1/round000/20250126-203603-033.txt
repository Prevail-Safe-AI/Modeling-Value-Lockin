==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, I'd like to discuss the item from the knowledge base that I've been assigned to talk about, which is:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 36,
"statement": "Logical coherence is an essential but not sole driver of credibility."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not entirely sure what is meant by "sole driver of credibility". Could you help me understand what that phrase is trying to convey?

Specific Clarifying Question:
How would you define "sole driver of credibility", and what does it mean for logical coherence to be "not sole" in determining credibility?
