==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item:
```
{
  "id": 51,
  "statement": "Internal consistency ensures logical soundness, truth-preservation, and coherence"
}
```

I'm a bit uncertain about this item. One thing that's unclear to me is how "internal consistency" specifically ensures "logical soundness, truth-preservation, and coherence". 

Can you elaborate on what you think "internal consistency" means in this context?
