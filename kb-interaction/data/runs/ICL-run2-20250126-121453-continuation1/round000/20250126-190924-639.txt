==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. 

I'd like to discuss the statement:

"Scientific axioms are foundational principles based on deep understanding."

Specifically, I'm not too confident about this aspect.

I'm uncertain because I'm not clear about what "deep understanding" means in this context. Does it refer to a specific level of understanding, like a certain number of studies or experiments, or is it more of a qualitative concept, like a gut feeling? 

Here's a specific clarifying question I'd like to ask:

Can you provide an example of a scientific axiom that is based on "deep understanding" and what features make it so?
