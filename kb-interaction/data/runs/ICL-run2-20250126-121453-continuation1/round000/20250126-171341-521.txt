==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 35,
"statement": "Cultural norms, social context, personal experiences, and norms shape honesty perceptions."
}

I'm most uncertain about the scope of the statement. How do you interpret the phrase "shape honesty perceptions"? Can you elaborate on what kind of impact cultural norms, social context, personal experiences, and norms have on someone's understanding of honesty? Are we talking about a specific context, such as workplace or personal relationships?
