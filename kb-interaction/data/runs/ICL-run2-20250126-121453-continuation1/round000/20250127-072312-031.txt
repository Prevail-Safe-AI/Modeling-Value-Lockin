==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've chosen an item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. It is:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 3,
  "statement": "Internal consistency meaning varies across theoretical frameworks."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

I'm not sure why internal consistency might vary across theoretical frameworks. It seems like internal consistency would be a fundamental concept that applies universally, regardless of the theoretical framework. Can you help me understand why this might not be the case?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what specific differences between theoretical frameworks might lead to variations in the meaning of internal consistency?
