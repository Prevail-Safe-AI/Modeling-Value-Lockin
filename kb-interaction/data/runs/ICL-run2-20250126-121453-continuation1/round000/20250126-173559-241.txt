==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item. I've selected one aspect of the item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about, which is:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 8,
  "statement": "Peer review evaluates research for validity, significance, and practical application."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm unsure about what "practical application" means in this context. Are we talking about the potential uses or applications of the research findings, or the actual implementation of the research methods or techniques in real-world scenarios?

Specific Clarifying Question:
What is meant by "practical application" in peer review, and how does it differ from or relate to the concepts of "significance" and "validity"?

What are your thoughts on this?
