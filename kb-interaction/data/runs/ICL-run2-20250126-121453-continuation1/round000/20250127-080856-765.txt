==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss Item 19 from the knowledge base:

{
"id": 19,
"statement": "Internal coherence is a necessary condition for theoretical validity."
}

I'm least confident about this statement. I'd like to know more about why internal coherence is considered a necessary condition for theoretical validity.

Can you help me understand what's behind this claim? What is theoretical validity, and how does internal coherence guarantee it?
