==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's discuss the item from the knowledge base:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 44,
  "statement": "Honesty is a universally accepted moral principle, prescribed by reason."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm least confident about the claim that "honesty is a universally accepted moral principle". I'm not sure what constitutes "universally accepted" in this context. Is it a majority consensus among humans? Is it a philosophy or ethics that has been widely adopted across cultures? Are there any counterexamples or historical instances where honesty wasn't valued or considered a moral principle?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what is meant by "universally accepted" in this statement, and whether there are any notable exceptions or cultural variations that would challenge this claim?
