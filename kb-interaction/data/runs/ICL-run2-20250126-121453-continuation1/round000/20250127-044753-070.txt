==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item from the provided text:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 75,
  "statement": "Complex systems' sensitivity amplifies initial condition uncertainties"
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

I'm least confident about how the concept of "sensitivity" applies to complex systems. Could you elaborate on what you mean by "sensitivity amplifies initial condition uncertainties"? How do complex systems' properties like non-linearity, feedback loops, or interconnectedness relate to this concept?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you provide an example of how sensitivity amplifies initial condition uncertainties in a complex system, perhaps from a real-world context or a theoretical framework? This would help me better understand the concept.
