==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the statement "Component interactions drive emergent properties in complex systems through dynamics." from the knowledge base. Specifically, I'm least confident about this aspect.

Things I'm Uncertain About This Item:

I'm unsure about what exactly is meant by "dynamics" in this context. Is it referring to the internal workings of the complex system, or is it more about the interactions and relationships between the components?

Can you help clarify this for me?
