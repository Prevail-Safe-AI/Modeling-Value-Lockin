==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 61 from the knowledge base:

{
"id": 61,
"statement": "Epigenetic modifications regulate gene expression through histone modification"
}

I'm least confident about the phrase "regulate gene expression". Can you elaborate on what you think this means? Are epigenetic modifications directly controlling gene expression, or is it more indirect?

Also, what is the role of histone modification in this process? Is histone modification being affected by epigenetic modifications, or is it the other way around?
