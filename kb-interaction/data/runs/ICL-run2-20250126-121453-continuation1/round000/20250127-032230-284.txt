==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thanks!

So, I'd like to discuss the item "Expert biases compromise research validity through cognitive errors" from the knowledge base. Can you help me understand this statement and identify the aspects that make you unsure or uncertain about it?

Is it the concept of "expert biases", the idea that cognitive errors can compromise research validity, or something else?
