==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start with the item:

```
{
  "id": 52,
  "statement": "Cognitive biases sharply impede human reasoning processes."
}
```

I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect. Can you elaborate on what you think cognitive biases are and how they affect human reasoning?

And also, I'd like to know more about what you think it means by "sharply impede" human reasoning processes. Can you provide some examples of how cognitive biases can hinder our thinking or decision-making?
