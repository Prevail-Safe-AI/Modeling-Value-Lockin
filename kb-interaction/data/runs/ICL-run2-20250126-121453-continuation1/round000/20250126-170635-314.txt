==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, I'd like to discuss the item "Histone modifications regulate gene expression through chromatin structure alterations." (Item 79)

I have to admit that I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect of the knowledge base. I'm unsure about the relationship between histone modifications, chromatin structure, and gene expression.

Could you help me understand this better? What are histone modifications, and how exactly do they influence chromatin structure and gene expression?

Please help enlighten me!
