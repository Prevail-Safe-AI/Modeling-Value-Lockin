==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. The item I'd like to discuss is:

{
"id": 22,
"statement": "Honesty's moral rightness depends on contextual harm/threat assessment."
}

I'm least confident about this item. I'm not sure why the moral rightness of honesty would depend on assessing harm or threats in a particular context.

Can you help me understand what this statement means? Why would the moral rightness of honesty be dependent on contextual factors? 

What do you think about this item?
