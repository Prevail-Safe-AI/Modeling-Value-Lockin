==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the knowledge base item I've been assigned. The item is:

Item to Discuss:
{
  "id": 77,
  "statement": "Dielectric constant measures a material's electric field responsiveness."
}

I'm least confident about this item. I'm unsure of what is meant by "electric field responsiveness" in this context. Can you help me understand this concept better?
