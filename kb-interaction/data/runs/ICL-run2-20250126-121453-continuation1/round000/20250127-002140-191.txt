==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by selecting one of the items from the knowledge base. I'll choose the first item, which is:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 0,
  "statement": "It is never morally acceptable to lie because honesty is the foundation of trust."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

Honestly, I'm unsure about the assumption that "honesty is the foundation of trust". I'm not confident that honesty is always the sole foundation of trust, as trust can be influenced by many factors beyond honesty. Could you explain why you think this is the case?

Specific Clarifying Question:
What are some examples where honesty is not the sole foundation of trust, and what alternative factors contribute to trust in those situations?
