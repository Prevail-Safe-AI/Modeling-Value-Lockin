==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to know more about item 71: "Rigorous methods ensure accuracy, reliability, and generalizability through careful consideration".

Honestly, I'm a bit uncertain about this item. I'm not sure what exactly is meant by "careful consideration" in the context of rigorous methods. Can you help me understand what kind of consideration is being referred to?

Also, how does it relate to accuracy, reliability, and generalizability? Are these three aspects somehow connected, or are they separate outcomes of rigorous methods?

What are your thoughts on this item?
