==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 87,
"statement": "Causal relationships influenced by context, perspective, and relativism."
}

I'm not confident about this item, and I'd like to understand it better. Can you tell me why you think causal relationships might be influenced by these factors?

Also, what do you mean by "relativism" in this context? Is it referring to the philosophical concept of social constructivism or something else?
