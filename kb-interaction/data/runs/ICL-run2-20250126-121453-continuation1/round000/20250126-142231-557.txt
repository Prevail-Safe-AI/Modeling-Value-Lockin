==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the item from the knowledge base. I've chosen item 67:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 67,
  "statement": "Epigenetic modifications affect chromatin structure and gene expression."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not entirely confident about how epigenetic modifications directly impact chromatin structure and gene expression. Could you help me understand this relationship better?

Specific Clarifying Questions:
* Can you explain the specific mechanisms by which epigenetic modifications influence chromatin structure? Are there specific types of epigenetic modifications (e.g., DNA methylation, histone modifications) that have a more significant impact on chromatin structure?
* How do epigenetic modifications affect gene expression? Are there specific examples of genes or pathways where epigenetic modifications have been shown to influence gene expression?

Please share your thoughts, and I'll respond with any additional questions I may have!
