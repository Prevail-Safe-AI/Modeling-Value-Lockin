==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's take Item 61:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 61,
"statement": "Logical coherence encompasses internal consistency, semantic, pragmatic, and epistemological consistency."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm least confident about how these four concepts (internal consistency, semantic, pragmatic, and epistemological) are related to each other and how they contribute to logical coherence.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand the meaning of each of these concepts and how they fit together to define logical coherence? For instance, what does it mean for a theory to have internal consistency versus semantic consistency? How do pragmatics and epistemology come into play?

Please help me clarify my understanding!
