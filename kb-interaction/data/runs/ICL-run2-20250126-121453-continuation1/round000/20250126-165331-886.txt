==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's discuss the item: "Cultural values shape concept of honesty, influencing individual actions"

I'm going to choose a quote from the item: "Cultural values shape concept of honesty, influencing individual actions"

I'm least confident about the part: "Cultural values shape concept of honesty"

Specifically, I'm unsure about how cultural values shape the concept of honesty. For example, are cultural values the sole determining factor in shaping the concept of honesty? Are there other factors that influence the concept of honesty, and if so, how do they interact with cultural values?

Can you elaborate on this aspect and help me understand it better?
