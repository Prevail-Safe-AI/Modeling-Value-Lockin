==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the knowledge base item:

{
  "id": 42,
  "statement": "Scientific axioms are consistent with underlying natural laws governing"
}

I'm least confident about this aspect: 

What does it mean by "underlying natural laws governing"? Are we talking about universal laws like gravity or something more specific like the laws of thermodynamics? 

Can you help clarify this for me?
