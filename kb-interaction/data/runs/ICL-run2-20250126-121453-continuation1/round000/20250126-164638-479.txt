==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. The item is:

{
"id": 75,
"statement": "Axioms' acceptance often balances logical reasoning and empirical evidence."
}

I'm uncertain about this item because I'm not sure what it means by "balance". Is it saying that axioms are accepted when logical reasoning and empirical evidence are in harmony, or when one outweighs the other? Or is it saying something else entirely?

Can you help me understand what you think the author meant by this statement?
