==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by saying that I've identified the item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about, which is:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 80,
  "statement": "Honesty is necessary but insufficient for trust foundations; vulnerability required."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm uncertain about how "vulnerability" is being used in this statement. What does it mean for someone to be vulnerable in the context of trust foundations?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what kind of vulnerability is necessary to establish trust, and how it relates to honesty being insufficient on its own?

Your thoughts?
