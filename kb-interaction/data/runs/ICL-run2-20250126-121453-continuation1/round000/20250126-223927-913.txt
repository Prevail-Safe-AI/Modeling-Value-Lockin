==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the knowledge base item:

```
{
  "id": 22,
  "statement": "Trust formation involves complex interplay of cognitive, emotional, social processes."
}
```

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 22,
  "statement": "Trust formation involves complex interplay of cognitive, emotional, social processes."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

I'm least confident about how the complex interplay of cognitive, emotional, social processes actually works in practice. I'm not entirely sure how these processes interact with each other and how they're shaped by individual experiences, cultural backgrounds, and environmental factors.

Specific Clarifying Question:

Can you help me understand how the cognitive, emotional, and social processes are interconnected and influence each other during trust formation? What specific factors or experiences can shape these processes, and how can we recognize these influences in real-life situations?
