==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been given a task to identify one aspect from the knowledge base item that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the item, I've chosen the following:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 87,
"statement": "Epigenetic modifications control gene expression through chromatin structure changes."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm unsure about how epigenetic modifications specifically control gene expression through chromatin structure changes.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain the process by which epigenetic modifications affect chromatin structure and subsequently control gene expression? For example, what specific histone modifications occur and how do they impact chromatin compaction or decompaction to regulate gene expression?

What are your thoughts on this?
