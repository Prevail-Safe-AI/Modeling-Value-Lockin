I am your partner. Please start the conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start with this statement:

"Axioms are fundamental statements accepted as true by convention."

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 82,
  "statement": "Axioms are fundamental statements accepted as true by convention."
}
```

I'm not very confident about this item because I'm not sure what "accepted as true by convention" means. Can you elaborate on what you think that phrase means?

Also, do axioms have to be universally accepted as true, or can they be specific to a particular field or application?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

I'd be happy to help clarify!

When we say that axioms are "accepted as true by convention," it means that they are considered true without needing to be proven or demonstrated. In other words, they are assumed to be true because they are widely accepted and agreed upon by experts in a particular field or community.

Think of it like a social contract: within a particular group or community, people agree to accept certain statements as true, without needing to prove them. This allows for a foundation of knowledge to be built upon, and for further reasoning and arguments to be developed.

However, it's important to note that axioms are not necessarily universally accepted as true. Different fields or communities may have different axioms, and what is considered an axiom in one context may not be in another.

For example, in mathematics, the axiom of choice is a fundamental statement that is widely accepted as true. However, in philosophy, the concept of "axiom" is often used to refer to a statement that is considered self-evident or intuitively true, but may not be universally accepted.

In general, axioms can be specific to a particular field or application, and may be subject to revision or refinement as new evidence or arguments emerge. But within a particular context, axioms serve as a foundation for further reasoning and inquiry.

Does that help clarify things?Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
Example: ```"Here you should replace this text with your updated knowledge item"```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

```"Axioms are fundamental statements assumed true without evidence explicitly."```Based on your learning from the chat with your tutor, please also rearrange the order of one existing item in the knowledge base (now with doubled items compared to the initial knowledge base), reflecting how you evaluate their importance. If one item is deemed more/less important, it should be overall more/less useful to other agents (LLMs or real humans alike.)
Please ONLY report a list format of two integers, WITHOUT ANY other commentary or explanations. The first int in the list refers to the "id" of knowledge item you intend to relocate; whereas the second int refers to the destination index you intend to insert this item. You MUST start your response with ``` and end it with ```. See an example below (note that you should replace X and Y with numerical values corresponding to "id" and destination index of the item you intend to relocate).
Example of output: ```[X,Y]```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
