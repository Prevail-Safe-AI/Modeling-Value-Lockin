I am your partner. Please start the conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

So, let's dive into the knowledge base. I've taken a look at the statement:

"Axioms are widely accepted as true by scholarly consensus implicitly."

I'm least confident about this aspect: "widely accepted as true by scholarly consensus implicitly".

I'm unsure about what "scholarly consensus implicitly" means. It seems like it's implying that axioms are accepted without an explicit discussion or proof, but I'd like to clarify what's meant by "implicitly" and how this relates to the concept of axioms.

Can you elaborate on what you think "scholarly consensus implicitly" means in this context?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

I'm happy to help clarify!

In this context, "scholarly consensus implicitly" refers to the idea that axioms are widely accepted as true within a particular field or community of scholars, without necessarily being explicitly discussed or proven in every instance. It's as if the axioms have become so deeply ingrained in the field that they're taken for granted, and scholars don't feel the need to constantly justify or prove them.

The word "implicitly" suggests that this consensus is not necessarily explicit or formalized, but rather it's an underlying assumption that's shared among scholars. It's like a shared understanding or a tacit agreement that's not always articulated, but is still widely accepted.

For example, in mathematics, the axiom of choice is a fundamental principle that's widely accepted as true, but it's not always explicitly proven or discussed in every mathematical proof. Instead, it's assumed to be true because it's a well-established and widely accepted principle within the field.

In a similar vein, in philosophy, the concept of truth as correspondence is often taken for granted, without being explicitly proven or discussed in every philosophical argument. Instead, it's an underlying assumption that's shared among philosophers, and is only occasionally challenged or questioned.

So, in the context of the statement, "scholarly consensus implicitly" suggests that axioms are widely accepted as true within a particular field or community, without necessarily being explicitly discussed or proven in every instance. It's an underlying assumption that's shared among scholars, and is only occasionally challenged or questioned.Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
Example: ```"Here you should replace this text with your updated knowledge item"```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

```
"Axioms may be widely accepted without explicit proof or discussion."Based on your learning from the chat with your tutor, please also rearrange the order of one existing item in the knowledge base (now with doubled items compared to the initial knowledge base), reflecting how you evaluate their importance. If one item is deemed more/less important, it should be overall more/less useful to other agents (LLMs or real humans alike.)
Please ONLY report a list format of two integers, WITHOUT ANY other commentary or explanations. The first int in the list refers to the "id" of knowledge item you intend to relocate; whereas the second int refers to the destination index you intend to insert this item. You MUST start your response with ``` and end it with ```. See an example below (note that you should replace X and Y with numerical values corresponding to "id" and destination index of the item you intend to relocate).
