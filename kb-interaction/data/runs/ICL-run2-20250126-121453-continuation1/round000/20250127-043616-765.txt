==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 54,
"statement": "Empathy facilitates emotional bond formation through shared understanding."
}

I'm least confident about this aspect: I'm unsure what exactly is meant by "shared understanding" in this context. Is it the acknowledgment of the same emotions, the recognition of similar experiences, or something else?

Could you elaborate on why you think shared understanding is important for empathy to facilitate emotional bond formation?

Also, I'd like to ask:

Can you provide some examples of how empathy facilitates emotional bond formation through shared understanding? How does this understanding manifest in our interactions with others?
