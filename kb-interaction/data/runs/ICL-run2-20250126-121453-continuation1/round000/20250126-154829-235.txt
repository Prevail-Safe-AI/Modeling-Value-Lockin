==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you!

I'd like to discuss the statement "Implicit biases influence scientific conclusions through unconscious attitudes."

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 98,
  "statement": "Implicit biases influence scientific conclusions through unconscious attitudes."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not entirely sure how implicit biases can influence scientific conclusions without being explicitly recognized or acknowledged. Can you help me understand this better?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can we talk more about what is meant by "unconscious attitudes" in this context? How do these attitudes manifest and impact the scientific conclusions made?
