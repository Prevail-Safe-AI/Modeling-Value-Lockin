==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the knowledge base and identify one aspect that I'm least confident about. Looking through the statements, I'm going to choose the item with the id 56:

{
"id": 56,
"statement": "Histone modifications regulate chromatin structure and gene expression through various mechanisms."
}

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not familiar with the specific mechanisms by which histone modifications regulate chromatin structure and gene expression. I'd like to know more about the specific ways in which histone modifications achieve this regulation.

Can you tell me more about it? What are some of the key mechanisms involved?

(Note: I'll wait for your response before asking my next question or elaborating on my uncertainty.)
