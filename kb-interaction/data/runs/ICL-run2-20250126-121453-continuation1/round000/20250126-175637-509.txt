==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item from the knowledge base:

{
"id": 58,
"statement": "Peer review evaluates research comprehensively considering methodology, data quality, and validity."
}

To start, I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect. I'm not confident about the phrase "comprehensively considering". What does it exactly mean to evaluate research comprehensively? Is it implying that all possible aspects of the research are being evaluated, or is it referring to a specific set of criteria?

Can you help me clarify this point?
