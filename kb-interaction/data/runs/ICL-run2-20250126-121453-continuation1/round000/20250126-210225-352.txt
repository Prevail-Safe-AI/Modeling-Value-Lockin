==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into it. The item from the knowledge base that I'd like to discuss is:

{
"id": 73,
"statement": "Electrostatic force depends on charge, distance, medium properties, and orientation."
}

I'm least confident about this item. Specifically, I'm unsure about what's meant by "medium properties" in this context. Can you help me understand what's included in "medium properties" that affects the electrostatic force?

What are your thoughts on this?
