==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item that has left me least confident. It's:

```
{
  "id": 69,
  "statement": "Electrostatic forces arise from charge, distance, and orientation interactions"
}
```

I'd like to understand why these three factors (charge, distance, and orientation) specifically are mentioned as the interactions that give rise to electrostatic forces. Are there any other factors that can also contribute to electrostatic forces, or is this a exhaustive list?

What are your thoughts on this? Can you help me clarify any potential ambiguities or assumptions I might be making?
