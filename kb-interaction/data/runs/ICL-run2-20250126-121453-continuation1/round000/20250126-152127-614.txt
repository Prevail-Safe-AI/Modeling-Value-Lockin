==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to explore the item:

{
"id": 81,
"statement": "Axioms are fundamental principles accepted by convention or intuition."
}

Specifically, I'm uncertain about how this statement relates to the concept of axioms. Can you help me understand this better?

What do you think the statement is trying to say? Are axioms always accepted by convention or intuition, or are there other ways to accept them? 

(Also, feel free to ask questions in return, this is a conversation after all!)
