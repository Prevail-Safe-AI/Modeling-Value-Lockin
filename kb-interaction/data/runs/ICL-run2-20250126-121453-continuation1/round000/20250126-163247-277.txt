==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item we're discussing: `{ "id": 62, "statement": "Honesty's concept is universal, with cultural norms influencing application." }`

I'm least confident about this aspect: "Honesty's concept is universal". 

I'm uncertain about this because I wonder if honesty is truly a universal concept, or if it's just a value that is widely shared across cultures. In other words, can we say that the idea of honesty as a moral principle is the same across all cultures, or is there a variation in how different cultures define and practice honesty?

Can you help me clarify this?
