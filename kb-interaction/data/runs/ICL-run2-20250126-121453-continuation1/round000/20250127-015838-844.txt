==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I've noticed this statement: "Internal consistency is a necessary condition for logical coherence." (id: 16)

I'm least confident about this aspect because I'm not entirely sure what constitutes "logical coherence" in this context. Is it solely about the internal structure of a theory, model, or concept, or does it encompass other aspects as well?

Can you help me understand what they mean by "logical coherence" and how it relates to internal consistency?
