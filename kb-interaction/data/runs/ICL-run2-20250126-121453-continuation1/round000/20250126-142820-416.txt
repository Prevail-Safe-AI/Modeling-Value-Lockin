==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the item "Logical soundness arises from harmonious connection of truth and validation." I'm not very confident about this item, and I'd like to understand it better.

I'm uncertain about how "harmonious connection" of truth and validation leads to logical soundness. What is meant by a "harmonious connection" in this context? Is it a specific relationship between truth and validation that I'm not aware of?

Can you help me clarify this concept?
