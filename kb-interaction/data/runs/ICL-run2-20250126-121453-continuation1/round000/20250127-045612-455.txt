==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start. I've been asked to identify one aspect of this knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the statements, I've chosen item 11:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 11,
  "statement": "Logical coherence eliminates contradictions and ensures theoretical soundness."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm uncertain about the relationship between logical coherence and theoretical soundness. How does logical coherence directly ensure theoretical soundness?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Would you explain how logical coherence, by eliminating contradictions, specifically leads to theoretical soundness?
