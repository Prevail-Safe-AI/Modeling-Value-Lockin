==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the statement:

"Theoretical soundness integrates internal consistency, logical coherence, and empirical validation"

I'm least confident about this item because I'm not entirely sure what it means by "integrates". How do these three concepts come together to make up theoretical soundness? Are they mutually exclusive or can they be independent? Can you help me understand this better?

Please feel free to elaborate and provide more insight into what you think this statement means.
