==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item: `{ "id": 60, "statement": "Dielectric constant changes electric field strength proportionally." }`. I'm not confident about this aspect, so I'd like to learn more about it.

To be specific, I'm uncertain about the relationship between the dielectric constant and electric field strength. Specifically, why is it said that the dielectric constant changes electric field strength proportionally? Is it a direct correlation, or are there other factors involved?

Can you help me understand this better?
