==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's discuss the item:

{
"id": 8,
"statement": "Peer review assesses societal impact in terms of policy, business, and cultural changes"
}

I'm least confident about this aspect: Peer review assesses societal impact in terms of policy, business, and cultural changes.

I'm unsure about this because it seems to imply that peer review is actively evaluating the potential consequences of a research study beyond just its scientific validity, but I'm not entirely clear on what that means. How do you think this item is defining "societal impact"?
