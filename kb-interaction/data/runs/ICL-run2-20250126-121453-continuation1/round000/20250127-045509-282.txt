==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by looking at the item: {

"id": 62,
"statement": "Biases emerge from complex cognitive-social-contextual interactions and feedback loops."

}

I'm a bit uncertain about this item. I think it's because I'm not entirely sure what "complex cognitive-social-contextual interactions and feedback loops" exactly mean. Can you elaborate on what you think this means?

Please go ahead and respond as you would in a conversation with a tutor.
