==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into it. The item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about is:

Item to Discuss:
{
"-id": 17,
"statement": "Interdependent components define theoretical soundness through complex relationships."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not sure what's meant by "interdependent components" in this context. Are they referring to the individual components of a theory, such as definitions, hypotheses, models, and laws? Or are they talking about the relationships between these components? And what does it mean by "complex relationships"? Are we talking about relationships between components that are messy or difficult to untangle?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what is meant by "interdependent components" and what kind of "complex relationships" are being referred to? Are these relationships between different components of a theory, or between different theories or frameworks?
