==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the given knowledge base. I'd like to discuss item 91:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 91,
"statement": "Dielectric constant, polarization, conductivity impact electrostatic forces collectively."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm least confident about how the three components (dielectric constant, polarization, and conductivity) interact with each other to impact electrostatic forces. It seems to suggest a collective impact, but I'd like to better understand the relationship between these components.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you explain what kind of collective impact these components have on electrostatic forces? Is it a synergistic effect, where the combination of all three produces a more significant impact than if any one of them acted alone? Or do they simply add up to produce a cumulative effect?
