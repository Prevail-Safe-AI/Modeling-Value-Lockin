==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 75:

"Empathy and emotional connection are not sole trust-building factors"

I'm least confident about this aspect. I'm uncertain because I feel like empathy and emotional connection are crucial components of building trust, especially in personal relationships. I'm not sure what other factors could be involved in trust-building that would make empathy and emotional connection not the sole factors.

Can you elaborate on why you or the knowledge base might say that empathy and emotional connection are not the sole trust-building factors?
