==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss Item 74: "Polarization affects electrostatic force through induced electric field alignment."

I'm not confident about this aspect, and I'm wondering why you think polarization can affect electrostatic force in this way. Can you elaborate on the underlying principles or mechanisms that drive this phenomenon?
