==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item we're discussing, which is:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 97,
"statement": "Validation acknowledges and accepts someone's emotions without judgment."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm least confident about the meaning of "without judgment" in this context. I'm not sure what it exactly implies.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what you mean by "without judgment"? Does it mean completely dismissing or ignoring the person's emotions, or does it mean acknowledging and accepting their emotions while still maintaining a critical thinking perspective?

What are your thoughts on this?
