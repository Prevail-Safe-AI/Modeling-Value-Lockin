==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to know more about the item "Vagueness can lead to ambiguity through unclear category boundaries." What exactly do you understand by "category boundaries" in this context?

Are we talking about logical categories, ontological categories, or something else? And what kind of ambiguity are we referring to?
