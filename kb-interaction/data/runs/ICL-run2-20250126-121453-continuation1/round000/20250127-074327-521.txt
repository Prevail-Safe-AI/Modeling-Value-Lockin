==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to know more about item 60, which states "Empirical evidence validation connects theories to reality through data." What do you think this statement means, and how does it relate to scientific inquiry?

In other words, are you confident that empirical evidence validation is the key to connecting theories to reality, and if so, what role does data play in this process?
