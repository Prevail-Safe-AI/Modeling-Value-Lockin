==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm going to start by saying that I'm least confident about the item:

{
"id": 27,
"statement": "Electrostatic force depends on charge, distance, and polarization angle combinedly."
}

I'm not sure if I fully understand what "polarization angle" refers to in this context. Can you help me clarify what that means and how it relates to electrostatic force?
