==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into it. I'd like to discuss the item: 

{
"id": 14,
"statement": "Cultural norms influence scientific evidence interpretation through biases and assumptions."
}

I'm least confident about this aspect. I'm unsure about how cultural norms specifically influence scientific evidence interpretation. 

Can you elaborate on why you think cultural norms influence scientific evidence interpretation through biases and assumptions?

(I'll wait for your response before asking my specific clarifying questions)
