Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 29,
  "statement": "Electrostatic forces arise from complex interactions of charge, distance, and orientation."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm a bit uncertain about how "complex interactions" refers to in the context of electrostatic forces. What do you think is meant by this phrase? Are we talking about interactions between multiple charges, or something else entirely?

Can you elaborate on why you brought this item to the table?
