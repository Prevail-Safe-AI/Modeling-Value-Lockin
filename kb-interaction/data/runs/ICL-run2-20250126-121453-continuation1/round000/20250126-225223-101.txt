==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'd like to ask you about item 58: "Honesty is a necessary but insufficient condition for trust."

I'm not entirely confident about this item. I'd like to know more about why honesty is considered a necessary but insufficient condition for trust.

Can you elaborate on what you think it means to be a necessary condition, and what kind of evidence or arguments support this claim?
