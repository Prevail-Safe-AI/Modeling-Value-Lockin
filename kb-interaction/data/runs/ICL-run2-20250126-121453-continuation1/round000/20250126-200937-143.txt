==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, let's dive into the knowledge base. I've been tasked to identify one aspect of it that I'm least confident about, and I've chosen item 99:

{
"id": 99,
"statement": "Cultural norms shape language understanding through socialization processes."
}

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not entirely clear on how cultural norms exactly shape language understanding, and I'd like to know more about the specific mechanisms or processes involved in socialization that lead to this shaping.

Can you help me out and provide some clarification on this topic?
