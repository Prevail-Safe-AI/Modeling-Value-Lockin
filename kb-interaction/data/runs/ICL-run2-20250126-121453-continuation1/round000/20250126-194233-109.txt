==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm going to identify the item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about, and then we can discuss it together.

The item is:

{
"id": 69,
"statement": "Simplified Coulomb's Law formula assumes point-like and stationary charges"
}

I'm unsure about this item because I'm not familiar with Coulomb's Law or its assumptions. I don't know what "point-like" and "stationary" mean in this context. Can you explain it to me?
