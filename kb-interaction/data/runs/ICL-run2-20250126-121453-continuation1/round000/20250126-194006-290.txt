==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the item from the knowledge base:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 7,
  "statement": "Electrostatic force depends on medium, geometry, and surface properties."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm least confident about the relationship between these three factors: medium, geometry, and surface properties. I'm not sure how they interact with each other to affect the electrostatic force.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain how these three factors influence each other and the electrostatic force? For example, do they have relative weights or do they amplify each other in some way?

Please share your thoughts!
