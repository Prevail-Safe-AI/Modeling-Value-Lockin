==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item from knowledge base:

{
"id": 44,
"statement": "Electrostatic force depends on charge, distance, orientation, and medium."
}

I'm going to identify one aspect of this item that I'm least confident about: 

The statement seems to imply that electrostatic force is determined by four variables: charge, distance, orientation, and medium. I'm not sure why the medium is included as a factor, and how it affects the electrostatic force. Can you help me understand the relationship between electrostatic force and the medium?

Uncertainty A: How does the medium affect the electrostatic force?

Specific Clarifying Question: Can you give an example of how the medium (like air, water, or metal) influences the electrostatic force between two charged objects?
