==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the first item. I'd like to discuss the item with ID 19:

{
"id": 19,
"statement": "Logical coherence ensures internal consistency through formal principles alone."
}

I'm least confident about this item. I'm not entirely sure how "Logical coherence" and "formal principles" relate to each other, and how that combination ensures "internal consistency". Can you tell me more about what you understand by "Logical coherence" in this context?
