==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the statement: "Electrostatic force strength varies with dielectric constant of medium." I'm going to choose this item because I'm not entirely sure how electrostatic force is affected by the dielectric constant of a medium. Can you elaborate on why this is the case and what it means for the electrostatic force?
