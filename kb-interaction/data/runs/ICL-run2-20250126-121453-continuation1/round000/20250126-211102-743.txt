==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's take a look at the item:

{
"id": 1,
"statement": "Lying can sometimes be morally justifiable in certain contexts."
}

I'm a bit uncertain about this item, and I'd like to discuss it with you.

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

* I'm not confident about the idea that lying can ever be morally justifiable, even in certain contexts. I've always been taught that honesty is the best policy, and that lies can cause harm to others.

Specific Clarifying Questions:

* Can you give me some examples of situations where lying might be morally justified?
* How do you define "morally justified" in this context? Is it based on the consequences of the lie, the intentions behind it, or something else?

What are your thoughts on this item, and how do you think we should approach this topic?
