==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thanks for being eager to chat.

So, let's dive into the knowledge base. I've selected an item that caught my attention: `{ "id": 86, "statement": "Logical coherence ensures necessary conditions for consistency and accuracy" }`.

I'm least confident about this item. I'm not sure how to elaborate on the concept of "necessary conditions" in the context of logical coherence. Can you help me understand this better?

What do you think "necessary conditions" means in this statement? Is it referring to specific criteria, principles, or something else entirely?
