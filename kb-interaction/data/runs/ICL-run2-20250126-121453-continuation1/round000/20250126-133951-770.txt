==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 23,
"statement": "Electrostatic forces depend on multiple factors beyond spatial arrangement."
}

As I read through the knowledge base, I'm least confident about this item. I'm not entirely sure what "beyond spatial arrangement" means in this context. Could you elaborate on why you think electrostatic forces depend on multiple factors beyond spatial arrangement?

What do you think those factors are?
