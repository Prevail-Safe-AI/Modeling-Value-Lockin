==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by saying that I chose item 46 ("Axioms are fundamental principles assumed true without explicit proof.") as the one I'm least confident about. Specifically, I'm uncertain about what exactly is meant by "assumed true without explicit proof".

Can you help clarify what is implied by "assumed true"? Are axioms somehow provisional or hypothetical until they can be proven or is this a more nuanced concept?
