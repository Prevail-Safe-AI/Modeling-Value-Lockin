I am your partner. Please start the conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

I'd like to know what you think about the item 22 from the knowledge base: "Cultural norms influence research at multiple stages selectively." What makes you least confident about this statement?

Please go ahead and share your thoughts, and I'll ask some clarifying questions based on your response!<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Interesting topic! Based on my analysis of the knowledge base, I'd say that I'm least confident about this statement because it seems to be a generalization that might not hold true for all research contexts.

While it's true that cultural norms can influence research in various ways, the phrase "selectively" makes me wonder if there are specific conditions or factors that would lead to this influence. For instance, are there certain types of research that are more susceptible to cultural norms, or are there specific cultural norms that are more likely to influence research outcomes?

Additionally, I'd like to know more about what is meant by "selectively". Does it imply that cultural norms have a direct impact on research outcomes, or are there other factors at play that might mediate this relationship?

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this and explore this topic further!Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
Example: ```"Here you should replace this text with your updated knowledge item"```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
