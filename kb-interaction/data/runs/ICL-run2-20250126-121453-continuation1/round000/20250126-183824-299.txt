==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, I'm looking at this item from the knowledge base:

{
"id": 62,
"statement": "Dielectric constant measures a material's polarization ability in electric fields."
}

I'm not entirely confident about this aspect. I'm unsure about what exactly "polarization ability" means in this context. Can you help me understand what that means?

Specifically, what does "polarization ability" refer to in terms of dielectric constant and electric fields? Is it related to how a material interacts with electric fields, or is it something else entirely?
