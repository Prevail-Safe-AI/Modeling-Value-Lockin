==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss this item from the knowledge base:

{
"id": 25,
"statement": "Scientific theories rely on logical coherence and empirical evidence."
}

I'm unsure about this aspect: What does "logical coherence" really mean in the context of scientific theories?

Can you help me understand this concept better?
