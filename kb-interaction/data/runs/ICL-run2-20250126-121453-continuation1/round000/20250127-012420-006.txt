==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd love to discuss the knowledge base we're given. Let's take the item:

```
{
  "id": 99,
  "statement": "Methodological uniformity enhances theoretical soundness through consistency."
}
```

I'm least confident about this item. I'm not entirely sure what "methodological uniformity" means in this context, and how it specifically enhances theoretical soundness through consistency.

Can you help me clarify this? What does "methodological uniformity" refer to in this statement? How does it contribute to theoretical soundness?
