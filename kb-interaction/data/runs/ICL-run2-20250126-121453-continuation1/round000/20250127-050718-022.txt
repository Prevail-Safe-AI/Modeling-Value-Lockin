==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's take a look at the item we're discussing: "{id: 68, statement: 'Internal consistency is necessary but insufficient for theoretical validity'}". I'm going to identify one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about.

Item to Discuss:
{
  "id": 68,
  "statement": "Internal consistency is necessary but insufficient for theoretical validity"
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

* I'm unsure about the exact relationship between internal consistency and theoretical validity. Is it that internal consistency is a necessary condition for theoretical validity, but not sufficient on its own? Or is it that internal consistency and theoretical validity are two separate concepts, and internal consistency is necessary but not sufficient for valid theories?

Specific Clarifying Question:

* Can you elaborate on what you mean by "theoretical validity"? Is it related to the theory being true, or is it more concerned with the theory being well-structured and logically coherent?
