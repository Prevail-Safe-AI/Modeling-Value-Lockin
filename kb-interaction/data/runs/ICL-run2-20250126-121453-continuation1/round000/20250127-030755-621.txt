==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 22:

{
"id": 22,
"statement": "Domain experts' biases can compromise research validity significantly through conscious and unconscious factors."
}

I'm least confident about this aspect. I'm unsure about the extent to which domain experts' biases can compromise research validity.

Can you elaborate on why you think domain experts' biases can compromise research validity, and what you mean by "conscious and unconscious factors"?
