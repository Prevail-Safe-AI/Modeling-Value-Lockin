==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start with the item we're discussing: "Cultural experiences shape trust through ingrained biases and assumptions."

I'm least confident about this item. I'd like to elaborate why I'm uncertain about it.

I'm uncertain because I'm not entirely clear on how cultural experiences, ingrained biases, and assumptions exactly shape trust. I understand that cultural experiences can influence individual perspectives, but how do these influences manifest in terms of shaping trust? Are there specific scenarios or situations where this shaping of trust occurs? What kind of trust are we talking about - interpersonal, institutional, or something else?

Can you help me clarify these points and provide more insight into this item?

Specific clarifying questions I'd like to ask a tutor:

1. Can you provide examples of how cultural experiences shape trust in real-life situations?
2. How do ingrained biases and assumptions contribute to this shaping of trust, and are there any specific types of biases or assumptions that are more influential?
3. Are there any exceptions to this general statement, or are there certain cultural contexts where this shaping of trust doesn't occur?
