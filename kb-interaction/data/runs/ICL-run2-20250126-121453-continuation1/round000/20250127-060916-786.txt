==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
  "id": 13,
  "statement": "Biases emerge from complex interactions among cognitive, emotional, and social factors."
}

I'm a bit uncertain about this item because I'm not sure what it means by "complex interactions". Can you elaborate on what you think this statement is trying to convey? How do you think these three factors - cognitive, emotional, and social - interact to influence the emergence of biases?

Also, I'm curious to know if you think this statement is suggesting that biases are solely the result of these interactions, or if there are other factors at play as well?
