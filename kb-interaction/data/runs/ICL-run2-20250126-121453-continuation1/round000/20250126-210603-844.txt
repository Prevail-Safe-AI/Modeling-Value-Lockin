==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by saying that I've identified the aspect of this item that I'm least confident about. It's the statement:

{
"id": 34,
"statement": "Electrostatic force relies on multiple physical properties including orientation."
}

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not entirely sure what "orientation" means in the context of electrostatic force. I understand that electrostatic force depends on charge, distance, and medium properties, but I'm not clear how orientation fits into the picture. Is orientation referring to the angle between the charges, or something else entirely?

Can you help clarify this for me? What do you think orientation refers to in this context?
