==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by saying that I'm having trouble grasping the relationship between logical coherence and empirical evidence in the statement "Logical coherence ensures internal consistency but requires empirical evidence." Can you help me understand what the author means by this?

Specifically, I'm wondering if the author is suggesting that logical coherence is only meaningful or valuable if it's supported by empirical evidence. Or is it the other way around, that empirical evidence is only trustworthy or credible if it's coherent with logical rules and principles?

What are your thoughts on this?
