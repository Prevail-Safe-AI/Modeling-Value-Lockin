==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. The item is:

```
{
  "id": 39,
  "statement": "Axioms in science are nuanced assumptions with underlying evidence"
}
```

I'm uncertain about the phrase "nuanced assumptions". What does it mean to have "nuanced" assumptions in science? Are there any specific examples of axioms that qualify as "nuanced assumptions"?
