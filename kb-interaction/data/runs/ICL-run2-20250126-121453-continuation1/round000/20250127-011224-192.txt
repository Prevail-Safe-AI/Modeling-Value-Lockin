==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into it!

I've been looking at the knowledge base, and I'm actually least confident about the statement:

{
  "id": 11,
  "statement": "Internal biases, emotions, and experiences significantly impact trust development."
}

Can you elaborate on what you think this statement means? How do internal biases, emotions, and experiences influence trust development, and why do you think it's significant?

I'm curious to hear your thoughts!
