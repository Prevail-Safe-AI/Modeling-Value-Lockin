==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 58,
"statement": "Emergent properties arise from shared context, environment, and interactions"
}

I'm least confident about this item because I'm not entirely sure what it means by "shared context" in the context of emergent properties. 

Could you explain to me what they mean by "shared context"?
