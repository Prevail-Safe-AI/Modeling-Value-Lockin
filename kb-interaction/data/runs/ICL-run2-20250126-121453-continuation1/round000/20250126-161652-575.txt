==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 82 from the knowledge base. The statement says "Cultural norms shape scientific interpretation through collective beliefs and values." I'm least confident about this item, and I'd like to explore it further.

To start, can you elaborate on why you think cultural norms shape scientific interpretation? What specific beliefs and values are you referring to, and how do they influence scientific interpretation?
