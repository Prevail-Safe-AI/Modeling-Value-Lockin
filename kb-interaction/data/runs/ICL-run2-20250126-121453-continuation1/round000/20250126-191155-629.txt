==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'd like to know more about the item:

{
"id": 14,
"statement": "Electrostatic force determined by charges, distance, and orientation primarily."
}

I'm least confident about this aspect: I'm not sure why the item states that the electrostatic force is determined by charges, distance, and orientation primarily. Can you elaborate on what you think this means? Are there any specific situations or conditions where the electrostatic force is primarily determined by these factors?

What do you think?
