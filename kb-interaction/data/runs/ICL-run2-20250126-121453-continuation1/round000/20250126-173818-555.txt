==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the item we're discussing. It's statement 88: "Honesty's meaning and value depend on social context and values." I'm not very confident about this aspect, and I'd like to know more.

I'm unsure because I haven't thought much about how social context and values influence the concept of honesty. How do you think social context affects the meaning and value of honesty? For example, is it true that in some cultures or societies, honesty is more valued or prioritized than in others?

Can you help me clarify this aspect and feel more confident about it?
