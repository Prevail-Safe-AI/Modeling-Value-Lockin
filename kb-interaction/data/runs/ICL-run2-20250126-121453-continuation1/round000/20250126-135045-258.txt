==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's focus on item 30 from the knowledge base. It states that "Electrostatic forces depend on charge distribution, proximity, and orientation." I'm not highly confident about this aspect, so I'd like to discuss it further.

Can you elaborate on what you mean by "charge distribution"? Is it the uneven arrangement of electric charges, or something else?
