==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's get started.

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 95,
  "statement": "Dielectric constant measures polarization, not electric charge directly."
}
```

I'd like to explore this statement further. I am least confident about... "Dielectric constant measures polarization, not electric charge directly."

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

* What is the exact relationship between dielectric constant and electric charge? Is it that dielectric constant measures the effect of electric charge on the material's properties?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on how dielectric constant measures polarization, and what is the connection between polarization and electric charge?

Please respond with your thoughts!
