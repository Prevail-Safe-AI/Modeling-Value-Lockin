==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's take a look at item 63 from the knowledge base:

{
"id": 63,
"statement": "Honesty is a necessary but insufficient condition for trust."
}

I'm unsure about this statement. Specifically, I'm wondering what the author means by "insufficient condition". Could you elaborate on why honesty alone is not enough to build trust?
