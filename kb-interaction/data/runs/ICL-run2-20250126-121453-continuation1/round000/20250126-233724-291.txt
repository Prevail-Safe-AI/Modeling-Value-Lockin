==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the task. I'm asked to identify one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the item, I've identified:

Item to Discuss:
{
  "id": 78,
  "statement": "Theory components interact and influence each other unevenly."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm unsure about the extent to which theory components can interact and influence each other unevenly. I'm not sure what exactly is meant by "unevenly" in this context. Is it possible for theory components to have an uneven or disproportionate impact on each other, or does evenly imply a more balanced or symmetrical interaction?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you elaborate on what is meant by "unevenly" in this statement and provide some examples of how theory components can interact and influence each other unevenly?
