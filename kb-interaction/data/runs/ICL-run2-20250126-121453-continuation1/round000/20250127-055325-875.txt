==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the specific item: `{ "id": 98, "statement": "Internal consistency guarantee absence of contradictions within scope only" }`. I'm least confident about this aspect.

Uncertainty A: I'm unsure about what the term "scope" refers to in this context. Is it referring to the specific topic or domain being discussed, or is it something else entirely?

Uncertainty B: I'm also unclear about what exactly is being guaranteed - is it that internal consistency will always prevent contradictions within a certain scope, or is it that internal consistency is sufficient but not necessary to guarantee the absence of contradictions within a scope?

Specific Clarifying Question: Can you help me understand what "scope" means in this context, and provide an example of a situation where internal consistency may not guarantee the absence of contradictions within a scope?
