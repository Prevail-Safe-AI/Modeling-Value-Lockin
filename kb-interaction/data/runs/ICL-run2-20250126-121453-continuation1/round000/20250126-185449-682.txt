==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, I'd like to discuss the item at "id": 22, which states that "Cultural and social norms influence peer review indirectly through implicit biases." I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect of peer reviewing. 

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
The idea that cultural and social norms can influence peer review indirectly through implicit biases feels a bit fuzzy to me. I'm not sure how implicit biases work and how they can be influenced by cultural and social norms.
Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain more about how cultural and social norms influence peer review indirectly through implicit biases? For example, how do these biases manifest in the peer reviewing process, and what are some potential consequences of these biases?
