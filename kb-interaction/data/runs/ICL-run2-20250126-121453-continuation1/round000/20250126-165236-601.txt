==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm happy to help clarify!

I'm uncertain about the statement "Static cling in clothes occurs due to surrounding electrical charge" because it seems to oversimplify the complex phenomenon of static cling. While it's true that electrical charges can play a role in static cling, the statement doesn't fully capture the underlying mechanisms.

Static cling is a common issue where fabrics cling to each other or to the body due to the buildup of static electricity. However, the surrounding electrical charge is just one aspect of the equation. The actual cause of static cling is often a combination of factors, including:

1. Friction: When fabrics rub against each other or against the body, they can generate static electricity. This is because the friction creates a separation of electrical charges between the fabrics, leading to a buildup of static electricity.
2. Materials: The type of fabric used can also contribute to static cling. Synthetic fabrics like polyester and nylon are more prone to static cling than natural fibers like cotton and wool.
3. Humidity: Dry air can exacerbate static cling, as it allows the electrical charges to build up more easily.
4. Clothing design: The design of the clothing itself can also play a role. For example, tight-fitting clothing or clothing with synthetic fabrics can increase the likelihood of static cling.

In summary, while surrounding electrical charge is one factor that can contribute to static cling, it's not the sole cause. The actual cause is often a complex interplay of factors, including friction, materials, humidity, and clothing design.
