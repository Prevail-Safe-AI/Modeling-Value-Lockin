==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by discussing item 38:

Item to Discuss:
{
  "id": 38,
  "statement": "Cognitive, social, and contextual factors interact to shape biases."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm a bit uncertain about how these three factors interact to shape biases. I'm not confident that I fully understand the process.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you help me understand what's meant by "interact" in this statement? Do the cognitive, social, and contextual factors work together in some way, or do they influence each other independently?
