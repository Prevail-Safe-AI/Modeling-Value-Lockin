==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start. I noticed the item:

{
"id": 67,
"statement": "Cognitive biases in experts can lead to data analysis errors."
}

I'm not entirely confident about this aspect. I'm wondering, what specific examples or types of cognitive biases may lead to these data analysis errors? Are there certain biases that are more common or easier to identify in experts?

What are your thoughts on this?
