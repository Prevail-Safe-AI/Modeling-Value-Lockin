==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start with the given item from the knowledge base:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 29,
  "statement": "Spatial arrangement defines 3D position of electric charges distribution."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
Its statement seems straightforward, but I'm uncertain about how "spatial arrangement" specifically defines the 3D position of electric charges distribution. I'd like more clarity on what that means.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you provide an example or an explanation of how spatial arrangement, in this context, uniquely defines the 3D position of electric charges distribution? For instance, how does it differentiate from other factors that might influence electric charges, like charge density or orientation?

What are your thoughts on this?
