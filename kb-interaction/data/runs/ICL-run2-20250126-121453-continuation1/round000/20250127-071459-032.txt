Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Excited to dive in!

Okay, so I'm looking at item #83:

{
  "id": 83,
  "statement": "External validity guarantees generalizability to contexts with shared variables generally"
}

I'm least confident about the part where it says "generally". What makes you think that external validity only guarantees generalizability to contexts with shared variables, and not to all contexts? Or am I misunderstanding the statement entirely?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You're diving right in!

You're correct to be cautious about the "generally" part. The statement is saying that external validity guarantees generalizability to contexts with shared variables, but not necessarily to all contexts.

The idea is that external validity is about whether the findings of a study can be applied to other settings, populations, or situations. However, the statement is specifying that this generalizability is limited to contexts that share certain variables or characteristics with the original study. In other words, if the study was conducted in a specific country, with a specific population, using a specific methodology, then the external validity would only guarantee generalizability to other contexts that share those same characteristics.

The "generally" part is acknowledging that there might be other contexts that don't share those same variables, and therefore, the findings might not be applicable. It's not saying that external validity guarantees generalizability to all contexts, just that it's limited to contexts with shared variables.

Does that clarify things?Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
