==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. The item is:

{
"id": 33,
"statement": "Assumptions' interdependencies create complex logical systems and consequences."
}

I'm uncertain about how the interdependencies between assumptions create complex logical systems and consequences.

Could you help me understand this better?
