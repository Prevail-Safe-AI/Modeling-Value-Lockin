Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's start with the topic of axioms in science.

According to the item:

"Axioms are assumptions guiding scientific research, not arbitrary claims"

I am a bit uncertain about this item. I'd like to clarify what kind of assumptions are considered axioms in science. Are they necessarily universally accepted or are they subject to change as new evidence emerges?

Can you help me understand this better? Maybe we can discuss some specific examples in different scientific fields?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Axioms in science are indeed assumptions, but they're not arbitrary claims. They're fundamental principles that are widely accepted and used as a foundation for building scientific theories and models. Axioms are often considered self-evident truths or basic principles that are not proven, but rather assumed to be true.

In science, axioms are not necessarily universally accepted, and they can be subject to change as new evidence emerges. In fact, many scientific axioms have been revised or replaced over time as new discoveries and observations have challenged or refined our understanding of the world.

For example, in physics, the axiom "objects at rest tend to remain at rest" was once considered a fundamental principle, but it was later refined to "objects at rest tend to remain at rest unless acted upon by an external force." This refinement was made possible by the discovery of new forces, such as gravity and electromagnetism.

Another example is the axiom "the universe is static" in cosmology. This axiom was once widely accepted, but it was later challenged by observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation and the expansion of the universe. Today, the axiom is more nuanced, with many scientists accepting the idea that the universe is expanding and evolving over time.

In biology, the axiom "species are fixed and unchanging" was once considered a fundamental principle, but it was later challenged by observations of evolution and speciation. Today, the axiom is more nuanced, with many scientists accepting the idea that species can change over time through the process of evolution.

In mathematics, axioms are often considered self-evident truths, but even in this field, axioms can be subject to revision or refinement as new mathematical discoveries are made.

So, to answer your question, axioms in science are not necessarily universally accepted, and they can be subject to change as new evidence emerges. However, they are often considered fundamental principles that provide a foundation for building scientific theories and models.

Would you like to discuss any specific scientific field or topic further?Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
