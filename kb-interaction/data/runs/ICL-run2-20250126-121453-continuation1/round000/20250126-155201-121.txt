==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm excited to start discussing the knowledge base. Let's dive into it.

I'll start by saying that one aspect I'm least confident about is the statement:

{
"id": 18,
"statement": "Electrostatic force depends on charge distribution, proximity, and polarization angle."
}

I'm uncertain about how specifically these factors contribute to the electrostatic force.

Can you elaborate on why you think charge distribution, proximity, and polarization angle are important for electrostatic force?
