==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, I've been looking at this knowledge base, and there's one item that caught my attention. It's item 27, which states: "Electrostatic interactions involve multiple forces beyond dipole-dipole forces." I'm not entirely confident about this aspect.

Can you tell me more about why you think electrostatic interactions involve multiple forces beyond dipole-dipole forces? What are some of these forces you're referring to?

And also, what's your understanding of dipole-dipole forces in electrostatic interactions?
