==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. I've chosen item #10: "Electrostatic force depends on charge, distance, orientation, and medium."

Things I'm Uncertain About This Item:

I'm not entirely sure what it means by "orientation". Is it referring to the angle between the charges or something else? And what kind of medium is it talking about? Is it just any medium, or is it specific to certain types of materials?

Specific Clarifying Question:

Can you explain what is meant by "orientation" in this context, and provide an example of how it would affect the electrostatic force?
