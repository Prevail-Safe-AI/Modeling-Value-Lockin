==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item #45 from the knowledge base: "Moral development involves multiple influences, individual differences, and complexities."

I'm not entirely confident about this aspect. What I'm uncertain about is how the multiple influences affect individual moral development. Are these influences additive, or do they interact with each other in more complex ways?

Can you elaborate on why you think this is the case?

And, more specifically, could you clarify whether biology, as one of the influences, plays a more significant role in shaping individual moral development compared to other factors?

Please share your thoughts!
