==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into item 35: "Cultural norms influence research priorities and agendas through values, prioritization, methods, and funding."

I'm least confident about this item because I'm not entirely sure how cultural norms influence research priorities and agendas. It seems like a complex relationship. Can you elaborate on why you think cultural norms would affect research priorities and agendas through values, prioritization, methods, and funding?

What are some specific examples or scenarios that might demonstrate this connection between cultural norms and research priorities?
