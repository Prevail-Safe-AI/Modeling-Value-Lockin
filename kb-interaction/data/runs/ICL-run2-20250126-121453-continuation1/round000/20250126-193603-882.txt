==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about: "Item to Discuss: { \"id\": 97, \"statement\": \"Logical coherence and consistency are necessary but insufficient conditions.\" }".

What I'm uncertain about is why logical coherence and consistency are considered necessary but insufficient conditions. Could you help me understand this better? For example, are there any specific scenarios or cases where logical coherence and consistency aren't enough to guarantee the truth or validity of a theory or scientific claim?
