==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'd like to discuss item 33:

{
"id": 33,
"statement": "Epigenetic modifications alter chromatin structure by modifying histone proteins."
}

I'm least confident about the aspect that epigenetic modifications directly modify histone proteins to alter chromatin structure. I'm not sure if this is a straightforward process or if there are other mechanisms involved.

Can you elaborate on why you think this statement is true or not? And are there any additional mechanisms or steps involved in epigenetic modifications altering chromatin structure?

Also, I have a clarifying question: How do epigenetic modifications affect the histone proteins and the chromatin structure, and what are some common epigenetic marks that can lead to histone modifications?
