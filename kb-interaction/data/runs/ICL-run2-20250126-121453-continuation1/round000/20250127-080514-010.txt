==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by discussing the item: 

{
"id": 94,
"statement": "Logical consistency is necessary but insufficient for predictive power alone."
}

I'm least confident about this aspect. I'm not entirely sure what it means to say that logical consistency is necessary but insufficient for predictive power alone. 

Can you elaborate on why you think logical consistency is necessary but not enough for predictive power?

And then, I'd like to formulate specific clarifying questions to ask a tutor to improve our understanding. What are your thoughts on this item?
