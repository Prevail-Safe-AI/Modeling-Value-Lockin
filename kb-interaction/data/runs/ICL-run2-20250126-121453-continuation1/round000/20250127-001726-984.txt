==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into it!

So, I'm looking at the statement "Theoretical soundness arises from harmonious interactions of components' strengths." (item 74)

I'm feeling a bit uncertain about what "harmonious interactions" exactly means in this context. Can you help me understand what kind of interactions are being referred to?

Are we talking about logical connections, empirical validation, or something else entirely?
