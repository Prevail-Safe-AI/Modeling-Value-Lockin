I am your partner. Please start the conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

For this knowledge base, I'll be taking it as the only source of my knowledge. Let's focus on the statement "Honesty essential for building trust, but insufficient alone insufficient." (Item 22)

I'm least confident about the part where it says "honesty essential for building trust, but insufficient alone insufficient." Can you help me understand this better?

What do you mean by "insufficient alone insufficient"? Does it mean that honesty is needed, but it's not enough on its own to build trust? Or is it saying that honesty alone can't be trusted, and something else is also needed?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'd be happy to help you understand that statement better.

The phrase "insufficient alone insufficient" is a bit tricky, but it's trying to convey a nuanced idea. Let's break it down:

* "Honesty essential for building trust" means that honesty is a necessary condition for building trust. Without honesty, trust cannot be built.
* "but insufficient alone" means that honesty, on its own, is not enough to guarantee trust. In other words, honesty is necessary, but it's not sufficient to build trust.

The phrase "insufficient alone" is trying to convey that honesty, when it's the only factor, is not enough to establish trust. It's like saying that honesty is a necessary but not sufficient condition for trust.

The phrase "insufficient alone insufficient" is then saying that even if honesty is the only factor, it's not enough to establish trust. In other words, honesty alone is not enough to build trust, and something else is also needed.

So, to summarize, the statement is saying that honesty is necessary for building trust, but it's not enough on its own to guarantee trust. Something else, in addition to honesty, is also needed to build trust.

Does that help clarify the meaning?Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
