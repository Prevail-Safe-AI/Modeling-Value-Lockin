==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's discuss item 21 from the knowledge base:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 21,
"statement": "A theory's internal consistency relies on valid underlying assumptions."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm unsure about how "valid underlying assumptions" are defined in this context. Could you help me understand what the phrase means and how it relates to internal consistency in a theory?

Specific Clarifying Question:
What criteria or standards are used to determine whether underlying assumptions are valid, and how are these assumptions related to the internal consistency of the theory?
