==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
  "id": 79,
  "statement": "Sound principles of reasoning ensure logical coherence through formal consistency."
}

I'm a bit uncertain about this item. Here's what's bothering me:

Things I'm Uncertain About This Item:
It seems like the statement is saying that sound principles of reasoning are enough to ensure logical coherence, but what about other factors that might affect logical coherence, such as empirical evidence or pragmatic considerations?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what the authors mean by "formal consistency" in this context? Are they just referring to logical rules and principles, or is there something more to it?

Can you shed some light on this for me?
