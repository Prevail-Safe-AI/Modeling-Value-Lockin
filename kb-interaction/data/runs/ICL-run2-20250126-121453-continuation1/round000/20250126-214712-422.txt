==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item. I've highlighted one aspect I'm least confident about, which is:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 96,
  "statement": "Cultural norms shape emotional responses through social learning and conditioning."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

* I'm not entirely sure about the relationship between cultural norms, social learning, and conditioning in shaping emotional responses. Specifically, I'm wondering if cultural norms can directly influence emotional responses without going through the process of social learning and conditioning.

Can you elaborate on this relationship and help me understand it better?
