==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's focus on the item "Internal validity affects external validity through construct validity". I'm not very confident about this item because I'm not entirely clear on how internal and external validity are related.

Can you help me understand why internal validity affects external validity through construct validity? What are the implications of this statement? What are the assumptions behind it?
