==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 15 from the knowledge base:

{
"statement": "Rigorous research reduces errors but does not eliminate them."
}

I'm having a hard time understanding why "rigorous research" doesn't completely eliminate errors. Can you help me clarify this?
