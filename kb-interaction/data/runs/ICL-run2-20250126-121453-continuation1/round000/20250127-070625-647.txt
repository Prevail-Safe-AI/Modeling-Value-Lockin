==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item:

Item to Discuss:
{
  "id": 67,
  "statement": "Cognitive biases arise from complex social emotional experiences."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

I'm not confident about how "complex social emotional experiences" contribute to the development of cognitive biases. Can you elaborate why you think cognitive biases arise from these experiences?

Specifically, what mechanisms do you think are at play in this process? Is it something related to emotions influencing our thoughts, social interactions shaping our perceptions, or something else entirely?
