==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start.

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 77,
  "statement": "Electrostatic forces depend on charge, distance, orientation, and surrounding medium."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
One aspect I'm not entirely confident about is the relation between the variables mentioned. I'm not sure how all these factors (charge, distance, orientation, and surrounding medium) contribute to electrostatic forces. I'm also unclear about the relative importance of each factor.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you please elaborate on how each of these factors affects electrostatic forces? For example, how does the surrounding medium impact the force, and in what ways do the charge, distance, and orientation interact with each other?
