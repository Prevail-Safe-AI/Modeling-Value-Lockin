==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 94,
"statement": "Clear definitions establish a logical structure for coherent ideas."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I am least confident about understanding how clear definitions can directly lead to a logical structure for coherent ideas. I'm not sure what specific mechanisms or relationships are at play here.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you elaborate on what you mean by "logical structure" in this context? Is it referring to the organization and relationships between concepts, or is it more related to the soundness or validity of the ideas themselves?
