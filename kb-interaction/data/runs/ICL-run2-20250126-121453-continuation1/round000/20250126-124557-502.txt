==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 85,
"statement": "Epigenetic modifications alter chromatin structure to regulate gene expression."
}

I'm least confident about this aspect:

I'm not entirely sure how epigenetic modifications actually alter the chromatin structure to regulate gene expression. Can you elaborate on what's happening at the molecular level?

Specific clarifying question:
What specific mechanisms do epigenetic modifications employ to alter chromatin structure, and how do these changes ultimately impact gene expression?

What are your thoughts on this?
