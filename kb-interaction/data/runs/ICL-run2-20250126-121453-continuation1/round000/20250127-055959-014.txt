==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the item:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 36,
"statement": "Uncertainty refers to various forms of unpredictability and ambiguity."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm least confident about the clarity of the definition and how uncertainty is categorized into different forms. The statement seems to mention that uncertainty refers to both unpredictability and ambiguity, but it's not clear how these two concepts are related or if there are other forms of uncertainty.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you elaborate on what you mean by "various forms of unpredictability" and "ambiguity" in this context? Are these mutually exclusive or can they co-exist in certain situations?
