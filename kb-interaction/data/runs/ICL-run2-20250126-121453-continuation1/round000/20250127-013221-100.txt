==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the statement. I've chosen item 73 from the knowledge base, which is:

"Cultural context influences trust development through diverse experiences."

I'm curious about this statement because I'm not entirely clear on what it means by "diverse experiences". Can you help me understand what kind of experiences are being referred to here? For example, are we talking about personal experiences, societal experiences, or something else entirely?

Also, how does the cultural context influence trust development in this scenario? Is it a one-way street, or are there multiple factors at play?
