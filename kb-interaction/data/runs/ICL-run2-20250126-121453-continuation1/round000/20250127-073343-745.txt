==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item: {
  "id": 63,
  "statement": "Logical soundness requires internal consistency and empirical evidence"
}

I'm least confident about this item. I'm unsure about how these two concepts, internal consistency and empirical evidence, are related to logical soundness.

Could you help me clarify why internal consistency and empirical evidence are important for logical soundness? Are they the only factors that contribute to logical soundness, or are there other aspects as well?

This lack of understanding is blocking my confidence in this item, and I'd love to get a better grasp on it.
