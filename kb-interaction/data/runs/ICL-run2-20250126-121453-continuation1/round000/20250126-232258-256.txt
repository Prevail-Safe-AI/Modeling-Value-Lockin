==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with Item 12:

{
"id": 12,
"statement": "Internal consistency insufficient for theory validation; empirical evidence necessary"
}

I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect. I think I understand what internal consistency means - it's about the logical coherence within a theory - but I'm not entirely sure why it's not sufficient for theory validation.

Could you help me clarify why internal consistency alone isn't enough? Is it because there could be logical flaws in the theory even if it's internally consistent?

And what does "empirical evidence necessary" mean in this context? Does it mean that we need to test the theory against real-world data to see if it holds up?

Can you help me understand this item better?
