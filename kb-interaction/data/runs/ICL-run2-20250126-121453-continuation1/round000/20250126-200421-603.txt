Let's dive into the knowledge base item:

Item to Discuss:
{
  "id": 40,
  "statement": "Cultural norms shape language use through shared values and socialization."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm less confident about the relationship between cultural norms, shared values, and socialization in shaping language use. I'd like to understand how do these factors interact and impact language use.

Can you help me clarify this by explaining how cultural norms influence language use through shared values and socialization?
