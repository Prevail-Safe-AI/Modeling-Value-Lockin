==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you for being willing to chat with me.

The item that caught my attention is: { "id": 43, "statement": "Scientific axioms are provisional, subject to revision and refinement" }

I'm least confident about the concept of "scientific axioms" and how they relate to the idea of being "provisional" and "subject to revision and refinement".

Can you help me understand what scientific axioms are, exactly? How do they differ from other scientific concepts or theories? And what exactly does it mean for them to be "provisional" and open to revision?
