==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

Item to Discuss:
{
  "id": 98,
  "statement": "Theoretical soundness encompasses internal consistency, accuracy, and practical relevance."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm unsure about how accuracy is related to theoretical soundness. 

Specific Clarifying Question:
How does accuracy contribute to the theoretical soundness of a concept or theory? Is it a necessary condition, or can a sound theory be accurate but lacking in accuracy?
