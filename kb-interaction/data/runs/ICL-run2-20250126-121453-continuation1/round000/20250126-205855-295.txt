==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base.

So, I've been asked to identify one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. And the item is:

{
"id": 6,
"statement": "Logical coherence is necessary but insufficient for scientific credibility."
}

I'm not entirely sure about what "insufficient" means in this context. Could you help me understand why logical coherence is necessary but not sufficient for scientific credibility?

For example, what other factors are necessary for scientific credibility besides logical coherence? Are there any specific situations or cases where logical coherence might not be enough to establish scientific credibility?
