==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, I've been looking at this knowledge base, and I noticed an item that caught my attention. It's item 21:

{
"id": 21,
"statement": "Logical soundness requires harmonious balance among truth, validity, and consistency."
}

I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect, and I'd like to get a better understanding. Can you help me clarify what the author means by "harmonious balance" here? What specific relationships are being referred to between truth, validity, and consistency?

Also, how does this relate to logical soundness in general? Is this balance a necessary or sufficient condition for logical soundness?

Can you shed some light on this?
