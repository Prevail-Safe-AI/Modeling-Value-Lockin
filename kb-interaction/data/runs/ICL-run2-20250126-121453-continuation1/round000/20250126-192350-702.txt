==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item "Electrostatic force depends on charge, distance, orientation, and polarity." 

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 10,
  "statement": "Electrostatic force depends on charge, distance, orientation, and polarity."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm unclear about how these factors interact with each other. Specifically, I'm not sure how the charge, distance, orientation, and polarity of the electric charges affect the electrostatic force.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you provide more information on how each of these factors influences the electrostatic force, and whether there are any particular combinations or scenarios where one or more of these factors have a greater impact than others?
