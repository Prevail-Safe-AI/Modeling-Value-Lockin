==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by asking you about the item I'm least confident about. It's:

{
"id": 96,
"statement": "Electric field interacts with medium properties: permittivity, conductivity, and dielectric constant."
}

I'm a bit uncertain about the interaction between electric fields and medium properties. Could you help me elaborate on why I'm unsure?

Also, as we discuss this, I'll be taking notes on the clarifying questions I'd like to ask a tutor to improve my understanding.
