==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you! I'll start by identifying the item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about.

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 13,
  "statement": "Peer review assesses research comprehensively, ensuring integrity and credibility."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not entirely sure how peer review ensures the integrity and credibility of research. I understand that peer review is a process where experts evaluate research, but I'd like to know more about the specific mechanisms and criteria that ensure integrity and credibility.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain to me how peer review specifically addresses issues of integrity and credibility in research, and what kind of criteria experts use to assess these aspects?

Now it's your turn!
