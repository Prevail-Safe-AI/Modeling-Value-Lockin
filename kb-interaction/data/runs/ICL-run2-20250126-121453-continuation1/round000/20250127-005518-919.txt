==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into it.

So, the item is:

{
"id": 66,
"statement": "Contextual factors, both internal and external, influence data interpretation."
}

I'm interested in understanding what you think about this item. I'm least confident about the aspect of "internal and external contextual factors".

Can you elaborate on what you think are the internal and external contextual factors that influence data interpretation?

Are they related to the researcher, the data, or both? How do these factors impact the interpretation of data?
