==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item I've selected: ```

{
"id": 66,
"statement": "Logical coherence ensures reliable predictions through consistent assumptions and evidence."
}

```

I am least confident about the connection between logical coherence and reliable predictions. Can you elaborate on why you think logical coherence would lead to reliable predictions? What do you think about the phrase "consistent assumptions and evidence"? How do they relate to each other in the context of this statement?

Please share your thoughts, and I'll be happy to hear your perspective!
