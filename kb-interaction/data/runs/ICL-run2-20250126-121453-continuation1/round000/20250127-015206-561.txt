==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you! Let's begin with the item from the knowledge base that I'd like to discuss. Item 11 states: "Honesty's morality adapts to context and morally relevant circumstances."

I'm least confident about this item because I'm not sure what it means by "morally relevant circumstances." Can you help me understand what types of circumstances are considered morally relevant?
