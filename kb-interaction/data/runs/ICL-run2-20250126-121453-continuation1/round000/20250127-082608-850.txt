==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the item I'd like to discuss.

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 60,
"statement": "Logical consistency affected by contextual, linguistic, and practical factors"
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item: 

I'm uncertain about how these three types of factors - contextual, linguistic, and practical - impact logical consistency.

Specific Clarifying Question: 

Can you elaborate on how these factors, individually or collectively, can affect logical consistency, and provide examples to illustrate the concept?
