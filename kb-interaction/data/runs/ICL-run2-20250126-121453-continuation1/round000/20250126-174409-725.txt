==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base! I'd like to discuss the item:

```
{
  "id": 9,
  "statement": "Peer review evaluates research for scientific validity, significance, impact, and effectiveness."
}
```

I'm least confident about the aspect "effectiveness". I'm not entirely sure what effectiveness refers to in this context. Is it the practical implementation of the research findings, or is it something else?

Can you help me understand what they mean by "effectiveness" in relation to peer review?
