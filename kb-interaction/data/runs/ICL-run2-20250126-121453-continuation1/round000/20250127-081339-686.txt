==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the knowledge base item:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 35,
  "statement": "A theory's generalizability refers to its applicability across populations."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not entirely sure what is meant by "populations" in this context. Are they specific groups of people, or is it referring to a broader sense of scope or scale?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what kind of populations the theory's generalizability is intended to generalize to, and how this concept relates to other concepts like universality or scope?
