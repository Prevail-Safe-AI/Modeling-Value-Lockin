==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's discuss the item:

`{ "id": 37, "statement": "Electrostatic force depends on charge, distance, orientation, and medium properties." }`

I'm least confident about this item. I'm unsure about the aspect that mentions "orientation". What exactly does "orientation" refer to in the context of electrostatic force? Is it the angle between the electric field lines and the charge, or something else?

Can you help clarify this for me?
