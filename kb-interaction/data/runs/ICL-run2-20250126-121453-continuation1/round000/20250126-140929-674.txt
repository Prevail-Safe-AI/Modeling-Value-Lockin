==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been tasked with analyzing one aspect of the knowledge base I was given, and I've chosen item 88:

{
"id": 88,
"statement": "Coulomb's Law is modified by medium and charge distribution."
}

I'm least confident about this aspect because I'm not entirely sure what "medium" refers to in this context. Is it a specific type of material, or is it more general? Could you help me clarify this?

Also, how does "charge distribution" impact the modification of Coulomb's Law? Is it a factor in the magnitude of the force, or does it affect the direction of the force in some way?

Can you provide some insight or suggest any resources that might help me better understand this concept?

Thanks!
