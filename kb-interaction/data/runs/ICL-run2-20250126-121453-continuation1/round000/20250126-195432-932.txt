==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by discussing the statement "Electrostatic force depends on medium properties, affecting force strength." (Item 82)

I'm least confident about this aspect because I'm not entirely sure what specific medium properties affect the electrostatic force strength. Is it only the dielectric constant and conductivity, as mentioned in item 93?

Can you help me understand this better?
