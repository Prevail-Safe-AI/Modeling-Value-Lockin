==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item from the knowledge base: `{ "id": 54, "statement": "Polarization is molecular alignment in electric fields." }`. My task is to identify one aspect of this item I'm least confident about, and then elaborate why I'm uncertain about it.

After reviewing the item, I'm a bit uncertain about the phrase "molecular alignment in electric fields". Can you help me understand what's going on here? For example, what do you mean by "molecular alignment"? Are you referring to a specific type of alignment, such as dipolar alignment? And what kind of electric fields are we talking about? Are they static or dynamic?

I'm also curious to know if there's a more in-depth explanation or a diagram that could help me better grasp this concept.
