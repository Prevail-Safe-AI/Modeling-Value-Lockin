==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I've been asked to identify an aspect I'm least confident about, and mine is the item:

{
  "id": 97,
  "statement": "Axioms serve as foundations for specific scientific theoretical frameworks."
}

I'm uncertain about the relationship between axioms and scientific theoretical frameworks. What do you think this statement means, and how do axioms contribute to the development of scientific theories?

Please help me clarify my understanding!
