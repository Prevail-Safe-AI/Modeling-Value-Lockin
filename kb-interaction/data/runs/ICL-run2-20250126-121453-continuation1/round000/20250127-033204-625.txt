==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's focus on the first item:

"The statement "Internal consistency ensures logical coherence and predictive power""

I'm least confident about the relationship between internal consistency and logical coherence. Can you explain why you think internal consistency leads to logical coherence? What mechanisms or processes do you think are involved?

Also, what do you think happens to the predictive power of a theory or model when there is internal consistency but not logical coherence?
