==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's take a look at this item:

{
"id": 84,
"statement": "Electrostatic force depends on charge distribution, proximity, and orientation."
}

I'm least confident about this aspect of the item. I'm not sure if I fully understand what it means by "charge distribution". Can you help me clarify what that refers to?

For instance, does it mean the distribution of charge on a specific object, or the distribution of charges between two objects? Or is there something else I'm missing?

What are your thoughts on this?
