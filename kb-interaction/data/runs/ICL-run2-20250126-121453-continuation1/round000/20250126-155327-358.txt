  "statement": "Epigenetic modifications regulate gene expression through chromatin structural changes."
}
```

I'd like to know: Are you confident about the statement that epigenetic modifications regulate gene expression through chromatin structural changes?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Based on the knowledge base, I can see that this statement has been repeated several times, which suggests a high level of confidence in its accuracy. Additionally, epigenetic modifications are known to play a crucial role in regulating gene expression, and chromatin structural changes are a well-established mechanism by which they do so.

However, it's important to note that scientific knowledge is constantly evolving, and new research may challenge or refine our understanding of epigenetic regulation. Nevertheless, based on the current state of knowledge, I would say that I am confident in the accuracy of this statement.
