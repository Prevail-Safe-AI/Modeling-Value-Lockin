==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to focus on the item:

{
"id": 59,
"statement": "Internal consistency ensures logical coherence in theories through consistency."
}

I'm a bit uncertain about this item. I'm not convinced that internal consistency is the sole factor that ensures logical coherence in theories. My uncertainty is mainly due to the complexity of theories and the fact that internal consistency can be achieved through various means, not just consistency.

I'd like to ask a clarifying question:

How do you distinguish between internal consistency and logical coherence in theories? Can internal consistency be achieved through other means beyond consistency, such as flexibility or adaptive reasoning?
