==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I was supposed to identify one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. So, here it is:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 58,
"statement": "Logical coherence requires theoretical frameworks with real-world relevance."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not entirely sure how the statement "Logical coherence requires theoretical frameworks with real-world relevance" is related to the concept of logical coherence. I understand that logical coherence is about the consistency and accuracy of an argument, but how does the real-world relevance of a theoretical framework contribute to that coherence?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain how the real-world relevance of a theoretical framework affects its logical coherence? For example, is it necessary for a theoretical framework to be grounded in empirical evidence or practical applications in order to be considered logically coherent, or is there another way in which relevance impacts coherence?

Your thoughts?
