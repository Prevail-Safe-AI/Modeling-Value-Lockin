==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item from the knowledge base:

```
{
  "id": 70,
  "statement": "Logical coherence requires internal consistency and well-organized components."
}
```

Specifically, I'd like to identify one aspect of this item that I'm least confident about. After examining the item, I think I'm least confident about the phrase "well-organized components". I'm unsure what exactly it means by "well-organized components" in the context of logical coherence.

Can you help me understand what this phrase is trying to convey? Are "well-organized components" referring to specific components of a theory, such as assumptions, definitions, or explanations? Or is it referring to some sort of organizational structure or framework that contributes to logical coherence?

What do you think?
