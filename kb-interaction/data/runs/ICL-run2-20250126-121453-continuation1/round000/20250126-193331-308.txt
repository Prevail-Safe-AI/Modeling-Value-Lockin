==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying one aspect of the item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about.

The item that I've chosen is:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 81,
  "statement": "Logical coherence ensures scientific theory's internal consistency and trustworthiness."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
* I'm not entirely sure how to distinguish between internal consistency and trustworthiness in the context of scientific theories.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand how logical coherence ensures both internal consistency and trustworthiness in scientific theories, and how these two concepts relate to each other?

What are your thoughts on this?
