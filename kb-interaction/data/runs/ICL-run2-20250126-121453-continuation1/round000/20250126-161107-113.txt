==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start. The item from the knowledge base I'd like to discuss is:

{
"id": 16,
"statement": "Epigenetic modifications involve histone methylation and DNA methylation"
}

I'm least confident about this aspect: I'm not entirely sure what histone methylation and DNA methylation are, and how they relate to epigenetic modifications. Could you help clarify this for me?

Can you elaborate on why you're uncertain about that aspect?
