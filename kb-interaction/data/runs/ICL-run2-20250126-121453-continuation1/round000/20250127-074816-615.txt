==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 7,
"statement": "Underlying assumptions determine theory's validity and practical relevance in context."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

Hmm... I'm not entirely confident about the part where it says "underlying assumptions determine theory's validity and practical relevance in context". I'm wondering, are these underlying assumptions always explicitly stated in the theory? Or can they be implicit or even unconscious biases?

Could you help me understand this better?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what kind of underlying assumptions are meant by this statement? Are they always explicitly stated in the theory, or can they be implicit or even unconscious biases?
