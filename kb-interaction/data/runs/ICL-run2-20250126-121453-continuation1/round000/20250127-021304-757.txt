==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss Item 11:

"Theoretical soundness emerges from harmonious integration of logic, evidence, and validation."

I'm least confident about this aspect because I'm not entirely sure what is meant by "harmonious integration" in this context. What does it mean for logic, evidence, and validation to be harmoniously integrated, and how does that lead to theoretical soundness?

Can you help me understand this better?
