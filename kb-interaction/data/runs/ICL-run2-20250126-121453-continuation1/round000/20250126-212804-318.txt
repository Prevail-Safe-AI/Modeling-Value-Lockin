==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying one aspect of the knowledge base item that I'm least confident about. The item is:

{
"id": 45,
"statement": "Historical events shape cultural norms through shared social experiences."
}

I'm uncertain about this item because I'm not entirely clear what is meant by "shared social experiences". Can you elaborate what is meant by this phrase? How do historical events shape cultural norms through shared social experiences?

Specifically, I'd like to ask: 

"What does 'shared social experiences' refer to in this context? Is it a specific type of event, such as wars, economic downturns, or major societal changes? Or is it more general, such as everyday interactions and cultural practices?"
