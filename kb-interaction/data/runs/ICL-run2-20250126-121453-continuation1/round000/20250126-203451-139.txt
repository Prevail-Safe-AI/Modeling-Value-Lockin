==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item we're discussing:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 61,
"statement": "Internal consistency in theories requires logical coherence and evidence."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

(Honestly, I'm not entirely confident about the idea that internal consistency in theories solely requires logical coherence and evidence. I'm not sure what implications this has for scientific theories that may not be perfectly logical or where the evidence is incomplete or uncertain.)

Specific Clarifying Question:

(Could you explain what you mean by "internal consistency" in this context? Is it referring to the consistency of a theory within itself, or the consistency of the theory with other theories or empirical evidence?)
