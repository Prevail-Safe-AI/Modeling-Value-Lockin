==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by discussing the item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. It's the item with ID 29:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 29,
"statement": "Electrostatic force depends on charge, distance, and orientation primarily."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not sure why electrostatic force is referred to as "primarily" dependent on charge, distance, and orientation. What might be some additional factors that contribute to electrostatic force, and why is it specified that these three factors are primary?

Specific Clarifying Question:
What are some examples of situations where electrostatic force would be dependent on factors other than charge, distance, and orientation, and how do these additional factors affect the force?
