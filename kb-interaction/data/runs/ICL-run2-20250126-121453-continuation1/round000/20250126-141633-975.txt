==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you!

I'll go ahead and choose one of the items from the knowledge base, which is:

```
{
  "id": 60,
  "statement": "Histone modifications regulate chromatin structure through chromatin remodeling."
}
```

I'll be honest, I'm a bit uncertain about this item. I'm not very confident about how histones modify chromatin structure and vice versa.

So, what I'm unsure about is the exact mechanism of how histone modifications regulate chromatin structure through chromatin remodeling. Can you help me clarify this?

Specifically, I have a few questions:

* What are histone modifications exactly, and how do they affect the chromatin structure?
* What is chromatin remodeling, and how does it relate to histone modifications?
* Can you provide examples of specific histone modifications and how they lead to changes in chromatin structure?

Please help me understand this concept better!
