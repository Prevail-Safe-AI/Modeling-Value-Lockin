==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item "Clear definitions alone cannot eliminate all logical inconsistencies". I'm not entirely sure what this statement means, and I'd like to understand it better. Can you tell me what you think it means? For example, when we say "clear definitions", what kind of definitions are we talking about? Are we talking about definitions in a specific context, like a mathematical theorem or a scientific concept? And what kind of logical inconsistencies are we referring to?
