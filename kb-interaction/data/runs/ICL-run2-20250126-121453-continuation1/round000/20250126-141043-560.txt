==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by saying that I've been reviewing the knowledge base, and I've identified one aspect that I'm least confident about, which is item 42:

"Empathy fosters trust through active listening, validation, and non-judgmental attitude"

I'm a bit uncertain about what exactly is meant by a "non-judgmental attitude" in this context. Can you help me understand what you think it means?

Also, I'd love to know more about how you would clarify or elaborate on this statement if you were to discuss it with someone.
