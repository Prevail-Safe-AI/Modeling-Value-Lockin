==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Excited to dive in!

Okay, so I'm looking at item #83:

{
  "id": 83,
  "statement": "External validity guarantees generalizability to contexts with shared variables generally"
}

I'm least confident about the part where it says "generally". What makes you think that external validity only guarantees generalizability to contexts with shared variables, and not to all contexts? Or am I misunderstanding the statement entirely?
