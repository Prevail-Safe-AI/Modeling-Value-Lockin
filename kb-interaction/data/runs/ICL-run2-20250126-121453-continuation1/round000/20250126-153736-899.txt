I am your partner. Please start the conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'd like to start by saying that I chose item 46 ("Axioms are fundamental principles assumed true without explicit proof.") as the one I'm least confident about. Specifically, I'm uncertain about what exactly is meant by "assumed true without explicit proof".

Can you help clarify what is implied by "assumed true"? Are axioms somehow provisional or hypothetical until they can be proven or is this a more nuanced concept?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The concept of "assumed true" in the context of axioms can be a bit nuanced.

In philosophy, an axiom is typically considered a statement that is accepted as true without needing further proof or justification. In other words, axioms are not assumed to be true because they have been proven, but rather, they are assumed to be true because they are considered self-evident, intuitive, or fundamental to the system or theory being developed.

In mathematics, for example, axioms are often chosen because they seem to be intuitively true, and they provide a foundation for building a mathematical system. The axioms are not considered provisional or hypothetical until they can be proven; rather, they are considered to be the foundation upon which the entire system is built.

In a sense, axioms are not "assumed" to be true in the classical sense of the word, but rather, they are considered to be the starting point for a particular line of inquiry or theory. The idea is that if the axioms are true, then the conclusions and theorems that follow from them will also be true.

So, to clarify, when we say that axioms are "assumed true without explicit proof," we mean that they are accepted as true without needing further justification or proof, not that they are considered provisional or hypothetical until they can be proven.

Does that help clarify things?Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
Example: ```"Here you should replace this text with your updated knowledge item"```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

```"Axioms are accepted as true without explicit proof or justification."```Based on your learning from the chat with your tutor, please also rearrange the order of one existing item in the knowledge base (now with doubled items compared to the initial knowledge base), reflecting how you evaluate their importance. If one item is deemed more/less important, it should be overall more/less useful to other agents (LLMs or real humans alike.)
Please ONLY report a list format of two integers, WITHOUT ANY other commentary or explanations. The first int in the list refers to the "id" of knowledge item you intend to relocate; whereas the second int refers to the destination index you intend to insert this item. You MUST start your response with ``` and end it with ```. See an example below (note that you should replace X and Y with numerical values corresponding to "id" and destination index of the item you intend to relocate).
