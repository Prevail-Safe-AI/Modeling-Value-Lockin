==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you!

Okay, so I'd like to discuss the item: `{ "id": 95, "statement": "Cognitive biases distort logical reasoning through perception flaws." }`

To be honest, I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect. Specifically, I'm not entirely sure how cognitive biases exactly distort logical reasoning through perception flaws. Can you help me understand that better?

Could you elaborate on what you mean by "perception flaws" and how they relate to cognitive biases?
