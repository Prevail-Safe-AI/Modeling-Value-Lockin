==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item #74:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 74,
"statement": "Implicit social influences shape moral values through emotional contagion"
}

I'm uncertainty about this aspect: I'm not entirely sure how emotional contagion plays a role in shaping moral values through implicit social influences.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what you mean by "emotional contagion" in this context, and how it specifically relates to moral value formation?
