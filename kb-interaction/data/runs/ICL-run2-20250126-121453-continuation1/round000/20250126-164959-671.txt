==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item: 

{
"id": 34,
"statement": "Accurate information relies on verification and critical evaluation."
}

I'm feeling somewhat uncertain about this item. I think it's because I'm not entirely sure what "critical evaluation" means in this context. Is it just a synonym for "checking the facts" or is there more to it? 

Can you help me understand this better?
