==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by discussing the item:

{
"id": 74,
"statement": "Empirical evidence validation bridges theory and reality through data."
}

I'm least confident about the phrase "bridges theory and reality". What do we mean by "bridges"? Is it like a connection, a link, or something else? Are we saying that empirical evidence validation brings together the theoretical framework and the real-world observations, or does it create a new entity that combines them in some way?

What are your thoughts on this?
