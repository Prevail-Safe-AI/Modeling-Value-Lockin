==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item I'm least confident about, which is:

```
{
  "id": 99,
  "statement": "Quantum effects negligible at macroscopic electrostatic scales."
}
```

I'm unsure about this aspect because I want to know more about what's meant by "macroscopic electrostatic scales". What is the definition of that, and how do we know that quantum effects are indeed negligible at those scales? Are there any specific conditions or limitations that apply to this statement?

Can you help me clarify this?
