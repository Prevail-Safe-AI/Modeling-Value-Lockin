==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
  "id": 82,
  "statement": "Learned moral values shape honesty perceptions through cultural, religious, and social influences."
}

I'm least confident about this item, and I'd like to understand it better. My uncertainty is mostly about how these factors (cultural, religious, and social influences) specifically shape honesty perceptions. For example, are there any specific ways in which cultural values can either promote or undermine honesty?

Can you help clarify this for me?
