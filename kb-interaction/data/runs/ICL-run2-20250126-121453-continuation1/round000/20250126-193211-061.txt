==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the knowledge base statement: "Cultural norms shape moral principles through complex socialization processes."

Specifically, I'm uncertain about the relationship between cultural norms and moral principles. I've noticed that the statement implies a direct influence of cultural norms on moral principles, but I'm not sure how this works.

Can you elaborate on what you understand by "complex socialization processes"? How do cultural norms shape moral principles through these processes?

Also, are there any specific examples or scenarios where cultural norms have influenced moral principles in a significant way?
