==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into it. The item we're discussing is:

```
{
  "id": 16,
  "statement": "Internal coherence ensures logical consistency within a theory's components."
}
```

I'm least confident about the concept of "internal coherence". Can you elaborate what you think "internal coherence" means in this context?
