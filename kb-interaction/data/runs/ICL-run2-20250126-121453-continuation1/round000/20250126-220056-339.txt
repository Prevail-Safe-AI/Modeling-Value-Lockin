==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 55:

{
"id": 55,
"statement": "Honesty is foundation of trust, establishes consistency."
}

I'm least confident about the relationship between honesty and consistency. I'm not sure how honesty directly establishes consistency. Can you elaborate on that?
