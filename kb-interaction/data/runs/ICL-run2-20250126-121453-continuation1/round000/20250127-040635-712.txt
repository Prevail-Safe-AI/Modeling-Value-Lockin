==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 75,
"statement": "Conflict resolution ensures internal consistency in theoretical frameworks."
}

Things I'm Uncertain About This Item:

I'm not entirely sure what kind of conflicts are being referred to in this statement. Are they intellectual conflicts, where different theories or ideas are in disagreement? Or are they conflicts in the sense that different stakeholders have different interests or goals that need to be reconciled?

Specific Clarifying Question:

Can you help me understand what kind of conflicts are being referred to here, and how does resolving those conflicts lead to internal consistency in theoretical frameworks?
