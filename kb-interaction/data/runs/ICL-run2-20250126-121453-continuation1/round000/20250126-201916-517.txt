==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item #35 from the knowledge base: "Logical coherence is not sufficient for credibility alone."

I'm least confident about this aspect because I'm not entirely sure what it means. My understanding of logical coherence is that it refers to the consistency and internal consistency of a logical argument or theory. But what does "credibility" mean in this context? Is it saying that logical coherence is important, but not the only factor that determines the credibility of a theory or argument?

Can you help me understand what this statement is getting at?
