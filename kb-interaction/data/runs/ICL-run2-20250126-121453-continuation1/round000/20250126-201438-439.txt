==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I've chosen an item that caught my attention. It's Item #25:

{
"id": 25,
"statement": "Logical coherence is a necessary but insufficient condition for credibility."
}

I have to admit, I'm not entirely confident about this item. I'd like to understand more about why logical coherence is considered necessary but insufficient for credibility.

Could you help me clarify this point? For instance, what does "insufficient" mean in this context? Is there something else that's required beyond logical coherence to establish credibility?
