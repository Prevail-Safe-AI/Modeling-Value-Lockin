==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by identifying one aspect of the item that I'm least confident about, and then we can discuss it further.

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 72,
"statement": "Theoretical soundness involves harmonious balance of coherence, evidence, and testing."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm unsure about what "harmonious balance" specifically means in this context. It seems like a vague term, and I'm not entirely clear on how to operationalize it.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you provide an example of what a harmonious balance of coherence, evidence, and testing might look like in a specific theoretical context? For instance, how would this balance be achieved in a scientific theory, and what are some of the key indicators that would suggest the balance is being maintained?
