==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item "Meaning construction involves interconnected cognitive-emotional-cultural processes.". 

I'm least confident about the term "meaning construction". Can you explain what it means in this context, and how the cognitive-emotional-cultural processes are interconnected?

Please elaborate on that.
