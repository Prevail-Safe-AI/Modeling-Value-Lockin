==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive in.

I want to discuss Item 19 from the knowledge base:

"{ id: 19, statement: 'Logical coherence in theories refers to internal consistency and logical flow.' }"

I'm least confident about this aspect because I'm not entirely sure what "logical flow" means in this context. Is it referring to the sequence of arguments or premises in a theory, or is it something more abstract?

Can you help me understand what "logical flow" means here, and maybe provide some examples to illustrate the concept?

(Note: I'll start asking questions, and then you can respond. Then, I'll provide my thoughts and clarifying questions, and so on.)
