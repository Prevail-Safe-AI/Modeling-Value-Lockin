==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the item from the knowledge base: `{ "id": 94, "statement": "Internal coherence refers to logical consistency within theoretical frameworks." }`

I'm going to take a guess that I'm least confident about the meaning of "internal coherence" and how it relates to logical consistency within theoretical frameworks. I'd love to know more about what this statement is trying to convey.

Can you help me understand what "internal coherence" refers to in this context? Is it a specific aspect of theoretical frameworks, or is it a broader concept that applies to other areas as well?
