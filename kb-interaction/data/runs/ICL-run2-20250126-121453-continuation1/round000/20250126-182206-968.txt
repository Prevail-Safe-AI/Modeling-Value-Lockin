==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with Item 20: "Trust arises from cumulative interpersonal experiences and interactions". I'm a bit uncertain about this item. I'm wondering if it's entirely accurate to say that trust solely arises from cumulative experiences and interactions.

Can you help me understand more about what you think this item is trying to say? For example, what kind of experiences and interactions are we talking about here? Is it just limited to personal relationships, or can it extend to other forms of trust, like trusting institutions or systems?

Also, are there any potential limitations or nuances to this statement that I'm missing?
