==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by saying that I've been assigned to discuss this knowledge base item:

{
  "id": 40,
  "statement": "Cognitive biases emerge from the intersection of thinking, emotions, and context."
}

Specifically, I'm least confident about this aspect: the statement itself. I'm not entirely sure what "cognitive biases emerge from the intersection of thinking, emotions, and context" means or how it works.

Could you help me understand what you think this statement is trying to say? For example, what do you think "the intersection of thinking, emotions, and context" refers to, and how does that produce cognitive biases? Are there any specific examples or scenarios that illustrate this concept?

I'm curious to learn more about this item and improve my understanding.
