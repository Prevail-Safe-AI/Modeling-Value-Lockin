==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been tasked with discussing one aspect of the given knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the statements, I've chosen item #77:

{
"id": 77,
"statement": "Validating assumptions ensures a theory's empirical grounding and coherence."
}

I'm unsure about this item because I'm not entirely clear about what it means to "validate assumptions" in the context of theory development. Specifically, I'm wondering what kind of validation is being referred to and how it relates to empirical grounding and coherence.

Can you help clarify this concept for me? What does it mean to validate assumptions in this context?
