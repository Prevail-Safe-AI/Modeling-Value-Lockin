==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've chosen an item from the knowledge base to discuss. It's item 38:

{
"id": 38,
"statement": "Research validity relies on methodology, data quality, and internal validity."
}

I'm least confident about this aspect of the item. Specifically, I'm uncertain about the relationship between internal validity and research validity.

Can you help me understand what internal validity means in the context of research validity? How does it contribute to the overall validity of a study?

Let me know your thoughts, and I'll ask follow-up questions based on your response!
