==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 44,
"statement": "Electrostatic force depends on charge, distance, orientation, and medium properties."
}

What I'm least confident about is how the "orientation" factors in. Is it only related to the spatial arrangement of the charges or does it involve other aspects as well?

Can you help me understand this better?
