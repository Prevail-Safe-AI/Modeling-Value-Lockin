==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you! Okay, let's dive in!

I'd like to discuss this item from the knowledge base:

```
{
  "id": 98,
  "statement": "Accuracy depends on data quality, interpretation, and analytical methods."
}
```

I'm least confident about this aspect: "interpretation".

I'm not entirely sure what kind of interpretation is being referred to here. Is it the interpretation of the results, or is it the interpretation of the data itself? Maybe it's something else entirely? 

Could you help clarify what kind of interpretation is meant in this context?
