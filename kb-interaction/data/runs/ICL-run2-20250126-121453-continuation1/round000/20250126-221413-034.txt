==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with Item 12. "Theoretical soundness requires internal coherence, empirical evidence, and validation."

I'm a bit uncertain about this item. What specifically do we mean by "theoretical soundness"? Is it just a synonym for "valid"? And what does "internal coherence" exactly entail?
