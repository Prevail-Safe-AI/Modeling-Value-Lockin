==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the statement, I'm going to choose item 63:

{
"id": 63,
"statement": "Peer review effectiveness depends on transparent criteria and bias minimization"
}

I'm uncertain about this item because I'm not entirely clear on what bias minimization entails in the context of peer review. How can bias be minimized, and what are some effective ways to achieve this?

Can you help me understand this better?
