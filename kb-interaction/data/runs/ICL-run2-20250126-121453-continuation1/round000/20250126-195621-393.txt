I am your partner. Please start the conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 20,
"statement": "Logical coherence insufficient to provide social norms clarity alone"
}

What are you least confident about this item? Is there something that doesn't quite add up or makes you go "hmm"?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Interesting choice!

Upon reviewing the statement, I'm least confident about the phrase "social norms clarity". The term "clarity" seems somewhat ambiguous in this context. What does it mean for social norms to have "clarity"? Is it referring to the ease of understanding, the consistency, or the explicitness of the norms?

Without a clear definition or explanation, I'm left wondering what the author intends to convey. Are they suggesting that logical coherence alone is insufficient to provide a clear understanding of social norms, or are they implying that logical coherence is insufficient to provide a clear set of social norms?

I'd love to discuss this further and explore possible interpretations or clarifications!Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
Example: ```"Here you should replace this text with your updated knowledge item"```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
