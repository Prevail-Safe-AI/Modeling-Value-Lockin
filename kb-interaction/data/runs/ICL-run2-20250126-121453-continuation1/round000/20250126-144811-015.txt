==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive in.

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 33,
"statement": "Coulomb's Law describes inverse square law between charges"
}

I'm least confident about this item. I'm uncertain about the specific scope and applicability of Coulomb's Law.

Things I'm Uncertain About This Item:
* Does Coulomb's Law only describe the interaction between two point charges, or can it be applied to other situations as well?
* Are there any exceptions or limitations to the inverse square law described by Coulomb's Law?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you please explain how Coulomb's Law is used in situations where the charges are not point charges, such as when dealing with real-world objects that have finite sizes?
