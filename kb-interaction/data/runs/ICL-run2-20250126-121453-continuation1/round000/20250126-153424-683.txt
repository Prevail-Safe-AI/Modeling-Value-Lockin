==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the item:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 80,
"statement": "Systematic evaluation involves explicit consideration of evidence reliability."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

I'm not entirely confident about the term "explicit consideration". What does it mean to consider evidence reliability explicitly? How do we determine whether evidence is reliable? Can you help clarify this for me?

Specific Clarifying Question:
How do we ensure that we explicitly consider evidence reliability in a systematic evaluation? Are there specific steps or protocols we should follow?
