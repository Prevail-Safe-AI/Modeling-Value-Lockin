==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the item we're discussing: "Empathy arises from complex interplay of cognitive, emotional, and contextual factors." (Item 18)

However, I'm least confident about this aspect of the item. I'm unsure about the specific roles of cognitive, emotional, and contextual factors in the complex interplay that leads to empathy.

Can you clarify what you think each of these factors contributes to the development of empathy? How do you think they interact with each other to produce empathetic understanding?
