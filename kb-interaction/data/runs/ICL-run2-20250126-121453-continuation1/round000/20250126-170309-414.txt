Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Let's dive into this!

I'd like to know more about the aspect you're least confident about regarding the item "Newton's law of universal gravity underwent refinements in lesser-known ways" (ID 41).

Could you please identify one thing that makes you uncertain about this statement?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm happy to dive into this!

Upon reviewing the knowledge base, I noticed that there is no direct evidence or statement that explicitly mentions "Newton's law of universal gravity underwent refinements in lesser-known ways". The closest statement is "Law of universal gravitation has undergone significant theoretical refinements" (ID 8), but it doesn't specifically mention Newton's law.

This lack of direct evidence makes me uncertain about the accuracy of statement ID 41, as it seems to be an indirect or implied connection between the two statements. I'd love to clarify or confirm this information to increase my confidence in the statement!
