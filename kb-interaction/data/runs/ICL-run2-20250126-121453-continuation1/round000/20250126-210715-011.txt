==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item #39:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 39,
"statement": "Dielectric constant measures material's polarization response to electric fields."
}

Things I'm Uncertain About This Item:

I'm least confident about the relationship between the dielectric constant and polarization response to electric fields. I'm not entirely clear on how these two concepts are connected.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain why the dielectric constant is related to polarization response to electric fields? How do changes in dielectric constant affect the material's polarization behavior?

What are your thoughts on this?
