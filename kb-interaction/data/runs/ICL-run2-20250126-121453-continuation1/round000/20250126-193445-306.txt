==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, I'd like to discuss the item from the knowledge base:

{
"id": 78,
"statement": "Logical reasoning eliminates ambiguity through systematic evaluation of assumptions."
}

I am least confident about the aspect of how logical reasoning actually eliminates ambiguity. I'm not sure if it's because I don't fully understand the concept of systematic evaluation of assumptions or if I'm unclear about the relationship between logical reasoning and eliminating ambiguity.

Can you please elaborate on why you think logical reasoning eliminates ambiguity through systematic evaluation of assumptions?
