==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item: "Objectivity in rational justification remains an elusive goal in complex discussions." (id: 85)

I'm a bit uncertain about this item, and I'd like to know more about what it means. Specifically, I'm wondering: what do you think makes objectivity "elusive" in complex discussions? Is it the involvement of multiple perspectives, emotions, or something else entirely?

Can you help me understand the context behind this statement and why objectivity is considered an "elusive goal"?
