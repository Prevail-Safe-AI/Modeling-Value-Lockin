==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with Item 74: "Axioms in science are subject to revision and refinement." I'm least confident about this item.

I'm unsure about how axioms in science can be subject to revision and refinement. My understanding is that axioms are assumed to be true without proof or demonstration, so how can they be revised or refined? Are axioms always changing, or are there certain circumstances in which they can be changed?

Can you help me understand this better?
