==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the task. I'll choose item 16 from the knowledge base, which is:

{
"id": 16,
"statement": "Internal coherence ensures logical consistency within theoretical frameworks' components."
}

I'm least confident about this item. I'm uncertain about what is meant by "theoretical frameworks' components". Can you help me understand what is referred to by this term? Are we talking about sub-components of a theoretical framework, or something else entirely?
