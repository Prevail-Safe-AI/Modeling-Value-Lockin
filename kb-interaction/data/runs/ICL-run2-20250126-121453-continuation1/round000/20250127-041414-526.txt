==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by saying that I'm least confident about the item:

{
"id": 71,
"statement": "Clear definitions provide foundation for logical coherence framework"
}

I'm not entirely sure what is meant by "clear definitions" in this context. Is it just about defining the terms used in the framework, or is it about the internal consistency of the definitions themselves? In other words, are clear definitions necessary for logical coherence within the framework, or is it more about providing a foundation for others to build upon?

What are your thoughts on this item?
