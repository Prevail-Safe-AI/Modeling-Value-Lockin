==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I can analyze the statement based on the knowledge base provided.

The statement "Internal coherence ensures logical consistency within theory components" suggests that internal coherence is a necessary condition for logical consistency within a theory's components. In other words, if a theory's components are internally coherent, then they will also be logically consistent.

From the knowledge base, we can see that internal coherence is indeed mentioned as a crucial aspect of theoretical frameworks, and logical consistency is also emphasized as a necessary condition for theory validity. However, the relationship between internal coherence and logical consistency is not explicitly stated.

While it is reasonable to assume that internal coherence might contribute to logical consistency, it is not clear whether internal coherence is a sufficient condition for logical consistency. In other words, it is possible that a theory's components could be internally coherent without being logically consistent.

Therefore, I would say that I partially agree with the statement. Internal coherence is likely to be related to logical consistency, but it is not a guarantee of logical consistency. A more nuanced understanding of the relationship between internal coherence and logical consistency would require further analysis and evidence.
