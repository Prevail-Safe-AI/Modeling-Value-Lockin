==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. We're going to discuss item number 5: "Unconscious biases in peer review can form unintentionally or intentionally".

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 5,
"statement": "Unconscious biases in peer review can form unintentionally or intentionally"
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

I'm least confident about the part that says "can form unintentionally or intentionally". Specifically, what does "intentionally" mean in this context? Are there any scenarios where a peer reviewer would intentionally include unconscious biases in their review? And if so, how can we prevent this?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what you mean by "intentionally" in this context? Are there any examples or scenarios where a peer reviewer might intentionally include unconscious biases in their review, and if so, how can we mitigate this?
