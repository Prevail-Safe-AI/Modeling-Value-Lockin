==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the item: `{
  "id": 46,
  "statement": "Theoretical soundness requires internal consistency, empirical evidence, and external validation."
}`

I'm least confident about the aspect that goes into determining theoretical soundness. In other words, what exactly does it mean by "internal consistency", "empirical evidence", and "external validation"?

Could you elaborate on what you think these three components mean and how they contribute to theoretical soundness?
