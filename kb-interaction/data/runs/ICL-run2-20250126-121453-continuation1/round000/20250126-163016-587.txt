==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying an aspect of the item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about.

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 82,
  "statement": "Epigenetic modifications influence chromatin structure, regulating gene expression by altering accessibility."
}
```

I'm a bit uncertain about the phrase "altering accessibility". Could you elaborate on what it means to alter accessibility in the context of chromatin structure and gene expression? How do epigenetic modifications specifically affect accessibility?

Please share your understanding!
