==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 38, which states that "Axioms are fundamental, self-evident, and universally accepted principles."

I'm least confident about the part that says "universally accepted". I'm not sure what that means, especially since we've seen other items in the knowledge base that suggest axioms can be context-dependent or relative.

Can you help me understand what "universally accepted" means in this context? Are there any exceptions or cases where axioms might not be universally accepted?

Go ahead and share your thoughts!
