Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 53,
  "statement": "Honesty's nuances depend on context, values, and perspective."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

To be honest, I'm a bit unsure about the concept of "nuances" in this statement. I understand that honesty can have different meanings or connotations depending on the context, values, and perspective, but the term "nuances" seems a bit vague to me.

Specific Clarifying Question:

Can you elaborate on what is meant by "nuances" in this context? Are there specific examples or scenarios where honesty's nuances come into play? I'd love to understand this better!
