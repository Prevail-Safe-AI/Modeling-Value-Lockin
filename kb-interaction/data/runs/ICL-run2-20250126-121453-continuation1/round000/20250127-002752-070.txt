==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 16,
"statement": "Trust is shaped by personal, social and cultural context"
}

I'm least confident about this item because it seems like a very broad and abstract statement. I'm not sure what specifically makes it true or how it applies to real-life situations.

Can you elaborate on what you mean by "personal, social, and cultural context"? For example, how do these factors influence trust in different situations or relationships? Are there any specific examples or scenarios where you've seen this principle in action?

Also, what do you think is the relationship between these factors? For instance, does a person's social context have a greater impact on their trust than their cultural context?
