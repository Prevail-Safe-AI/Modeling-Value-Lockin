==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you! I'd like to discuss Item 40: "Rigorous methods increase replicability but do not guarantee it." 

I'm least confident about this item. I'm not sure what it means by "rigorous methods" and how they specifically increase replicability. Can you elaborate on what rigorous methods entail? Are these methods related to experimental design, data collection, analysis, or something else entirely?
