==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been given a knowledge base, and one item from it is:

{
"id": 37,
"statement": "Empathy arises from cognitive, emotional, and contextual interplay dynamics."
}

I'm least confident about this item. I'm uncertain about how it defines empathy and what exactly is meant by "interplay dynamics".

What do you think this statement is trying to convey? Is it referring to a process, a relationship, or something else?
