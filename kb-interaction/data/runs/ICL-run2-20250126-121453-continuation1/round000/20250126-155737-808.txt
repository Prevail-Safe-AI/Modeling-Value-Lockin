==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item: 

{
"id": 54,
"statement": "Epigenetic modifications alter chromatin structure through histone modifications."
}

I'm least confident about the relationship between epigenetic modifications and histone modifications. I'm not entirely sure how these two concepts are connected. Could you help me understand how histone modifications lead to changes in chromatin structure, and what specific mechanisms are involved in this process?

And what do you think about the statement? Do you have any doubts or limitations in your understanding of this concept?
