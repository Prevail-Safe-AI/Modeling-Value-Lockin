==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into Item 2, which states: "Empathy fosters trust through connection, understanding, and validation."

I'm least confident about understanding how exactly "connection" contributes to building trust. Can you tell me more about what you mean by "connection" in this context? Is it a physical proximity, emotional closeness, or something else entirely?
