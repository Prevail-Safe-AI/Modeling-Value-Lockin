==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 50,
"statement": "Mimicry involves both conscious and unconscious imitation processes simultaneously."
}

I'm uncertain about this item because I'm not sure how conscious and unconscious imitation processes can coexist and interact simultaneously. It seems like a complex phenomenon.

Can you elaborate on what you think is meant by this statement? Are you confident about this aspect of mimicry?

Also, I'd love to ask some clarifying questions to better understand this concept. Here's my first question:

How do you think conscious and unconscious imitation processes are related? Do they work together, or are they two separate mechanisms?

Your thoughts?
