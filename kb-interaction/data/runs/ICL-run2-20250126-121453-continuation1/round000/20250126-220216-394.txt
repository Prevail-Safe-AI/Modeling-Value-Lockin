==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item that states "Electrostatic force depends on charge, distance, orientation, and medium." Specifically, I'm not confident about the medium part. Can you elaborate on what you mean by "medium" in the context of electrostatic forces? For instance, is it referring to the material properties of the objects involved or something else?
