==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. It's:

{
  "id": 88,
  "statement": "Unconscious biases in peer review lead to biased evaluation."
}

I'm uncertain about this item because I'm not entirely sure how unconscious biases can affect peer review, and what exactly it means by "biased evaluation". My understanding of peer review is that it's a rigorous process where experts assess the quality and validity of research, but I'm not convinced that unconscious biases would necessarily lead to biased evaluations.

Can you help me understand this concept better?
