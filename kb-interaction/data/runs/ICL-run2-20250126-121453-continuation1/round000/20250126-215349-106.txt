==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about.

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 21,
  "statement": "Coulomb's Law a simplification of electrostatic force with assumptions"
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
The idea that Coulomb's Law is a simplification of electrostatic force with assumptions.

Specifically, I'm unsure about what kind of assumptions are made in Coulomb's Law and how they affect the accuracy of the calculations. Are the assumptions minor or significant? Do they only apply in certain situations or is it a general simplification?

Specific Clarifying Question:
What are the specific assumptions made in Coulomb's Law and how do they impact the application of the law in different situations?
