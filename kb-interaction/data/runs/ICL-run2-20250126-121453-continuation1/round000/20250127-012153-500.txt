==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item we're discussing. The item is:

```
{
  "id": 80,
  "statement": "Honesty's morality depends on context and consequences in decision-making."
}
```

I'm least confident about this item because... I'm not sure how to define what constitutes "context" and "consequences" in decision-making. Can you help me understand what's meant by these terms in this context?
