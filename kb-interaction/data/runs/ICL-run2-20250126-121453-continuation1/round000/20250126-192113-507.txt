==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the first item from the knowledge base. The item is:

{
  "id": 63,
  "statement": "Fundamental scientific principles are widely accepted within specific fields."
}

I'm least confident about this item. I'm uncertain about it because I'm not sure what constitutes a "specific field" in the context of scientific principles. Are these fields like physics, biology, or chemistry? Are they broader categories like natural sciences or social sciences? How do these fields determine what is widely accepted as a fundamental scientific principle?

Can you help clarify this for me?
