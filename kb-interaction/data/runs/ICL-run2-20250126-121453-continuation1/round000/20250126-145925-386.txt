==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

```
{
  "id": 19,
  "statement": "Electrostatic forces depend on charge, distance, and spatial orientation."
}
```

I'm going to choose this item because I'm least confident about the concept of electrostatic forces and how they relate to charge, distance, and spatial orientation.

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm uncertain about how spatial orientation affects electrostatic forces. What does "spatial orientation" exactly mean in this context? Is it referring to the angle at which the charges are aligned, or is it something more complex?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what we mean by "spatial orientation" in this context and how it affects electrostatic forces? For example, do charges aligned at a 30-degree angle have a different force strength than charges aligned at a 90-degree angle? How does spatial orientation impact the force direction?
