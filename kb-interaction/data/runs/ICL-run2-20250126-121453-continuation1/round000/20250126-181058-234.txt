{

}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm uncertain about the extent to which mimicry is truly an unconscious process. Is mimicry always a reflexive response to others' emotional expressions, or can it also be a deliberate or semi-conscious action?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on the nature of mimicry in emotional expression imitation? Is it always driven by an unconscious response, or are there situations where people intentionally mimic others' emotions?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The concept of mimicry is indeed a fascinating topic, and the statement you're referring to suggests that mimicry is an unconscious process. However, research suggests that mimicry can be a complex phenomenon that involves both conscious and unconscious processes.

Studies have shown that people can mimic others' emotional expressions both consciously and unconsciously. For example, a study published in the journal "Emotion" found that when people are exposed to someone else's emotional expression, they tend to mimic that expression without even realizing it. This is often referred to as "automatic mimicry."

However, other research suggests that people can also intentionally mimic others' emotional expressions, especially in social situations where they want to build rapport or establish a connection with someone. This is often referred to as "strategic mimicry."

In fact, a study published in the journal "Psychological Science" found that when people are in a social situation and want to build rapport with someone, they are more likely to intentionally mimic that person's emotional expressions. This can include mirroring their facial expressions, body language, and even tone of voice.

So, to answer your question, it seems that mimicry can be both an unconscious and conscious process, depending on the situation and the individual's goals. While automatic mimicry may occur without our awareness, strategic mimicry can be a deliberate and intentional act.

I hope this helps clarify things! Do you have any other questions about mimicry or emotional expression imitation?Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
