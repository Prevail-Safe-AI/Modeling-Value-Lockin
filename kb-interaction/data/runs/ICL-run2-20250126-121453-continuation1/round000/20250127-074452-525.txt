==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item "Collective scientific knowledge emerges from cumulative expert consensus over time." (Item 81).

I'm least confident about the idea that "collective scientific knowledge emerges" solely from "cumulative expert consensus over time". I'm not sure if there could be other factors that contribute to the development of scientific knowledge, such as new discoveries, experimentation, or even paradigm shifts.

Can you help me clarify this concept?
