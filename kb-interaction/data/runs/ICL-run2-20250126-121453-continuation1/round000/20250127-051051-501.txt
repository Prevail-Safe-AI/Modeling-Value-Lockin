==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss Item 86:

{
"id": 86,
"statement": "Logical coherence stems from harmonious integration of assumptions, consistency, and complexity."
}

I'm unsure about this item, specifically the phrase "harmonious integration of assumptions, consistency, and complexity." Can you help me understand what this means?

What does "harmonious integration" entail in this context? How do assumptions, consistency, and complexity come together to form logical coherence?

Also, what is the relationship between these three components? Are they equally important, or is one more crucial than the others in achieving logical coherence?
