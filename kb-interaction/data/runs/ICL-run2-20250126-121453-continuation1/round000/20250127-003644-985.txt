==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start with the statement: "Internal influences on trust include personal biases, emotions, and experiences."

I'm a bit uncertain about this item, as I'm not sure I fully understand what it means by "internal influences". Can you help me clarify what this statement is trying to say?

Specifically, what do you think it means by "internal influences on trust"? Is it referring to factors that are within an individual, such as their own thoughts, feelings, and experiences, that affect their ability to trust others or themselves? Or is it referring to some other kind of influence that's not necessarily related to personal experiences?

I'd love to get your take on this!
