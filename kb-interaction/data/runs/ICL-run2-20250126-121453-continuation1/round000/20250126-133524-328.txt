==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 94: "Consistency and coherence ensure logical soundness through consensus."

I'm supposed to identify one aspect of this item that I'm least confident about. Upon reviewing the item, I'm not entirely convinced about the relationship between consensus and logical soundness.

What do you think about the phrase "through consensus"? Can you help me understand how consensus contributes to logical soundness?

Also, I'd love to clarify what the authors mean by "ensure logical soundness". Is it about guaranteeing the validity of an argument or is it more about detecting inconsistencies?
