==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive in.

The item is:
```
{
  "id": 46,
  "statement": "Internal consistency necessary but insufficient for logical coherence requires empirical evidence."
}
```

I'm a bit uncertain about the aspect that internal consistency is necessary but insufficient for logical coherence. Could you elaborate on what you mean by insufficient? Is it that internal consistency alone is not enough to guarantee logical coherence, or is there something more missing?

What are your thoughts on this statement?
