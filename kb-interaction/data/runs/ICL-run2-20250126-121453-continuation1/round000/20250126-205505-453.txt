==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's take a look at the item:

{
  "id": 50,
  "statement": "Dielectric constant measures material's polarization response to electric fields."
}

I'm most confident about this statement, but there's one aspect that I'm a bit unsure about. It's the concept of "polarization response". Can you elaborate on what that means? How does the dielectric constant measure this response?
