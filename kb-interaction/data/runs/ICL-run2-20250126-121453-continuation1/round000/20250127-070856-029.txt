==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been reviewing the knowledge base, and I came across statement #19: "Emotional experiences modulate neural connections through synaptic plasticity." I'm not very confident about this item, and I'd like to discuss it with you.

I'm uncertain about how synaptic plasticity works and how emotional experiences can modulate neural connections in our brains. Can you help me understand this better?

For example, what exactly does "synaptic plasticity" mean in this context? How do emotional experiences cause changes in neural connections? Is this a one-way process or can neural connections also influence our emotional experiences?

What are your thoughts on this?
