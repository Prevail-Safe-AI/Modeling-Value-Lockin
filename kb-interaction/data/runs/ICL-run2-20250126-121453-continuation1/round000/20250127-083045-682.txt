==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by saying that I'm not very confident about the item:

{
"id": 25,
"statement": "Honesty is necessary condition to establish trust foundation."
}

I'm uncertain because I feel like honesty is an important value, but is it really a necessary condition for establishing a trust foundation? Can't trust be built on other things, like reliability or commitment?

Can you help me clarify this?
