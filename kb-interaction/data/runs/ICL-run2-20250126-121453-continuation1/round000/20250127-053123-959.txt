==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 63,
"statement": "Language ambiguity arises from imprecise term definitions causing interpretability issues"
}

Currently, I'm least confident about this aspect. I'm uncertain about how exactly imprecise term definitions contribute to interpretability issues. Could you elaborate on why you think language ambiguity arises from imprecise term definitions?

And, if I may ask, what does it mean by "causing interpretability issues"?
