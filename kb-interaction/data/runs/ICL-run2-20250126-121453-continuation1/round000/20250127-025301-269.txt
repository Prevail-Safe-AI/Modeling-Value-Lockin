==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss Item 17:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 17,
"statement": "Rigorous research requires deliberate planning before data collection."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm uncertain about how the phrase "deliberate planning" applies to the research process. Can we elaborate on what this means in the context of research?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you give an example of deliberate planning in research that involves more than just setting a clear research question?
