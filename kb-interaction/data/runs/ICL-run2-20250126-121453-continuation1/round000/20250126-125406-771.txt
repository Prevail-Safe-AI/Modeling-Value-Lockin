==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, we're going to discuss the item "Logical soundness requires coherent harmony among truth, validity, consistency, accuracy" (id: 53).

I'm going to be honest, I'm least confident about the aspect of "coherent harmony". What makes you think that logical soundness requires harmony among these concepts? Is it because they all work together to form a logically coherent system?
