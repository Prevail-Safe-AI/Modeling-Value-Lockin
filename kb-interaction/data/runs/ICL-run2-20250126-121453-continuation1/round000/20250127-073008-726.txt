==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, we're discussing the item from the knowledge base:

{
"id": 24,
"statement": "Internal coherence establishes logical connections between theoretical framework components."
}

I'm least confident about this aspect: I'm not entirely sure what is meant by "establishes logical connections" in this context. Can you elaborate on why you think internal coherence is necessary for establishing logical connections between theoretical framework components?

In other words, what do you think is meant by "logical connections" in this context, and how does internal coherence achieve this?
