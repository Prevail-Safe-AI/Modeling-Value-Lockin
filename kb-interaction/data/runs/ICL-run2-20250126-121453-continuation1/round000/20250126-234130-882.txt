==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's discuss the item: "Theoretical soundness requires internal consistency, logical coherence, and evidence." Specifically, I'm least confident about the aspect of logical coherence. 

Things I'm Uncertain About This Item:
The relationship between internal consistency and logical coherence in the context of theoretical soundness.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on how internal consistency relates to logical coherence in the concept of theoretical soundness? In other words, is internal consistency a necessary condition for logical coherence, or are they separate concepts that contribute to theoretical soundness?
