==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you! I'd like to discuss the item:

```
{
  "id": 60,
  "statement": "Epigenetic modifications affect chromatin structure and gene expression patterns."
}
```

I'm least confident about this aspect. I'm uncertain about how epigenetic modifications specifically affect chromatin structure and gene expression patterns.

Can you elaborate why you think epigenetic modifications have this impact? For instance, what are some specific examples or mechanisms by which epigenetic modifications can influence chromatin structure and gene expression?

Then, I'd like to ask a specific clarifying question: How do epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation or histone modifications, interact with chromatin remodeling complexes to regulate gene expression?
