==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 87,
"statement": "Method validation ensures research quality, but not absolute accuracy"
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm least confident about the statement's meaning. I'm not sure what it means by "research quality" and "absolute accuracy". Are "research quality" and "absolute accuracy" interchangeable terms, or are they distinct concepts?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what the author means by "research quality" in this context? Is it referring to the overall validity, reliability, and trustworthiness of the research findings, or something else?

Your thoughts?
