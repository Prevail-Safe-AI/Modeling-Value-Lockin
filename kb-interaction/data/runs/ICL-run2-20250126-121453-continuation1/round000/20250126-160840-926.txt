==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item:

"{ "id": 74, "statement": "Peer review can be culturally biased and flawed." }"

I'm least confident about this item. I'd like to understand why it's worth mentioning that peer review can be flawed and culturally biased. Can you elaborate on what you think the author means by this statement?

Also, what are some examples of how cultural bias and flaws can occur in the peer review process?

And finally, what are the implications of this statement on the credibility of academic research?
