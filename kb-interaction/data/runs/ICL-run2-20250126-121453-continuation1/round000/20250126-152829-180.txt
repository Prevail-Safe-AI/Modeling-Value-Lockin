==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, let's dive into the knowledge base. I've taken a look at the statement:

"Axioms are widely accepted as true by scholarly consensus implicitly."

I'm least confident about this aspect: "widely accepted as true by scholarly consensus implicitly".

I'm unsure about what "scholarly consensus implicitly" means. It seems like it's implying that axioms are accepted without an explicit discussion or proof, but I'd like to clarify what's meant by "implicitly" and how this relates to the concept of axioms.

Can you elaborate on what you think "scholarly consensus implicitly" means in this context?
