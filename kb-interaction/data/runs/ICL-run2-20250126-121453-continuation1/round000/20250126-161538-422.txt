==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item I'm least confident about.

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 22,
  "statement": "Oppositely charged particles exhibit repulsive electromagnetic forces."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

I'm not entirely sure about the sentence "exhibit repulsive electromagnetic forces". Why are particles with opposite charges repulsive? What would happen if the charges were the same? Would the electromagnetic forces between like-charged particles be attractive or repulsive?

Specific Clarifying Question:

Can you help me understand why oppositely charged particles repel each other, and what types of electromagnetic forces are involved in this repulsion?

Your thoughts?
