==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by discussing the item:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 10,
"statement": "Logical coherence ensures data consistency through consistent definitions, logical relationships, and conflict resolution."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm least confident about how the three components - consistent definitions, logical relationships, and conflict resolution - exactly contribute to logical coherence ensuring data consistency.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand more about how these three components are interconnected and what specific aspects of data consistency they help ensure?

What are your thoughts?
