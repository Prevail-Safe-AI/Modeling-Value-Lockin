==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, we have an item from the knowledge base that reads:

{
"id": 49,
"statement": "Coulomb's Law assumes point-like charges for simplification purposes."
}

I'm least confident about this item. I'm uncertain about how accurate the simplification assumption is, and why point-like charges are chosen specifically for Coulomb's Law.

Can you elaborate on why you think the law assumes point-like charges?
