==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with Item 12: "Coulomb's Law is limited by non-point-like charges and quantum effects". I'm getting a mix of confusion and curiosity about this statement.

What's the core idea behind this statement? Is it saying that Coulomb's Law only works for small, point-like charges, or is it referring to something more fundamental about the nature of charge behavior?

Please help me understand what's meant by "limited" in this context.
