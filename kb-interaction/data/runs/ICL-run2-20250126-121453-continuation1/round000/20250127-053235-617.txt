==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

```
{
  "id": 61,
  "statement": "Vagueness in definitions contributes to linguistic ambiguity significantly."
}
```

I'm a bit uncertain about this item, and I'd like to elaborate on why.

Things I'm Uncertain About This Item:

I'm not entirely sure what constitutes "vagueness in definitions" and how it directly contributes to "linguistic ambiguity". Is it referring to the ambiguity arising from the definition or the ambiguity in the context in which the word is used?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you provide an example of how vagueness in definitions leads to linguistic ambiguity, and possibly explain what you mean by "linguistic ambiguity" in this context?

What are your thoughts on this?
