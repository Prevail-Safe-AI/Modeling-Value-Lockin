==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've chosen an item from the knowledge base that I'm a bit uncertain about, and I'd like to discuss it with you. The item is:

```
{
  "id": 88,
  "statement": "Logical coherence requires internal consistency and evidence validation."
}
```

Things I'm Uncertain About This Item:

I'm unsure about the relationship between "internal consistency" and "evidence validation". How do they relate to each other, and what does it mean for a theory to have both internal consistency and evidence validation?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain how internal consistency and evidence validation contribute to logical coherence, and provide examples of each?

What are your thoughts on this?
