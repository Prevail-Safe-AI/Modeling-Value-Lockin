Let's dive into it.

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 24,
  "statement": "Theoretical soundness integrates internal consistency, accuracy, and practical relevance harmoniously."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm a bit uncertain about what exactly "harmoniously" means in this context. How does it integrate internal consistency, accuracy, and practical relevance in a harmonious way?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what is meant by "harmoniously" in this statement, and how it differs from simply combining these three aspects of theoretical soundness?
