==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the item from the knowledge base:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 46,
  "statement": "Mimicry involves unconsciously imitating others' emotional expressions."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm uncertain about the extent to which mimicry is truly an unconscious process. Is mimicry always a reflexive response to others' emotional expressions, or can it also be a deliberate or semi-conscious action?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on the nature of mimicry in emotional expression imitation? Is it always driven by an unconscious response, or are there situations where people intentionally mimic others' emotions?
