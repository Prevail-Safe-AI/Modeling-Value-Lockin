==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
" id": 74,
"statement": "Non-covalent \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking stabilizes DNA's aromatic base pairs."
}

I'm the least confident about this item because I'm not familiar with the concept of non-covalent \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking in DNA structure. I'd love to understand it better.

Can you explain to me what exactly means by "non-covalent \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking" in the context of DNA structure? How does it stabilize DNA's aromatic base pairs?
