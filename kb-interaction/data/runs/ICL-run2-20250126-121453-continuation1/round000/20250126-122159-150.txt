==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

`{
  "id": 54,
  "statement": "Phosphodiester bonds covalently link sugar and phosphate groups in DNA."
}`

I'm least confident about the aspect: "covalently link". Could you help me understand this statement better? Can you elaborate why phosphodiester bonds "link" sugar and phosphate groups in DNA? Is it a specific chemical reaction or mechanism I'm missing?

Additionally, what are some specific biological or chemical processes that involve phosphodiester bonds linking sugar and phosphate groups in DNA?
