==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by saying that I've been presented with a knowledge base, and I'm supposed to identify an aspect of it that I'm least confident about. And the item that caught my attention is:

{
  "id": 78,
  "statement": "Coulomb's Law modified by medium dielectric constant and distance."
}

So, I'm least confident about this aspect. I'm not entirely sure what this means, or how Coulomb's Law is modified by the medium dielectric constant and distance. Can you tell me more about it? What does it mean? How does it work?
