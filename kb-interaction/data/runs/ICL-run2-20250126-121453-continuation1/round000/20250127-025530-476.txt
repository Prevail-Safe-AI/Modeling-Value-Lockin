==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's discuss the item "Rigorous research requires deliberate planning before data collection." From the knowledge base, I'm most confident about this statement, but one aspect that I'm least confident about is the assumption that "deliberate planning" is sufficient for rigorous research.

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I wonder if there are any counterexamples or exceptions to this rule. For instance, what if the research involves a rapid response or a novel methodology that can't be planned out in advance? Or what if the data collection process is more flexible and iterative, requiring adjustments and adaptations on the fly?

Can you help me clarify this uncertainty by elaborating on any potential exceptions or complexities you see?
