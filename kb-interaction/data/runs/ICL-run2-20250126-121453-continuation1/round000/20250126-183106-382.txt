==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you!

So, I'm looking at the item "Research validity includes internal, external, and construct validity measures." (item 46). I'm most uncertain about this item, but I'm least confident about the concept of "construct validity".

Can you tell me more about construct validity? How does it differ from internal and external validity? Is it also a measure of the accuracy and generalizability of research findings?

What are some examples of construct validity in research? Can you explain it in a simple and straightforward way?
