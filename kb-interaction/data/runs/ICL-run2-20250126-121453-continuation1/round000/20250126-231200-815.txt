==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 66,
"statement": "Cultural background internalizes moral values shaping honesty."
}

I'm least confident about this item. I'm unsure about how "internalizes" works in this context. What do you think it means to internalize moral values? How does this process occur, and how does it influence honesty?

Can you help clarify these points for me?
