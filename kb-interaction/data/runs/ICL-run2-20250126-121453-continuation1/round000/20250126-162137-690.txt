==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you!

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 92,
"statement": "Honesty is a universal moral principle, not relative."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not sure why the statement claims that honesty is a universal moral principle and not relative. I understand that honesty is often considered a valuable trait, but isn't the definition and practice of honesty influenced by cultural context and relativism?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand how the statement distinguishes between cultural relativity and a universal moral principle? Is there a specific perspective or argument that supports this claim?
