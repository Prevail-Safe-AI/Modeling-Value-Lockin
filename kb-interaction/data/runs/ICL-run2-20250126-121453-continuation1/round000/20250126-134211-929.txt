==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I've identified an aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about, which is the statement:

{
"id": 54,
"statement": "Logical soundness requires harmonious integration of truth, validity, and accuracy."
}

Honestly, I'm unsure about what exactly "harmonious integration" means in this context. Can you help me understand what this phrase is trying to convey? How do truth, validity, and accuracy need to be integrated for logical soundness?
