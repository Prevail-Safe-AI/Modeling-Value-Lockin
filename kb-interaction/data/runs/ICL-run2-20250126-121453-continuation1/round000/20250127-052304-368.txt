==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'd like to discuss item #12:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 12,
"statement": "Theoretical soundness evaluates a theory's internal coherence and empirical fit."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm unclear about the distinction between "internal coherence" and "empirical fit". Can you help me understand the difference between these two concepts? Specifically, what does "internal coherence" entail, and how does it relate to the "empirical fit" mentioned in the statement?

Can you elaborate on what you think these concepts mean?
