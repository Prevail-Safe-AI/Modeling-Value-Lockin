==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the statement: "Axioms provide foundation, direction, and constraints in theory development". 

I'm least confident about the role of axioms in theory development, specifically how they provide "direction" and "constraints". Can you elaborate on what you think this means, and why you think axioms have this impact on theory development?
