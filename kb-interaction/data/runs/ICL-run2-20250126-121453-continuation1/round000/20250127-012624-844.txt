==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's begin by identifying one aspect from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. I think it's the item:

{
"id": 75,
"statement": "Internal consistency necessary but insufficient for logical coherence."
}

I'm uncertain about this because I wonder what exactly is meant by "internal consistency" in this context. Is it referring to the internal logic within a theory or model? If so, how does that differ from logical coherence?

What are your thoughts on this item? Can you help me clarify what's meant by "internal consistency" here?
