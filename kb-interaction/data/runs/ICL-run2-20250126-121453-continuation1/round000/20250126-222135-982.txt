==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

The knowledge base we have is quite vast, and I'd like to focus on a specific item. Let's take a look at item 55: "Logical coherence is a necessary condition for theoretical soundness."

I'm not entirely confident about this statement. Can you help me understand why you think logical coherence is a necessary condition for theoretical soundness? What do you mean by logical coherence, and how does it contribute to theoretical soundness?
