==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 84: "Logical coherence ensures internal consistency and theoretical soundness."

I'm not sure what it means by "theoretical soundness". Can you elaborate on what that term implies? Is it another way of saying that logical coherence leads to a consistent theory? Or is there something more to it?

What are your thoughts on this?
