==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 27:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 27,
"statement": "Logical coherence isn't sufficient for scientific theories' internal consistency."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm uncertain about the relationship between logical coherence and internal consistency in scientific theories. I want to clarify what the statement is trying to say.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what the statement means by "internal consistency"? Is it referring to empirical data, predictive accuracy, or something else?
