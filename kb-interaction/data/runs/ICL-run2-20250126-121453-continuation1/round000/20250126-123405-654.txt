==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

"{ 'id': 15, 'statement': 'Honesty's moral rightness depends on context and potential harm.' }"

Item to Discuss:

"{ 'id': 15, 'statement': 'Honesty's moral rightness depends on context and potential harm.' }"

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

* Honestly, I'm not quite sure why honesty's moral rightness depends on context and potential harm. I'm unsure how these two factors relate to each other and how they influence the moral rightness of honesty.

Specific Clarifying Question:

* Can you explain how the context and potential harm affect the moral rightness of honesty? For example, in what specific situations would the moral rightness of honesty change?

What are your thoughts on this?
