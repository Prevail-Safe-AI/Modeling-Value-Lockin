==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item. I've chosen one aspect of it that I'm least confident about, which is:

```
{
  "id": 2,
  "statement": "Electrostatic force depends on charge, distance, orientation, and medium properties."
}
```

I'm uncertain about how the "medium properties" part affects the electrostatic force.

Can you elaborate on what you think "medium properties" refers to in this context, and how it impacts the force?

Also, what are some examples of "medium properties" that could influence electrostatic force?
