==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by discussing Item #98: "Theoretical soundness emerges from harmonious interaction of coherence, evidence, and relevance."

I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect. Can you elaborate on what you think is meant by "harmonious interaction of coherence, evidence, and relevance"? How do these three components work together to achieve theoretical soundness?
