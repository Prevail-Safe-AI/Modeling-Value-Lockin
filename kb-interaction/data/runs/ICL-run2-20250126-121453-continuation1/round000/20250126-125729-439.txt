==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm going to start by looking at Item 54:

 `
{
  "id": 54,
  "statement": "Ion-dipole and dipole-dipole forces stabilize molecules through electrostatic interactions."
}
`

I have to admit, I'm not entirely confident about this statement. I'd like to understand more about what "stabilize molecules" means in this context. Could you help me clarify that?

What do you think is meant by "stabilize molecules" in this statement?
