==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by saying that I'm not confident about the item: {
  "id": 97,
  "statement": "Electrostatic forces between charges depend on angle and distance."
}

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not sure how angle plays a role in electrostatic forces between charges. In my understanding, electrostatic forces are typically influenced by the magnitude and sign of the charges, as well as the distance between them. I'm not clear on how the angle between the charges affects the force.

Can you help me clarify this? Do you have any insights or examples that might help me understand the role of angle in electrostatic forces?
