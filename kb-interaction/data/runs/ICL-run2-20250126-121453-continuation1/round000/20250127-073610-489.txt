==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the item:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 6,
"statement": "Empirical evidence validation requires transparent documentation of research process."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

I'm least confident about the phrase "transparent documentation of research process". I'm not sure what specific aspects of the research process need to be documented in a transparent way. For instance, is it the data collection methods, the data analysis procedures, the experimental design, or all of these? Could you elaborate on what you think the key elements are that need to be transparently documented?

Specific Clarifying Question:
What specific elements of the research process do you think are crucial to be transparently documented for empirical evidence validation?
