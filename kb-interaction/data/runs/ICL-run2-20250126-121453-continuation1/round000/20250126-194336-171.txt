==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I think I'll start by saying that I'm a bit uncertain about the item from the knowledge base:

```
{
  "id": 27,
  "statement": "Logical coherence and consistency are necessary but insufficient conditions."
}
```

Specifically, I'm wondering what the statement means by "necessary but insufficient conditions". Can you elaborate on what you think this means?
