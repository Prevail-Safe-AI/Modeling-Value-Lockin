==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item "Cultural norms influence honesty perception through interdependent factors." From what I can gather from the knowledge base, this statement suggests that cultural norms have an impact on how we perceive honesty, and that these norms interact with other factors to shape our perception.

However, I'm not entirely confident about this aspect. I'd like to clarify: what do you mean by "interdependent factors"? Are these other factors that culture interacts with, or are they more like subprocesses that add up to influence honesty perception? And how do these factors specifically interact with cultural norms to shape our perception of honesty?

Can you help me understand this better?
