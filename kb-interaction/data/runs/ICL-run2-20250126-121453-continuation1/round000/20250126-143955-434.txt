==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 98:

```
{
  "id": 98,
  "statement": "Harmonious integration ensures logical soundness through truth, validity, and accuracy."
}
```

I'm least confident about this item because I'm not entirely clear what it means by "harmonious integration". Can you elaborate on what you think this phrase refers to in the context of logical soundness?

(And feel free to ask me anything in return, of course!)
