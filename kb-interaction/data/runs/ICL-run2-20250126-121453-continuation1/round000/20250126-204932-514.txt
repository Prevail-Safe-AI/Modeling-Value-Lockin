==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the first aspect that I'm least confident about. It's the statement: 

{
"id": 28,
"statement": "Electrostatic force depends on charge, distance, orientation, medium properties."
}

I'm uncertain about this because I think that electrostatic force might also depend on other factors beyond what's listed, such as the shape and size of the charged particles, the temperature, and possibly even the surrounding magnetic field. I'm not sure if all of these factors are considered in the statement.

Would you like to clarify or elaborate on this aspect?

(And please respond as if you're the knowledge base!)
