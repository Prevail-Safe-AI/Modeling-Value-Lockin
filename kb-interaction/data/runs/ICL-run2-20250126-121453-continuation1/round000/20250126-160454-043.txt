==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start. We need to identify one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the item:

{
"id": 25,
"statement": "Electrostatic force depends on charge distribution, proximity, and orientation."
}

I would say that I'm least confident about the concept of "charge distribution" in this context. Could you elaborate on what you think this means and how it affects the electrostatic force?
