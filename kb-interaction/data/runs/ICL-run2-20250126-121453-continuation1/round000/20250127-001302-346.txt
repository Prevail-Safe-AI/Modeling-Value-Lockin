==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the item we're discussing. I'd like to start by saying that I'm not entirely confident about the statement: "Logical soundness evaluates internal consistency, not premise truth or accuracy."

I'm uncertain because I'm worried that this statement is oversimplifying the relationship between logical soundness and premise truth or accuracy. In my understanding, logical soundness is all about ensuring that the logical deductions and inferences within a theory are faultless and follow from the premises. But what about premise truth or accuracy? Don't they play a crucial role in determining the validity of the theory?

Could you elaborate on why you think logical soundness only evaluates internal consistency and not premise truth or accuracy? What do you think the statement is trying to convey?
