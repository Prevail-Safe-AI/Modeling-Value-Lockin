==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to explore the aspect I'm least confident about. The item is:

```
{
  "id": 86,
  "statement": "Theoretical soundness requires interconnected logical coherence, empirical validation, consistency."
}
```

I'm uncertain about how these three components (logical coherence, empirical validation, and consistency) are connected and how they contribute to theoretical soundness.

Can you help me understand why these three components need to be interconnected? What does it mean for them to be "interconnected" specifically?
