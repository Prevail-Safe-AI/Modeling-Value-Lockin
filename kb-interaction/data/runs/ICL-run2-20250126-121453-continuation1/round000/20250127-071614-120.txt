==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's discuss the item:

{
"id": 59,
"statement": "Cognitive biases emerge from emotional and social experiences influencing thought"
}

I'm not perfectly sure about this item, and I'd like to clarify my understanding. What exactly do you mean by "emotional and social experiences influencing thought"? Can you give an example of how this works? For instance, how does an emotional experience, like feeling anxious, influence our thought patterns?
