==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item from the knowledge base:

{
  "id": 98,
  "statement": "Cultural norms shape honesty's definition and practice globally."
}

I'm least confident about this item, specifically the part where it says "globally". I'm not sure what that means exactly. Are cultural norms really capable of shaping honesty's definition and practice on a global scale, considering the diverse cultural contexts and nuances around the world?

Can you help me understand this better?
