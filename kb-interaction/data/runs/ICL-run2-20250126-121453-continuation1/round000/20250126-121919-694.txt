==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the statement "Consistency may be prioritized over truth in uncertain situations." (Item 31)

I'm a bit uncertain about this item because it seems to be saying that in certain situations, being consistent is more important than telling the truth. This goes against the idea that honesty is always the best policy, and it's something that I was taught since childhood. I'm not sure what kind of situations the author is referring to, or when it would be acceptable to prioritize consistency over truth.

Can you help me understand this better? Are there certain situations where this might make sense, or is this just a general statement that I shouldn't take literally?
