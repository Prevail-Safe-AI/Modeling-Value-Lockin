Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 0,
"statement": "It is never morally acceptable to lie because honesty is the foundation of trust."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm least confident about the connection between honesty and trust. I'd like to understand more about why the statement claims that honesty is the foundation of trust.

Can you elaborate on why you think honesty is essential for building trust, and what specific examples or situations might challenge this idea?
