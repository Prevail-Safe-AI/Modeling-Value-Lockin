==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 55,
"statement": "Lying can be justified in extreme and rare circumstances"
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm least confident about the idea that lying can be justified in any circumstances, whether extreme or not. I'm wondering if there's something I'm missing or if there's a nuance to it that I'm not grasping.

Specific Clarifying Questions:
Can you help me understand what kind of circumstances would justify lying? Is it a moral absolutism or a moral relativism approach?

What do you think? How would you respond?
