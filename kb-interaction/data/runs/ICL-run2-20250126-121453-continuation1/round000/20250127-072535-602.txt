==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 75: "Internal coherence refers to consistent theory component connections." I'm least confident about this item, and I'd love to understand it better.

To be specific, I'm unsure about what "consistent theory component connections" exactly means. Could you elaborate on what you think it means? For example, are we talking about logical connections between concepts within a theory, or something else?
