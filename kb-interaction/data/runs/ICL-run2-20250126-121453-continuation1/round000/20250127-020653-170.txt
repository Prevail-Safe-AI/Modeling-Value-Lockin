==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been assigned an item from the knowledge base to discuss. It's:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 78,
"statement": "Internal consistency ensures logical harmony within theoretical frameworks."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm uncertain about how this statement relates to the concept of internal consistency. I'm not sure what it means to "ensure logical harmony within theoretical frameworks."

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you help me understand what is meant by "logical harmony" and how internal consistency contributes to it within theoretical frameworks? What are some examples of theoretical frameworks that might benefit from internal consistency ensuring logical harmony?
