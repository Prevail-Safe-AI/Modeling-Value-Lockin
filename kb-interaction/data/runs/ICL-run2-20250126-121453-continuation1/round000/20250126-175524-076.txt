==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item from the knowledge base:

{
  "id": 26,
  "statement": "Orientation affects electric field lines, altering electrostatic force strength."
}

I'm least confident about this item. I'm unsure about how orientation affects electric field lines and, in turn, alters electrostatic force strength.

Can you help clarify what this item means and why?
