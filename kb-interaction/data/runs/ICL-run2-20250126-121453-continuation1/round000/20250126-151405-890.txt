==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. It is:

{
"id": 1,
"statement": "Honesty credibility arises from consistent character and integrity displays."
}

I'm uncertain about this item because I'm not entirely sure what is meant by "integrity displays". What kind of actions or behaviors constitute "integrity displays", and how do they relate to building credibility?

Can you help me understand this aspect better?
