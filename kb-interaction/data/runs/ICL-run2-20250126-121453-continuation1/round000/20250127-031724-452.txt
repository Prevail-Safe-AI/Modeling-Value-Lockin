==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been asked to discuss a specific item from the knowledge base, which is:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 87,
"statement": "Logical coherence emerges from iterative refinement of consistency and accuracy."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

I'm uncertain about the relationship between "iterative refinement" and "logical coherence". Can you elaborate on why the statement suggests that logical coherence emerges from iterative refinement, instead of being a direct result of consistency and accuracy?

Specific Clarifying Question:

Can you provide an example or explain how iterative refinement of consistency and accuracy leads to logical coherence?
