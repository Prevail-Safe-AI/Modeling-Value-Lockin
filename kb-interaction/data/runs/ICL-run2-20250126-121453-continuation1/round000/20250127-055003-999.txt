==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 53,
"statement": "Cognitive biases arise from reciprocal thinking, emotions, and context influences."
}

I'm least confident about this item because I'm not really sure what they mean by "reciprocal thinking". Can you elaborate on what they're trying to say with that phrase?

Also, what kind of influences do they mean by "context influences"? Is it the social context, the environment, or something else?
