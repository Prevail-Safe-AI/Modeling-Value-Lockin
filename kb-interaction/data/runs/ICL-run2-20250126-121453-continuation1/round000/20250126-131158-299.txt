==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the statement: "Epigenetic modifications regulate gene expression through chromatin structure alterations."

I'm curious about the relationship between epigenetic modifications and chromatin structure. Can you elaborate on what you think chromatin structure alterations are and how they directly impact gene expression?
