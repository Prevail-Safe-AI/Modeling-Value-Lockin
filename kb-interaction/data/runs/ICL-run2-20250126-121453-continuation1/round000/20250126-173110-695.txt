==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the topic of axioms in science.

According to the item:

"Axioms are assumptions guiding scientific research, not arbitrary claims"

I am a bit uncertain about this item. I'd like to clarify what kind of assumptions are considered axioms in science. Are they necessarily universally accepted or are they subject to change as new evidence emerges?

Can you help me understand this better? Maybe we can discuss some specific examples in different scientific fields?
