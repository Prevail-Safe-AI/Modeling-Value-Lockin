==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start by discussing the statement: 

`{
  "id": 52,
  "statement": "Electrostatic force depends on charge, distance, orientation, and medium properties."
}`

This statement claims that electrostatic force depends on four factors: charge, distance, orientation, and medium properties. 

I'm a bit uncertain about the medium properties part. What exactly does it mean by "medium properties"?
