==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'd like to discuss item 27, which states: "Logical coherence relies on empirical validation, relevance, and sound methodology."

To be honest, I'm a bit uncertain about this statement. Specifically, I'm unsure about what exactly is meant by "sound methodology" in this context. Can you help me understand what a "sound methodology" is in relation to logical coherence?

In other words, what makes a methodology sound, and how does it contribute to logical coherence?
