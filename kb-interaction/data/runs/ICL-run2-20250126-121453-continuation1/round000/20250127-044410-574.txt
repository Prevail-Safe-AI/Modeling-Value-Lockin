==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item: 

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 72,
  "statement": "Empathy requires genuine understanding, emotional connection, and resonant attunement."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm least confident about how to distinguish between the three components: genuine understanding, emotional connection, and resonant attunement. It seems to me that these components might be related and build upon each other, but I'm not sure how to differentiate them in practice.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what you mean by "emotional connection" in this context? How does it differ from "genuine understanding", and how do you establish a connection between the two?
