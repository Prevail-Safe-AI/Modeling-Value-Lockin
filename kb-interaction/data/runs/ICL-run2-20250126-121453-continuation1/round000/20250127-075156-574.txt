==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start by identifying one aspect of this item from knowledge base that I'm least confident about. I've chosen item number 65:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 65,
"statement": "Biases in research design, collection, and analysis distort conclusions."
}

Things I'm Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not entirely sure how biases in research design, collection, and analysis can lead to distorted conclusions. Can you help clarify this for me?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you provide an example of a study where biases in research design, collection, and analysis led to distorted conclusions?
