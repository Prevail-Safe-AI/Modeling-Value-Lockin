==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the statement: "Theoretical soundness encompasses logical coherence, empirical validation, and real-world relevance."

I'm least confident about the aspect of "real-world relevance". Can you elaborate on what you think this means? How do you tie the concept of logical coherence and empirical validation to real-world relevance?
