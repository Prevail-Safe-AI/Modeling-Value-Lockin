==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, we're discussing item 93 from the knowledge base, which states: "Electrostatic force depends on various factors beyond charge and distance." I'm the one who's least confident about this aspect.

Things I'm uncertain about this item:

* What are these "various factors beyond charge and distance" that affect electrostatic force? We've been taught that electrostatic force is influenced by charge, distance, and orientation, but there may be other factors at play.

Specific clarifying question:

* Can you help me understand what specific factors beyond charge and distance are being referred to in this statement, and how do these factors impact the electrostatic force?
