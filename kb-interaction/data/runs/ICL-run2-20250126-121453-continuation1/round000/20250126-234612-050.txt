==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into it then!

I'd like to discuss the knowledge base statement:

{
"id": 67,
"statement": "Internal consistency crucial for logical coherence in theories and concepts"
}

I'm not confident about this aspect because I'm not sure how internal consistency directly affects logical coherence in theories and concepts. Can you help me understand this better?

Specifically, what kind of internal consistency are we talking about here? Is it within a theory, within a concept, or across different theories and concepts? How does this consistency contribute to logical coherence?

Please share your thoughts!
