==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's focus on the item:

{
"id": 46,
"statement": "Internal consistency ensures logical coherence and validity in theories."
}

I'm not entirely confident about this aspect. I'm unsure what exactly constitutes "internal consistency" and how it ensures "logical coherence and validity" in theories.

Can you help me elaborate on this statement? What does "internal consistency" mean in the context of theories, and how does it relate to logical coherence and validity?
