==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 60: "Internal coherence requires logical consistency and empirical validation." I'm not very confident about this item and would like to delve deeper into it.

To be honest, I'm a bit unsure about what "internal coherence" really means in this context. Is it referring to the internal consistency of a theoretical framework, or is it something broader? And what does "empirical validation" add to the mix? Does it mean that the internal coherence needs to be validated by real-world data or observations?

Can you help me out and shed some light on these uncertainties?
