==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the item: "Cultural background shapes honesty through learned moral values, social norms."

I'd like to know more about what specifically is meant by "learned moral values" and "social norms". How does the cultural background influence an individual's sense of honesty? Is it purely through the explicit teachings or values that are consciously learned, or are there also implicit mechanisms at play?

What are your thoughts on this?
