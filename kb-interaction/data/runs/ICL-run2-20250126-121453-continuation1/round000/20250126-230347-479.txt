==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been given a task to discuss one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. I've chosen item #98:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 98,
"statement": "Honesty is a necessary but insufficient condition for trust."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

* I'm not entirely sure what is meant by "insufficient condition". Is it saying that honesty alone is not enough to build trust, but it's still an important factor?

Specific Clarifying Question:
* Can you elaborate on what is meant by an "insufficient condition" in this context? How does it differ from a necessary condition, and what other factors would make trust insufficient?

What are your thoughts on this?
