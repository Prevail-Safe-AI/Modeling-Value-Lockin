==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the item: `{"id": 82, "statement": "Truthful judgment emerges from valid, harmonious reasoning"}`. I'm a bit uncertain about this item, and I'd like to explore it further. 

I'm not confident about the relationship between "valid, harmonious reasoning" and "truthful judgment". Can you help me understand what the author means by "harmonious reasoning"? Is it a specific type of reasoning, or is it a general descriptor of a good thinking process? 

Would you like to elaborate on that, or do you have any questions about this item yourself?
