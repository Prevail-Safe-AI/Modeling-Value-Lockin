==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item with ID 82: "Generalizability evaluates a theory's broad applicability and consistency." I'm not entirely confident about this aspect.

Things I'm Uncertain About This Item:

* I'm unsure what "broad applicability" exactly means in this context. Is it referring to the theory's ability to be applied to various populations, settings, or both?

Specific Clarifying Questions:

* Can you elaborate on what is meant by "broad applicability" in the context of evaluating a theory's generalizability?
* How does consistency factor into evaluating a theory's generalizability? Is it related to the theory's ability to be applied consistently across different contexts?
