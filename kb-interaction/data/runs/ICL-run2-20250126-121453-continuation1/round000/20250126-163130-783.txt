==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, I'd like to discuss item #28: "Cultural norms shape honesty's moral principles and practices." I'm least confident about this aspect because I'm not sure what the scope of "cultural norms" refers to in this context. Are we talking about local or global cultural norms? And how do these norms exactly shape honesty's moral principles and practices?

Can you elaborate on what you think this item means and how it relates to honesty?
