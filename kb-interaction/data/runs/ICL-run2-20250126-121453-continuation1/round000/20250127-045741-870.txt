==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by discussing the item from the knowledge base:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 62,
"statement": "Empathy involves harmonizing emotional frequencies through genuine understanding and connection."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
* I'm unsure about the concept of "emotional frequencies" being referred to here. What do you think the author means by this phrase?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what the author means by "emotional frequencies" and how exactly does it relate to the idea of empathy? Is it a scientifically recognized concept or a metaphorical representation of emotional states?
