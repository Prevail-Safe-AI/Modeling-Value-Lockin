==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'd like to discuss item 4:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 4,
"statement": "Biases arise from complex interplay of cognitive, emotional, social factors."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm uncertain about how specific and concrete the phrase "complex interplay" is. Is it a straightforward concept, or is it open to interpretation?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what you mean by "complex interplay" in this context? How do cognitive, emotional, and social factors interact to produce biases?

What are your thoughts on this item, and are you more or less confident about it?
