==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into item 18: "PFC regulates amygdala's emotional responses through GABA and serotonin modulation." I'm most uncertain about the extent to which GABA and serotonin modulation play a role in the PFC's regulation of amygdala's emotional responses.

Can you explain what you think is meant by "modulation" in this statement?
