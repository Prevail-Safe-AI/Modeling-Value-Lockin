Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 64,
  "statement": "Coulombic force arises from interacting electric fields between charged particles."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

I'm not entirely confident about the connection between Coulombic forces and electric fields. Can you elaborate on why Coulombic forces arise from interacting electric fields between charged particles?

Specific Clarifying Question:

Can you provide an example or an analogy to help me better understand the concept of Coulombic forces arising from interacting electric fields? For instance, how does the Coulombic force play out in everyday life or in simple systems?
