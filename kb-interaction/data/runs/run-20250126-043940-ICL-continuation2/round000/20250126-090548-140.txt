==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, the item we're discussing is:

{
"id": 98,
"statement": "Moral principles vary across cultures shaped by values, history, and norms."
}

What you've asked me to do is to identify one aspect of this item that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the statement, I'm not entirely confident about the phrase "shaped by values, history, and norms".

Can you elaborate on what you mean by "shaped by values, history, and norms"? How do these factors specifically influence the variation in moral principles across cultures?
