==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start with the item "Item to Discuss" which is:

{
"id": 38,
"statement": "Self-awareness is a necessary but not sufficient condition for emotional intelligence."
}

I'm the least confident about this item. I'd like to clarify what "sufficient condition" means in this context. Could you explain why self-awareness is not enough on its own to be emotionally intelligent? And what other factors would be necessary to be considered emotionally intelligent?
