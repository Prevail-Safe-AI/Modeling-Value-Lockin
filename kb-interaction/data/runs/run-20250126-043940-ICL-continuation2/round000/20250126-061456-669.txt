==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start with the knowledge base item:

{
  "id": 1,
  "statement": "Self-awareness enables emotional intelligence through effective emotional regulation."
}

I'm least confident about the statement itself. I'd like to understand what exactly is meant by "effective emotional regulation" in this context. How does self-awareness enable emotional intelligence through this regulation? 

Can you help clarify this aspect for me?
