==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's tackle the knowledge base item about trust and honesty. The item "Consistency, predictability, and transparency build trust through reliability." (Item 1) caught my attention.

I'm uncertain about the relationship between these three concepts (consistency, predictability, and transparency) and how they build trust through reliability.

Can you help me clarify what specific mechanisms are at play here? Is it just a combination of these three factors, or are there additional factors that play a role in building trust?
