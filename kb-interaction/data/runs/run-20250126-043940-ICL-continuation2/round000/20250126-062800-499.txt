==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the knowledge base item: 

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 74,
  "statement": "Cognitive biases influence decision-making through mental shortcuts."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm least confident about how mental shortcuts specifically contribute to decision-making through cognitive biases.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what you mean by "mental shortcuts" in the context of cognitive biases influencing decision-making? How do these shortcuts lead to biased decisions?
