==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's analyze the knowledge base together.

I'd like to discuss the item:
```
{
  "id": 24,
  "statement": "Epigenetic inheritance involves DNA methylation, histone modifications, and inheritance."
}
```
What I'm uncertain about this item is: How does inheritance specifically play a role in epigenetic inheritance? I'm not sure what "inheritance" means in this context. Is it referring to the transmission of epigenetic marks from one generation to the next? Or is it something else entirely?

Can you help me clarify this uncertainty?
