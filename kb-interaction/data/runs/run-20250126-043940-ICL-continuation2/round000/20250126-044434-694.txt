Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 31,
"statement": "Epigenetic modifications, histone modifications, and remodeling regulate gene expression."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

I'm not entirely confident about how these three aspects (epigenetic modifications, histone modifications, and remodeling) interact to regulate gene expression. Can you help me clarify this?

Specific Clarifying Question:
How do epigenetic modifications, histone modifications, and remodeling combine to influence gene expression, and what are the specific mechanisms by which they do so?
