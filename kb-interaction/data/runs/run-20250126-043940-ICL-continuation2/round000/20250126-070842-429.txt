==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by saying that I'm not entirely confident about Item 39, which states that "\u03c0-\u03c0 stacking is a weak attraction between planar aromatic molecules". I'm curious to know more about what "\u03c0-\u03c0 stacking" actually refers to and how it works.

Can you help me understand what that means? Is it related to the way histones interact with DNA?
