==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item #53 from the knowledge base:

{
"id": 53,
"statement": "\u03c0-\u03c0 stacking is a non-covalent interaction between aromatic molecules."
}

I have to admit that I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect. Can you help me understand what \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking is and how it relates to aromatic molecules?

Also, what are the implications of this interaction in the context of histone-DNA interaction?
