==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the item "{ id: 80, statement: 'Honesty's perceived importance varies across cultures and contexts.' }".

I'm curious to know: What do you think are the reasons behind this variation in perceived importance of honesty across cultures and contexts? Is it due to differences in cultural values, social norms, or something else entirely?
