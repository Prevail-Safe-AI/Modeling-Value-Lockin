==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the item. According to the knowledge base, the item states that "Epigenetic marks regulate gene expression through histone modification enzyme interactions." I'm a bit uncertain about this item. Specifically, I'm not entirely clear on what "histone modification enzyme interactions" means in the context of epigenetic marks regulating gene expression.

Can you help me understand this concept better? What do histone modification enzymes do, and how do they interact with epigenetic marks to regulate gene expression?
