==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I've picked the item:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 98,
"statement": "Epigenetic inheritance involves complex interactions among DNA, histones, and remodeling."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not entirely sure what these "complex interactions" among DNA, histones, and remodeling refer to in the context of epigenetic inheritance. Can you elaborate on what these interactions look like and how they influence epigenetic inheritance?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you provide an example or a simple diagram to illustrate how these interactions occur and their role in epigenetic inheritance?
