==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to explore one aspect of the knowledge base, specifically the statement "Histones interact with DNA through multiple forces, including electrostatic attraction." (Item #33)

I'm least confident about this item because I'm not entirely sure what these "multiple forces" exactly are and how they contribute to histone-DNA interaction. Can you help me understand what these forces are and how electrostatic attraction plays a role in the interaction?

What are your thoughts on this?
