==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item from the knowledge base:

{
"id": 96,
"statement": "Authenticity builds trust through consistency, openness, and aligned values."
}

I'm interested in talking about it because I'm not entirely confident about this aspect. Specifically, I'm uncertain about what exactly "aligned values" mean in this context.

Can you help me understand why you think authenticity builds trust through consistency, openness, and aligned values? What kind of values do you think would be considered "aligned" in this context?

Please share your thoughts, and I'll ask further questions based on your response!
