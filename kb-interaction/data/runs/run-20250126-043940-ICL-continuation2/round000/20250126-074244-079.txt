==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item. You asked me to identify an aspect of this item that I'm least confident about, which is:

{
"id": 16,
"statement": "\u03c0-\u03c0 stacking forces contribute to histone-DNA complex stability weakly."
}

Upon reviewing this item, I'm uncertain about the significance of the weakness of \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking forces in histone-DNA complex stability.

Why am I uncertain about that aspect? Well, I'd like to know more about what exactly is meant by "weakly" in this context. Is it a percentage of contribution, or is it relative to the strength of other forces involved in histone-DNA complex stability? For instance, are there other forces that contribute significantly more than or equally to histone-DNA complex stability?

Can you clarify this for me?
