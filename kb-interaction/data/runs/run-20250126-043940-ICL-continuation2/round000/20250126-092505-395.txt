==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 81,
"statement": "Histone-DNA binding initiates with electrostatic zipper mechanism for chromatin assembly."
}

I'm not very confident about this aspect because I'm not clear about what an "electrostatic zipper mechanism" means in the context of histone-DNA binding and chromatin assembly. Can you elaborate on what this mechanism involves?
