==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm going to choose the item "Self-awareness develops through consistent intentional reflection and introspection" (id: 19) and discuss it.

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 19,
"statement": "Self-awareness develops through consistent intentional reflection and introspection."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

* I'm not sure how to define "intentional reflection". Is it simply thinking about your thoughts and emotions, or is it something more active and conscious?

Specific Clarifying Question:
What do you mean by "intentional reflection"? Can you give an example of how someone might practice intentional reflection effectively?
