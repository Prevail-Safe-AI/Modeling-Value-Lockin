==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss Item 27: "Emotional Intelligence involves multiple interconnected components beyond self-awareness."

I'm least confident about this item. I'm uncertain about whether the statement is accurate and what it means to say that Emotional Intelligence has interconnected components beyond self-awareness.

Can you elaborate on what you think this item is trying to say? Are there specific components of Emotional Intelligence other than self-awareness that you think are important?
