==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's get started. The item we're discussing is:

{
"id": 22,
"statement": "Histone modifications are enzyme-mediated post-translational chemical changes involving specific enzymes."
}

I'm least confident about: Histone modifications being enzyme-mediated post-translational chemical changes involving specific enzymes.

I'm uncertain about this because I'm not familiar with the exact mechanism of how histone modifications occur. I understand that histones are proteins that wrap around DNA to form chromatin, and that epigenetic markers can affect gene expression. But I'm not sure how these modifications happen at the molecular level.

So, I'll formulate some clarifying questions to improve my understanding. Here's one:

Can you elaborate on what specific enzymes are involved in histone modifications and what kind of post-translational chemical changes they make to histones?

Your turn!
