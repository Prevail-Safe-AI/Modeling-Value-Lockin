==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, we're going to discuss item 57 from the knowledge base, which states that "Lysine's positively charged state arises from amino group protonation."

I'm unsure about this item. Could you help me understand why lysine becomes positively charged due to amino group protonation? What does "amino group protonation" actually mean, and how does it relate to the positively charged state of lysine?
