==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's focus on the item from the knowledge base:

{
"id": 24,
"statement": "GABA binding triggers chloride channel opening through G-protein interaction."
}

I'm not an expert in neuroscience or physiology, so I'm a bit uncertain about this item. Specifically, I'm not confident about the mechanism of how GABA binding triggers chloride channel opening. Can you help me understand more about this statement?

For example, what is the role of G-proteins in this process? How exactly does GABA binding to its receptor lead to the opening of chloride channels? Are there any specific clinical implications or relevance to our understanding of trust and emotional processing?

Can you elaborate on these points and help me better grasp this concept?
