==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by discussing the item:

{
"id": 98,
"statement": "Stability encompasses dependable actions, emotions, and behaviors."
}

I'm least confident about this item. I'm unsure about what exactly is meant by "stability" in this context. Is it being used to refer to a person's emotional state, their habits, or something else entirely?

Can you help me understand this better?
