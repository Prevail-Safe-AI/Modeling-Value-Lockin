==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the knowledge base statement "Cognitive appraisal involves dynamic integration of PFC and amygdala regions." Specifically, I'm least confident about the part where it says "dynamic integration".

Can you elaborate on what you think "dynamic integration" means in this context? And how does it relate to the concept of cognitive appraisal?

Also, are there any potential implications or examples that come to mind when thinking about PFC and amygdala regions interacting in this way?
