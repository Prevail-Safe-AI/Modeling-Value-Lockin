==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll choose an item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. Let me select it... Ah, I chose item 43:

"{ id: 43, statement: 'Empathy and effective communication build trust in complex situations.' }"

I'm uncertain about this aspect because... (pause) ...I'm not sure what exactly makes "complex situations" complex, and how empathy and effective communication specifically help build trust in those situations.

Can you help me understand this better?
