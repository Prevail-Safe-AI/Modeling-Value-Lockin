==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss Item 79: "Histone modifications regulate chromatin structure and gene expression through specific mechanisms."

I'm least confident about the phrase "specific mechanisms". Can you elaborate on what is meant by "specific mechanisms"? Are these mechanisms described in the knowledge base? Or are they part of a broader category of mechanisms?

Also, what do you understand by the phrase "specific mechanisms" in the context of histone modifications, chromatin structure, and gene expression?
