==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into it. The item is:

{
"id": 10,
"statement": "Histones interact with DNA primarily through electrostatic forces."
}

I'm a bit uncertain about this item, specifically about whether the statement is accurate or not. I'm not confident in my understanding of how histones interact with DNA, and I'm curious to know more.

Can you help me clarify this point? What do you think about this statement? Is it accurate? Are there other forces involved in the interaction between histones and DNA?
