==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item from the knowledge base:

{
"id": 37,
"statement": "Moral decision-making involves context-dependent evaluation of consequences."
}

I'm a bit uncertain about this item. One thing that's unclear to me is the relationship between "context-dependent evaluation" and "consequences". I'm not sure what that means in the context of moral decision-making.

Can you help me understand this better?

Specifically, what does it mean to evaluate consequences in a context-dependent way? Is it saying that the same action can have different moral consequences depending on the situation?
