==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's talk about the knowledge base item I mentioned. I'm feeling uncertain about the aspect: "Empathy arises from dynamic interplay of cognitive, emotional, social factors."

Things I'm Uncertain About This Item:

* I'm not entirely sure what constitutes a "dynamic interplay" between these cognitive, emotional, and social factors. Does it mean that one factor affects another, or are these factors influencing each other in multiple ways?

Specific Clarifying Question:

* Can you provide an example of how these factors interact with each other to form empathy? For instance, how does cognitive understanding of someone's perspective intersect with emotional resonance and social norms?

What are your thoughts on this item?
