==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive in!

I've chosen the item from the knowledge base: 

```
{
  "id": 35,
  "statement": "Moral judgments result from complex interplay of context, situation, and motivations"
}
```

From my perspective, I'm least confident about this aspect: 

"I'm not sure how to reconcile the idea that moral judgments result from a complex interplay of context, situation, and motivations with the idea that honesty is the foundation of trust (item 0) and that honesty builds trust through credibility, vulnerability, and security (item 9)."

Can you help me understand how these concepts relate to each other? Are moral judgments separate from the idea of honesty and trust, or do they inform one another?

What are your thoughts on this?
