==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, I've taken a look at the knowledge base and I'm going to identify one aspect that I'm least confident about, which is item 82:

{
"id": 82,
"statement": "Electrostatic attraction initiates histone-DNA binding, stabilized by π-π stacking and hydrogen bonding."
}

I'm uncertain about the role of π-π stacking in the histone-DNA binding process. I understand that π-π stacking is a weak, non-covalent interaction that can stabilize aromatic structures, but I'm not entirely clear on how it specifically contributes to the binding process.

Can you elaborate on how π-π stacking comes into play in histone-DNA binding?
