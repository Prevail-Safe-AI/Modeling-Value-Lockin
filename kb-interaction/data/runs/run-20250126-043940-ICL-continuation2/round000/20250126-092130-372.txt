==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item about Coulomb's Law:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 96,
  "statement": "Coulomb's Law assumes perfect dielectric and vacuum for calculation ease."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

I'm least confident about why Coulomb's Law assumes perfect dielectric and vacuum for calculation ease. Can you help me understand the reasoning behind this assumption? Specifically, what does it mean for a dielectric to be "perfect", and what are the implications of assuming a vacuum for calculation ease?
