==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item we're discussing: ``{ "id": 82, "statement": "Pi-pi stacking is a weak attraction due to π-orbital overlap strength." }``

I'm a bit uncertain about the statement. Can you help me understand what's meant by "π-orbital overlap strength" in the context of pi-pi stacking? And why is it responsible for making the attraction weak?
