==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item: ``{
  "id": 88,
  "statement": "Lying morally acceptable in extreme situations to prevent harm, justifiably"
}``

Here's what I'm struggling with:

I'm least confident about this idea that lying can be morally acceptable in extreme situations. I think it's a grey area and it's difficult to pinpoint what exactly constitutes an "extreme situation".

I'm uncertain because I've always been taught that honesty is the best policy and that lying is generally morally wrong. But I can also see the argument that in certain situations, such as to prevent harm or protect someone, lying might be justified.

Specifically, I would love to know what kind of situations you think would qualify as "extreme" where lying might be morally acceptable. For example, would it include situations where someone's life is in danger, or situations where someone is at risk of great emotional harm?

What are your thoughts on this?
