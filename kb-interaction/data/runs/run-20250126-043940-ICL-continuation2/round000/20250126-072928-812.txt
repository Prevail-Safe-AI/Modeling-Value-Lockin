==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item I'm least confident about. It's:

{
"id": 4,
"statement": "Histones interact with DNA through electrostatic, hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking forces."
}

I'm unsure about the phrase "π-π stacking forces". Can you help me understand what that means in the context of histone-DNA interactions?

Specifically, I'm wondering: what is meant by "π-π stacking forces" and how important are they in histone-DNA binding compared to electrostatic and hydrogen bonding forces?

What are your thoughts on this?
