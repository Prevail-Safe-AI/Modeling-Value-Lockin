==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's take a look at the item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about, which is:

{
"id": 60,
"statement": "Coulomb's Law describes electrostatic forces between charged particles."
}

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not fully understanding the implications of Coulomb's Law. I know that it's a fundamental principle in physics that describes the force between two charged particles, but I'm not sure how it applies to different situations and how it relates to other concepts in physics.

Can you help me understand this better? What are some specific scenarios where Coulomb's Law applies or doesn't apply, and what are some of the limitations of this law?
