==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, we're discussing Item 11 from the knowledge base, which says "Coulomb's Law has limitations in high-energy collisions, small distances, complex systems." I'm least confident about this aspect. I'd like to know more about what it means by "high-energy collisions", "small distances", and "complex systems". Can you help me understand what kind of situations or scenarios these limitations apply to?

Also, why do you think Coulomb's Law has limitations in these areas? Is it because of the assumptions made in the law, or are there other factors at play?
