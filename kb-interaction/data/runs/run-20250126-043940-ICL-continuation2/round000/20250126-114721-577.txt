==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive in! I'll start by saying that I'm least confident about the item:

{
"id": 98,
"statement": "Moral judgments arise from the complex interplay of factors."
}

I'm uncertain about this item because I'm not entirely clear on what the author means by "complex interplay of factors." Are they referring to specific emotions, cultural norms, personal values, or something else? Or is it a mix of all these things?

Can you help me clarify what you think the author means by this statement?
