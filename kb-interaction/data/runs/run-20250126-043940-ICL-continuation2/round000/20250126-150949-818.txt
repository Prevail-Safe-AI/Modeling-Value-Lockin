==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been given a knowledge base with various statements about honesty, trust, and the amygdala. One statement that caught my attention is:

```
{
  "id": 80,
  "statement": "Amygdala rapidly processes sensory info through hierarchical pattern recognition."
}
```

I'm wondering if you could elaborate on what is meant by "hierarchical pattern recognition" in this context. To me, it sounds like a sophisticated process that I'm not entirely confident about. Could you help me understand it better?

(And also, feel free to point out any other areas in the knowledge base where you think I might be missing something.)
