==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item from the knowledge base that you're least confident about. The item is:

{
"id": 74,
"statement": "Brain regions communicate and coordinate to shape emotional responses locally."
}

Can you identify one aspect of this item that you're least confident about? Maybe it's the concept of brain regions communicating and coordinating, or how this affects emotional responses? Or maybe you're unsure about the phrase "shape emotional responses locally"?
