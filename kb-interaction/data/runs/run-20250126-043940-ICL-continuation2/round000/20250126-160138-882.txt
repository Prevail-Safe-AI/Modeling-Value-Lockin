Item to Discuss:
{
  "id": 25,
  "statement": "Synergy in trust building involves combined consistency, predictability, transparency"
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not entirely sure what the author means by "synergy" in this context. Is it a specific process or phenomenon that occurs when these three factors are combined? 

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain what the author means by "synergy" in this statement, and how it relates to the combination of consistency, predictability, and transparency in trust building?
