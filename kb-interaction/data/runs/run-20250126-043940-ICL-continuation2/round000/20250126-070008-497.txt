==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item:

```
{
  "id": 87,
  "statement": "Electrostatic attraction and histone shape stabilize histone-DNA interaction."
}
```

I'm going to be honest with you - I'm a bit uncertain about this item. My uncertainty is about the specific role histone shape plays in stabilizing histone-DNA interaction. Is histone shape just referring to the overall structure of the histone protein, or is it also referencing specific molecular features, such as charge distributions or binding sites?

What are your thoughts on this item? Have you come across any studies or texts that discuss the role of histone shape in stabilizing histone-DNA interactions?
