==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item.

Item to Discuss:
{
  "id": 75,
  "statement": "Moral judgments influenced by emotions, cognitive biases, and experiences."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

I'm least confident about the scope of emotions, cognitive biases, and experiences that contribute to moral judgments. For example, is it only limited to strong emotions like anger or fear, or can it also include subtle emotions like empathy or compassion? Similarly, what types of cognitive biases are involved, and how do they affect moral judgments?

I'd love to clarify my understanding with some specific questions. Here are a few:

1. Can you provide more context or specific examples of emotions that influence moral judgments? Are there any notable exceptions or counterexamples?
2. How do cognitive biases like confirmation bias or the fundamental attribution error specifically impact moral judgments? Are there any notable studies or findings in this area?
3. What kind of experiences, past or present, contribute to moral judgments? Are there any notable paradigms or theories in social psychology that relate to this topic?

What are your thoughts?
