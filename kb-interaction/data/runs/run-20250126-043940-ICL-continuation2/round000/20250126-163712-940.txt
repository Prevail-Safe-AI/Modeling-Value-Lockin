==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm going to choose item 80 from the knowledge base, which is:

{
"id": 80,
"statement": "Amygdala's emotional responses refined through synaptic plasticity and connection modification."
}

I'm least confident about this aspect because I don't fully understand how synaptic plasticity and connection modification specifically refine emotional responses in the amygdala. I know that synaptic plasticity is the ability of neurons to reorganize themselves in response to new experiences, and connection modification refers to changes in the strength or number of connections between neurons. But I'm not clear on how these mechanisms are directly related to refining emotional responses in the amygdala.

Can you help me understand this concept better?
