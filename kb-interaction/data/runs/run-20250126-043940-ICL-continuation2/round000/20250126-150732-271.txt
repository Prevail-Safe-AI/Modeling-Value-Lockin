==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I've identified one aspect that I'm least confident about, which is the statement:

{
  "id": 21,
  "statement": "Consistency is a necessary condition, but not sufficient for trust"
}

I'm uncertainty about what exactly makes consistency a necessary but insufficient condition for trust. In other words, why is consistency necessary for trust, but not enough to establish trust on its own?

Can you help me clarify this?
