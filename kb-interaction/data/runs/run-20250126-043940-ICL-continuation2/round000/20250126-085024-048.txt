==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 97 from the knowledge base. It states that "Histone-DNA binding involves multiple forces, electrostatic attraction being primary".

I'm least confident about the aspect that electrostatic attraction is the primary force in histone-DNA binding. I'm unsure if it's the most dominant force or if other forces play a crucial role as well.

Can you elaborate on why you think electrostatic attraction is primary, or if you have any reservations about this statement?
