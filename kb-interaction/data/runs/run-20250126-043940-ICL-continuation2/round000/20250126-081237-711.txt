==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item. The item we're discussing is:

{
"id": 42,
"statement": "Coulombic forces are always attractive or repulsive, never both."
}

From this statement, I'm least confident about the claim that Coulombic forces are always attractive or repulsive, never both. I'm wondering if this statement is correct, and if there are any situations or exceptions where Coulombic forces might be both attractive and repulsive at the same time.

What do you think about this statement? Do you have any insights or expertise that could help clarify this concept?
