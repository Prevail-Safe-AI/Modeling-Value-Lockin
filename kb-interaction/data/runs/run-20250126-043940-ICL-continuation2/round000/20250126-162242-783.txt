==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 15 from the knowledge base.

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 15,
  "statement": "Amygdala rapidly processes sensory info for motor responses in milliseconds."
}
```

Things I'm Uncertain About This Item:

* I'm not confident about the exact timeframe of "milliseconds" being mentioned in the statement. What does "milliseconds" refer to in this context?

Specific Clarifying Question:
What does "milliseconds" mean in this statement, and how does the amygdala process sensory information that quickly?
