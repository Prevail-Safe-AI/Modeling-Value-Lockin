==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, we're discussing item 36 from the knowledge base:

{
"id": 36,
"statement": "Amygdala's automatic emotional responses influence moral judgments unconsciously."
}

I'm a bit uncertain about this item. Specifically, I'm wondering how the amygdala's automatic emotional responses can influence moral judgments unconsciously. Can we break it down further?

For instance, what does "automatic emotional responses" mean in this context? Are we talking about emotional responses that are triggered without us even realizing it, or is it more about emotional responses that are linked to certain stimuli or environments?

Also, what do you mean by "influence moral judgments unconsciously"? Are we talking about a direct link between the amygdala and our moral judgments, or is it more of a indirect influence, perhaps through other brain regions or cognitive processes?

Can we clarify these points further?
