==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into item 92: "Lying can be morally justified in certain situations". This statement seems quite interesting, and I'm a bit uncertain about it.

I'm not confident about this aspect because I've always been taught that honesty is the best policy, and lying is generally considered morally wrong. However, the statement suggests that there might be certain situations where lying could be justified.

Can you help me understand what kind of situations you think would make lying morally justifiable? For example, would it be in cases of self-defense, deception to protect someone, or something entirely different?

Specifically, I'd like to know: 

Clarifying Question: Can you give an example of a situation where lying could be morally justified?
