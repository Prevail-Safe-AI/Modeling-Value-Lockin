==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'd like to explore item number 73, which states "Post-translational histone modifications regulate chromatin structure and gene expression patterns."

Initially, I'm not very confident about this aspect. I'm unsure about the specifics of how post-translational histone modifications regulate chromatin structure and gene expression patterns.

Could you elaborate on why you think post-translational histone modifications have this effect? What are some examples of post-translational histone modifications and how do they impact chromatin structure and gene expression?

Also, could you provide some clarification on what is meant by "chromatin structure" and "gene expression patterns"?

I'd appreciate any insights you have on this topic!
