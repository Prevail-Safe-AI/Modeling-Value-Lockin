==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item I've identified:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 81,
  "statement": "Emotions, empathy, and social context influence moral decision-making processes."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not entirely clear on how emotions, empathy, and social context interact with each other in moral decision-making processes. 

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on the relationship between these three components? Do emotions have a primary influence, or do they work together in a more complex way?

Your thoughts?
