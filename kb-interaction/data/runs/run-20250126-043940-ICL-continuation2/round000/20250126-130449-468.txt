==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the item: { "id": 49, "statement": "Emotions influence moral judgments through automatic, outside of conscious awareness." }. I'm a bit uncertain about this item.

Things I'm Uncertain About This Item:

* I'm not entirely sure how emotions can influence moral judgments outside of conscious awareness. Can we consider the role of rational thinking in moral decision-making? Do emotions always play a role, even when we're not consciously aware of them?

Specific Clarifying Question:

* Can you provide some examples of situations where emotions might influence moral judgments without conscious awareness? For instance, are we talking about situations of deep emotional attachment or perhaps unconscious biases?

Your thoughts?
