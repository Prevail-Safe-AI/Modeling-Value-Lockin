Let's dive into the item:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 37,
  "statement": "Post-translational histone modifications regulate chromatin structure and gene expression."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

I'm least confident about how post-translational histone modifications specifically regulate chromatin structure and gene expression. Can you elaborate on what you understand about this process?

What types of post-translational modifications are involved in regulating chromatin structure and gene expression? And how do these modifications ultimately affect the expression of genes?
