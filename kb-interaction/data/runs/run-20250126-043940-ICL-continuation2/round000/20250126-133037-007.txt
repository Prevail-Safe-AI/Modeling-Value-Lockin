==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd love to discuss the statement "Unconscious emotional associations influence moral judgments through complex mechanisms." (Item 73).

I'm a bit uncertain about this item, and I'd like to know more about it. What do you think about this concept? Do you think it's accurate that our unconscious emotional associations can affect our moral judgments in complex ways?

Please share your thoughts, and I'll elaborate on my own concerns and questions.
