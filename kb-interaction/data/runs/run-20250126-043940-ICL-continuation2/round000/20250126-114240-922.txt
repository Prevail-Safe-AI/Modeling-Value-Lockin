==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 63: "Honesty's interpretation varies across cultures shaped by values."

I'm least confident about this aspect because I'm not entirely sure what it means for something like honesty to be "shaped by values". Is it suggesting that values directly influence people's understanding of honesty? Or is it saying that values shape the context in which people apply their understanding of honesty? I'd love some clarification on this.

Can you help me out and elaborate on why you think honesty's interpretation varies across cultures shaped by values?
