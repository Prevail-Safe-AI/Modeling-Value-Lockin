==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by saying that I'm tasked with discussing one aspect of the knowledge base, specifically item 43: "Amygdala processes emotional stimuli outside conscious awareness swiftly."

I'm least confident about the speed at which the amygdala processes emotional stimuli outside conscious awareness. I'd like to understand more about what "swiftly" means in this context. Is it measured in milliseconds? Is it a specific time frame?

Can you help me elaborate on why I'm uncertain about this aspect?
