==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I've picked an item that I'm least confident about, which is:

```
{
  "id": 38,
  "statement": "Hydrophobic forces indirectly stabilize histone-DNA interaction through water exclusion."
}
```

I'm not entirely sure how hydrophobic forces, which are typically associated with non-covalent interactions between non-polar molecules, can indirectly stabilize the histone-DNA interaction through water exclusion.

Can you help me understand this concept better? What's the underlying mechanism behind this statement?
