==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the topic. I've chosen an item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about, and it is:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 98,
  "statement": "Consistency and reliability build trust through predictability."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm unsure about how exactly "predictability" contributes to building trust. Is it because people can rely on consistent behavior and outcomes? Or is it something deeper?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand how "predictability" plays a role in building trust, beyond just consistency and reliability?

What are your thoughts on this?
