==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'll choose an item that caught my attention.

Item to Discuss:

{
"id": 76,
"statement": "Moral decision-making involves complex contextual and consequence consideration."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

Honestly, I'm unsure about the scope of "complex contextual and consequence consideration" in moral decision-making. It seems like a high-level statement, but I'd love to understand what specific factors or considerations are involved.

Specific Clarifying Question:

Can you explain what you mean by "complex contextual and consequence consideration" in the context of moral decision-making? Are there any specific examples or scenarios where this concept plays a crucial role?
