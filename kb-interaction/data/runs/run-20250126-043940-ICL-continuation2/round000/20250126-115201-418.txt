==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying an aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the information, I'm most uncertain about this item:

{
"id": 29,
"statement": "Objectivity in empathy achieved through self-awareness and imaginative understanding"
}

I'm unsure about this aspect because I'm not entirely clear on how self-awareness and imaginative understanding can combine to achieve objectivity in empathy. Can you help me understand this better?
