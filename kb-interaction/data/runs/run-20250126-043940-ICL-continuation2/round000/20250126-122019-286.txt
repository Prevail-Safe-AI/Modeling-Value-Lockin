==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's discuss the knowledge base item I've selected: "{id: 39, statement: 'Empathy arises from complex interplay of cognitive, social, and emotional factors.'".

I'm least confident about the complexity of the interplay between cognitive, social, and emotional factors. I'd love to understand more about how these factors interact and influence empathy.

Can you help me elaborate on this uncertainty?

What aspects of the interplay do you think are the most significant or difficult to understand?
