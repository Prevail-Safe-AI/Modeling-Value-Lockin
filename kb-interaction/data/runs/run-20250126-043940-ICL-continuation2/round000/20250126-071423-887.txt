==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item: `{ "id": 91, "statement": "Wording nuances convey sincerity, empathy, and understanding in trust-building messages." }`.

I'm least confident about this item because I'm not entirely sure how wording nuances specifically contribute to sincerity, empathy, and understanding in trust-building messages. Can you help me understand what you mean by "wording nuances"?

In other words, what specific aspects of word choice, sentence structure, or tone of voice are you referring to when you say "wording nuances"?
