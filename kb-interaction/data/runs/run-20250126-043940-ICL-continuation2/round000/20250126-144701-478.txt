==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, I was tasked to identify one aspect of this knowledge base I'm least confident about, and I chose statement 87: "GABA's inhibitory effects help regulate neural activity and emotions". 

I'm uncertain about this item because I'm not entirely clear on how GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid) specifically helps regulate neural activity and emotions. What do you know about GABA's role in regulating emotions and neural activity?
