==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item: ```

{
  "id": 63,
  "statement": "Amygdala's automatic processing triggers emotional response outside awareness."
}
```

I'm least confident about this aspect: Amygdala's automatic processing. I'm not sure how well I understand the concept of "automatic processing" and how it relates to the amygdala's emotional response.

Can you help me elaborate on what this means and why you're uncertain about that aspect?
