==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, I've been asked to identify one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the item, I've decided to choose:

{
"id": 68,
"statement": "Cognitive biases and emotional influences impact judgment and decision-making."
}

Specifically, I'm unsure about the relationship between cognitive biases and emotional influences. I understand that cognitive biases are mental shortcuts that can lead to incorrect or inaccurate thinking, but I'm not clear on how emotional influences come into play. Are they separate entities, or do they interact in some way?

Can you help me clarify this?
