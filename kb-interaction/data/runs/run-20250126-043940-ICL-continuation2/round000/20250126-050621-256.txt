==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into it. I've chosen item #60 as the one I'm least confident about. It says: "Histone modifications regulate chromatin structure through enzyme-mediated PTMs."

I'm uncertain about how histone modifications specifically regulate chromatin structure. Could you elaborate on what enzyme-mediated PTMs are and how they relate to histone modifications and chromatin structure?
