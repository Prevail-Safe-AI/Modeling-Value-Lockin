==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item: 

{
"id": 54,
"statement": "Epigenetic changes can coincide with DNA sequence mutations in cancer."
}

I'm least confident about this item. I'm unsure about the relationship between epigenetic changes and DNA sequence mutations in cancer. 

Can you elaborate on why epigenetic changes can coincide with DNA sequence mutations in cancer? What implications does this have for our understanding of cancer development and treatment?
