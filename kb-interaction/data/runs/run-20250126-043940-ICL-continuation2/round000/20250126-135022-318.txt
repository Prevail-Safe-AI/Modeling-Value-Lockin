==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. According to the item:

{
"id": 45,
"statement": "Moral development emerges from reciprocal biological-cultural interactions."
}

I'm not confident about the aspect that says "reciprocal biological-cultural interactions". What I'm unsure about is how these interactions are supposed to be reciprocal. I'd love to gain a deeper understanding of what this exactly means.

Can you help me clarify that?
