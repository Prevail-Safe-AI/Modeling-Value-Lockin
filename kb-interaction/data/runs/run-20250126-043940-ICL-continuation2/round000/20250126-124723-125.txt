==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by saying that I'm going to choose the item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about, which is:

{
"id": 2,
"statement": "Moral development influenced by biological, cultural, and social factors."
}

I'm uncertain about this item because I'm not clear on how all these factors interact with each other. I know that it's commonly discussed that moral development is influenced by a combination of biological, cultural, and social factors, but I'm not sure how these factors shape moral development in different individuals and cultures.

For example, does biological development refer to innate moral principles or something else? How do cultural factors shape moral development, and are there any specific cultural practices or values that influence this process? And what exactly do we mean by social factors, and how do they impact moral development?

Can you help me clarify these points and provide some insights on how these factors interact with each other to shape moral development?
