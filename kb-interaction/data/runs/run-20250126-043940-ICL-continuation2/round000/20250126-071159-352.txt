==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item: 

{
"id": 3,
"statement": "Histones interact with DNA through multiple forces, stabilizing chromatin."
}

I'm not entirely confident about this aspect of the item. The statement mentions multiple forces, but it doesn't specify what those forces are. Can you elaborate on what kinds of forces are involved in the interaction between histones and DNA?
