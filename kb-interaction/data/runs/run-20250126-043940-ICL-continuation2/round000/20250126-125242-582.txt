==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the discussion. I've been assigned to identify one aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about, and the item I've chosen is:

{
"id": 31,
"statement": "Cultural norms shape emotional expressions through complex social interactions."
}

I'm uncertain about the concept of "complex social interactions" in this statement. Can you help me understand what's meant by that? How do we define "complex" social interactions, and what specific mechanisms or processes are involved in shaping emotional expressions through these interactions?

What's your take on this?
