==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you! I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 98,
"statement": "Subcortical structure processes emotional stimuli rapidly through direct connections."
}

I'm least confident about this aspect: the rapidly processing of emotional stimuli through direct connections. Can you elaborate on why you think this is the case?

(Also, feel free to ask me any questions you'd like in return!)
