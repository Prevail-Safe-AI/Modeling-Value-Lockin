==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the knowledge base item #27. As I read it, I am least confident about this statement: "Authenticity is a necessary condition for trust-building, but not sufficient alone."

I'm unsure about this because I'm not clear on what the authors mean by "necessary condition." Is it that authenticity is always required in some way for trust-building to happen, or is it that it's a prerequisite in certain situations? And what do they mean by "not sufficient alone"? Is it that authenticity alone is not enough to build trust, but it needs to be combined with other factors?

Can you help me clarify these points?
