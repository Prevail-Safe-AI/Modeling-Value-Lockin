==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 21,
  "statement": "GABA and serotonin inhibit amygdala's emotional responses through postsynaptic inhibition."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm uncertain about the role of GABA and serotonin in inhibiting the amygdala's emotional responses. I'm not confident about how exactly postsynaptic inhibition occurs and how it affects emotional processing.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain in more detail what is meant by "postsynaptic inhibition" and how GABA and serotonin are involved in this process? How does this inhibition affect the amygdala's emotional responses?
