==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's focus on item 71: "Cultural norms shape empathy through values, communication, and norms." I'd like to discuss this item, specifically I'm least confident about the role of values in shaping empathy.

I'm uncertain about how values contribute to shaping empathy, as the statement seems to imply that cultural norms shape empathy through values, norms, and communication. But what kind of values are we talking about? Are they moral values, cultural values, or something else entirely? How do these values influence empathy development?

Can you help clarify this for me?
