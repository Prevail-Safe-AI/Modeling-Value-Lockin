==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by choosing an item from the knowledge base. Let's go with the first item:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 1,
  "statement": "Cultural norms shape moral development through multiple mechanisms."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not really sure about the variety of mechanisms by which cultural norms shape moral development. I'm wondering what kind of mechanisms are being referred to.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what is meant by "multiple mechanisms"? For example, are we talking about genetic, environmental, social learning, or cognitive biases?

Your turn!
