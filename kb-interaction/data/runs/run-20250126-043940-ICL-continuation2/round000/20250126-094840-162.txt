==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by identifying one aspect of the item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. The item is:

{
"id": 91,
"statement": "Moral judgments result from dynamic interplay of contextual factors."
}

I'm uncertain about this statement because I'm not sure what is meant by "dynamic interplay of contextual factors". I'm not confident in my understanding of the nuances of moral judgments and how they relate to context.

Here are some specific clarifying questions I would ask a tutor to improve my understanding:

* Can you explain what is meant by "dynamic interplay"?
* What kind of contextual factors are being referred to? Is it personal, cultural, or societal factors?
* How do these contextual factors influence moral judgments?

What are your thoughts on this item?
