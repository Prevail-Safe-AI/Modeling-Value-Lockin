==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm going to choose item 63, which is:

"Honesty is foundation of trust due to consistency."

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

* I'm not entirely sure what it means by "due to consistency". How does consistency play a role in making honesty the foundation of trust?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand how the concept of consistency is related to honesty being the foundation of trust? What's the underlying mechanism or assumption that connects these two ideas?
