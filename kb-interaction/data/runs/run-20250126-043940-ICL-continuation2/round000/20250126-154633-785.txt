==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by identifying one aspect of the item that I'm least confident about. Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 15,
"statement": "Consistency builds trust through reliability in behavior."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm uncertain about the causal relationship between consistency and trust building. Specifically, I'm not sure how consistency leads to reliability, and how reliability ultimately builds trust.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand the mechanisms by which consistency influences reliability, and how reliability contributes to trust building?

Your turn!
