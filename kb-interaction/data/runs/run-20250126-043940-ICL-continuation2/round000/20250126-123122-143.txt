==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been asked to identify one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about, and then elaborate on why I'm uncertain about it, and finally, formulate specific clarifying questions to ask a tutor to improve my understanding.

The item is: ```
{
  "id": 99,
  "statement": "Cognitive appraisal integrates rationality and emotion in moral judgment process"
}
```

After reviewing the item, I'm least confident about the concept of "cognitive appraisal" in the moral judgment process. I'm not sure what is meant by "cognitive appraisal" and how it integrates rationality and emotion in moral judgment.

Can you help me understand what "cognitive appraisal" refers to in this context?
