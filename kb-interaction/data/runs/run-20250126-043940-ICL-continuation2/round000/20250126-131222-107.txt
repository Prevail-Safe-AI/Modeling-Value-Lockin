==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, we're looking at the knowledge base and I want to discuss one aspect that I'm least confident about. I've chosen item 28: "Moral development emerges from dynamic interactions between values and experiences." 

Things I'm Uncertain About This Item:

* I'm not sure how to define "dynamic interactions" in this context. Is it referring to a specific type of interaction between values and experiences, or is it a general concept?

Specific Clarifying Question:

* Can you explain what specifically is meant by "dynamic interactions" between values and experiences? For example, are we talking about a conversation or a series of events that lead to personal growth? 

What are your thoughts on this item?
