==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 18:

{
"id": 18,
"statement": "Amygdala's multiple roles in emotional processing and regulation"
}

I'm least confident about this item because I'm not entirely sure what the amygdala's multiple roles are. This statement mentions "emotional processing and regulation", but I'm not clear about how the amygdala plays a role in these processes.

Can you help me understand what the amygdala does in these contexts?
