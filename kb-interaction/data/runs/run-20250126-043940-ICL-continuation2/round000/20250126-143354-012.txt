==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item "Moral development arises from cognitive, emotional, and social interactions."

I'm a bit uncertain about this item, so let's dive deeper. I'd like to know what makes you think moral development comes from these three aspects. What specific examples or evidence can be cited to support this notion?

Can you help me clarify my understanding?
