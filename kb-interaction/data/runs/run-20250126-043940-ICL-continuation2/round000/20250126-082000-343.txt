==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 92, which states "Epigenetic marks occur on histones, non-coding RNAs, and proteins."

I'm least confident about this aspect because, in my understanding, epigenetic marks typically refer to chemical modifications that occur on DNA or histones, which are the main components of chromatin. While non-coding RNAs do play a role in regulating gene expression, I'm not sure how they would be considered epigenetic marks.

Can you clarify why non-coding RNAs are mentioned as a location for epigenetic marks? How do the modifications on non-coding RNAs affect gene expression or chromatin structure?

(Let me know if I'm on the right track or not!)
