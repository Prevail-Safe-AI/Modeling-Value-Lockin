==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the knowledge base item I'm supposed to discuss. I've been asked to identify one aspect of the item I'm least confident about. After reviewing the item:

{
"id": 47,
"statement": "Histone modifications regulate chromatin structure and gene expression patterns."
}

I've identified that I'm least confident about the statement "Histone modifications regulate chromatin structure and gene expression patterns."

I'm uncertain about this item because I'm not clear on how histone modifications actually regulate chromatin structure and gene expression patterns. I mean, I understand that histones are proteins that DNA wraps around, and that modifications can be made to the histones, but I'm not sure how these modifications impact chromatin structure and gene expression.

Can you help me clarify this?
