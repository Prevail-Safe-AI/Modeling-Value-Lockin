==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's analyze the statement "Dependability requires adaptability, consistency, and intelligent flexibility in all situations." I'll start by saying that I'm not very confident about this aspect. 

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I’m unsure about what "intelligent flexibility" means in this context. Is it a specific skill or trait that one can develop, or is it a combination of adaptability and consistency?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you please explain what you mean by "intelligent flexibility" in the context of dependability, and how it differs from adaptability and consistency?

Your thoughts?
