==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item.

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 98,
  "statement": "GABA calms amygdala neurons by hyperpolarizing chloride channels effectively."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not entirely confident about the exact mechanism of how GABA calms amygdala neurons by hyperpolarizing chloride channels. I'd like to understand the physiological process better.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain how GABA's hyperpolarization of chloride channels leads to a calming effect on amygdala neurons? Is it a direct or indirect mechanism, and what are the key players involved in this process?

What are your thoughts?
