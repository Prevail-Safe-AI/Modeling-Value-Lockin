Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'd like to discuss the item from the knowledge base: `{ "id": 55, "statement": "Emotional Intelligence involves practical application of recognition and understanding." }`.

Can you tell me what you're least confident about this item?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

After reviewing the item, I'd say that I'm least confident about the phrase "practical application". While emotional intelligence does involve recognizing and understanding emotions, the concept of "practical application" might be a bit vague.

In the context of emotional intelligence, "practical application" could mean different things to different people. For example, it might refer to using emotional intelligence in daily life, such as managing stress or building stronger relationships. Alternatively, it could mean applying emotional intelligence in a professional setting, such as in leadership or customer service.

Without more context or clarification, it's difficult to pinpoint exactly what "practical application" means in this statement.
