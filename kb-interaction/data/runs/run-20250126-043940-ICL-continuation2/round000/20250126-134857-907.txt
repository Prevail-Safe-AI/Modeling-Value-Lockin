==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've identified an item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about, which is:

{
"id": 59,
"statement": "Moral development emerges from dynamic biological-cultural interdependencies."
}

I'm unsure about this aspect because it seems to be stating that moral development is a combination of both biological and cultural factors, which is a complex and multi-faceted concept. I'd like to understand more about what specifically are these "dynamic biological-cultural interdependencies" and how they influence moral development.

Can you help me clarify this concept and provide more context or details?
