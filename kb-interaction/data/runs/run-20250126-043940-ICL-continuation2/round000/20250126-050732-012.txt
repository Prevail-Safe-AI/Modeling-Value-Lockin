==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 43: "Histones undergo demethylation by LSD1 and JHDM enzymes." I'm not very confident about this aspect of epigenetic modifications. 

I'm unsure about what LSD1 and JHDM enzymes are specifically, and what their role is in demethylating histones?

Can you help me understand this better?
