==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. The item is:

{
"id": 53,
"statement": "Self-awareness involves recognizing biases in thoughts and decision-making processes."
}

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not entirely sure what it means to "recognize biases in thoughts and decision-making processes". What does it mean to recognize biases in this sense? Is it just being aware of our own biases or is it actively correcting them? How do we recognize biases in our thoughts and decision-making processes? 

Specifically, I have questions such as:

* What are some common types of biases that we should be aware of in our thoughts and decision-making processes?
* How do we identify biases in our own thinking and decision-making?
* What strategies can we use to overcome biases in our thinking and decision-making?

Can you help me understand this aspect better?
