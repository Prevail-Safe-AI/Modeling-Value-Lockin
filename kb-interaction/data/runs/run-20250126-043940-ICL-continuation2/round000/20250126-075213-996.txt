==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm going to start by saying that I'm least confident about the item:

{
"id": 7,
"statement": "Moral principles can vary across cultural, social, and personal contexts."
}

I'm uncertain about this item because I'm not entirely sure what it means by "moral principles". Are moral principles a fixed set of rules, or are they more flexible and context-dependent? Additionally, I'm not sure how to apply this concept in real-life situations. For example, if someone's moral principle is to always tell the truth, but in a certain cultural context it's considered impolite to directly disagree with someone, what would you do in that situation?

Can you help me clarify this concept?
