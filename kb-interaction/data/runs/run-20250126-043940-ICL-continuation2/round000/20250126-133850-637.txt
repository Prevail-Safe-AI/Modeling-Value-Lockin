==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

```
{
  "id": 27,
  "statement": "Repetitive feedback loops shape emotional responses through social learning processes."
}
```

I'm least confident about this item because I'm not entirely sure what repetitive feedback loops are or how they shape emotional responses. Could you elaborate on what you understand by repetitive feedback loops in the context of emotional responses?

Also, what do you mean by "social learning processes"? In what ways do these processes influence emotional responses?

These questions are specific clarifying questions I would ask a tutor to improve my understanding of this item.
