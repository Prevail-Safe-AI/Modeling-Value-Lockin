==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the statement "Histone-DNA binding initiated by electrostatic attraction and charge complementarity." I'm least confident about this item. 

I'm uncertain about how electrostatic attraction and charge complementarity specifically work together to initiate histone-DNA binding. From what I understand, electrostatic attraction is the attractive force between oppositely charged particles, but what is charge complementarity in this context? How do these two forces complement each other to initiate the binding process?

Can you help clarify this for me?
