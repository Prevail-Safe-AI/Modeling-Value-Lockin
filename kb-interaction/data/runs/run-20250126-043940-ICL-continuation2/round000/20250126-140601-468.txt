==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been going through the knowledge base, and I came across statement 52: "Rapid cue integration enables social learning of emotional responses". I have to admit, I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect.

What I'm unsure about is how exactly "rapid cue integration" enables social learning of emotional responses. Can you help me understand what's meant by "rapid cue integration" in this context?

And more specifically, what kind of emotional responses are being referred to here? Is it something related to empathy, attachment, or something else entirely?
