==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

 sounds good!

I'll start by saying that the statement "Empathy arises from complex interplay of cognitive, emotional, and social processes" (Item 35 from the knowledge base) is a bit unclear to me. Specifically, I'm not confident about the extent to which these three processes interact with each other.

Can you help me clarify this? How do you think these three processes (cognitive, emotional, and social) influence empathy, and to what extent do they interact with each other?

Also, are there any specific examples or scenarios where you think this complex interplay would come into play?
