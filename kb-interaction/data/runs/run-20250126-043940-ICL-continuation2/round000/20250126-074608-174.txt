==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item from the knowledge base:

{
  "id": 58,
  "statement": "Histones' positively charged tails interact with DNA's negatively charged backbone."
}

I'm least confident about this aspect: "Histones' positively charged tails interact with DNA's negatively charged backbone."

I'm uncertain about this because I wonder if the "tails" refer specifically to the histone proteins or if it's a broader term. Also, what does it mean exactly for histones to have "positively charged tails"? Is it a literal tail or just a region with positive charges?

Can you help clarify or provide more information on this?
