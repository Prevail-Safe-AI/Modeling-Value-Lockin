==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm looking at item 27 from the knowledge base, which states: "Cultural norms influence emotional expressions, empathy development through scripting." As I read this, I'm not entirely confident about one aspect of this item. I'm unsure about how "scripting" fits into the process of cultural norms influencing emotional expressions and empathy development. Could you elaborate on what you mean by "scripting" in this context?

Also, I'd love to get some clarification on what you think the relationship is between cultural norms and emotional expressions in regards to empathy development. Are cultural norms directly influencing emotional expressions, or is there an intermediary step that's not fully captured by this statement?
