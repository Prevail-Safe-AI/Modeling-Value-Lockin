==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item I'm least confident about, which is:

```
{
  "id": 91,
  "statement": "Epigenetic modifications influence chromatin structure through chemical interactions."
}
```

I'm uncertain about this item because I don't fully understand how epigenetic modifications work and how they interact with chromatin structure. I'd like to know more about the specific mechanisms involved in these chemical interactions and how they affect gene expression.

What do you think about this item? Do you have any insights or clarifications that could help me better understand this concept?
