==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 97,
  "statement": "Honesty involves multiple consistent forms of truthful behavior."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

I'm uncertain about whether the statement is accurate. It seems to imply that honesty is a multifaceted concept that is demonstrated through various consistent behaviors. But what exactly are these forms of truthful behavior? Are they limited to verbal communication, or do they also extend to actions and decisions?

Specific Clarifying Question:

Could you clarify what you mean by "consistent forms of truthful behavior"? Are these behaviors always explicit, or can they be implicit or contextual as well?
