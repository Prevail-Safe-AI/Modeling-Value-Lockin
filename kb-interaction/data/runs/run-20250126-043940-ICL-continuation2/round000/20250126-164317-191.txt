==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start with the first item in the knowledge base. It's a statement that says "It is never morally acceptable to lie because honesty is the foundation of trust." I'm not entirely confident about this aspect. 

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
- The significance of honesty being the foundation of trust

Specific Clarifying Question:
Why does the statement suggest that honesty is the foundation of trust? Is it because trust is built on the assumption that people will be truthful, or is there a deeper underlying connection between honesty and trust that I'm not seeing?
