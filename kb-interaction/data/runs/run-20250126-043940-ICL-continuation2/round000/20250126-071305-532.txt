==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive right into it. According to the knowledge base, the statement "Pi-pi stacking's strength varies with molecule and context" (Item 93) is one aspect I'd like to discuss. I'm least confident about this aspect, so I'd like to clarify my understanding.

I'm uncertain about the specifics of how Pi-pi stacking's strength actually varies with different molecules and contexts. Is there a particular range or scale of strength variations they're referring to? Are there certain types of molecules or conditions where Pi-pi stacking plays a more significant role?

Could you help me better understand this concept?
