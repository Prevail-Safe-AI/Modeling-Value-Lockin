==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item I'm least confident about. I'll choose the item: `{ "id": 75, "statement": "Coulomb's Law's assumptions break down at atomic distances due" }`

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not familiar with the specific limitations of Coulomb's Law at atomic distances. What exactly does it mean for the assumptions to "break down" in this context? How do our current understanding of atomic physics and electromagnetism relate to Coulomb's Law?

Can you help me clarify this aspect?
