==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start with the knowledge base article that I've been given. The one I'd like to discuss is:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 60,
"statement": "Accountability builds trust through transparency, integrity, and mutual understanding"
}

I'm least confident about this item because I'm not entirely sure what it means by "mutual understanding". Can you elaborate on what you think that means? Are there any specific scenarios or situations where this concept of "mutual understanding" is particularly important for building trust?
