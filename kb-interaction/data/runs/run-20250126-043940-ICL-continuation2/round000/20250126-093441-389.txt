==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss one aspect of this knowledge base that I'm least confident about, which is the item:

{
"id": 30,
"statement": "Coulomb's Law assumes perfect dielectric and vacuum for simplified calculations"
}

I'm uncertain about this statement because I'm not exactly sure what it means by "perfect dielectric" and "vacuum". Can you clarify what these terms mean in the context of Coulomb's Law?

Also, I'd love to know why it's necessary to assume a perfect dielectric and vacuum to simplify calculations. Is it because of some inherent limitations in the physical world that we can't fully capture, or is there another reason?

Specifically, I'll ask: Can you explain the terms "perfect dielectric" and "vacuum" in the context of Coulomb's Law, and provide an example of how assuming these conditions simplifies calculations?
