==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to ask about the knowledge base we have. I'll choose an item that caught my attention. It's item 96, which says: "Histone-DNA binding involves electrostatic attraction through charge complementarity."

I'm not an expert in biology, so I'd like to know more about this. What do you know about histone-DNA binding, and how does electrostatic attraction play a role in it?
