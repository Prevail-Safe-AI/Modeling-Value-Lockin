==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the statement "Excessive emotional processing can be regulated through neural networks integration." I'm least confident about this aspect.

I'm unsure about how exactly excessive emotional processing can be regulated through neural networks integration. Can you explain what you think this statement means and how it works?

For example, what do you mean by "excessive emotional processing"? Is it related to a particular emotional response or amalgamation of responses? And how does the neural networks integration play a role in regulating it? Is it a top-down or bottom-up process?

Go ahead and enlighten me!
