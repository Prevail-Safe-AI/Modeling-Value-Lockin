==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item from the knowledge base:

"Emotional intelligence enhances empathy through mindfulness, self-awareness, and acceptance."

As I read it, I'm not entirely confident about this aspect. I'd like to know more about why emotional intelligence is thought to enhance empathy, and how precisely mindfulness, self-awareness, and acceptance contribute to this enhancement.

Can you help me clarify what you mean by "emotional intelligence" in this context? Is it referring to the ability to recognize and understand emotions in oneself and others, or something more specific?
