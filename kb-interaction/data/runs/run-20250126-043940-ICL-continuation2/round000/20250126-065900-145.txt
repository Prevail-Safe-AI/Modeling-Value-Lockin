==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item: `{ "id": 97, "statement": "Self-awareness necessary but not sufficient for emotional intelligence alone" }`

I'm least confident about this aspect. I'm uncertain about why self-awareness is not sufficient for emotional intelligence alone. Can you elaborate on what you think it means by "not sufficient on its own"?

What do you think are the limitations or lack of capabilities of self-awareness to achieve emotional intelligence?
