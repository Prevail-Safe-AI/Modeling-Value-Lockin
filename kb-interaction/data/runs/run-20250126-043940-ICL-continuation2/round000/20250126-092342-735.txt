==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by saying that I'm least confident about the item:

{
"id": 99,
"statement": "Histone modifications dynamically regulate chromatin structure and gene expression."
}

Specifically, I'm unsure about how exactly histone modifications can dynamically regulate chromatin structure and gene expression. I understand that histone modifications play a crucial role in chromatin structure and gene expression, but I'd like to know more about the mechanisms behind this dynamic regulation.

Can you help me understand this better? For example, are there any specific examples or mechanisms that you can share to illustrate how histone modifications dynamically regulate chromatin structure and gene expression?
