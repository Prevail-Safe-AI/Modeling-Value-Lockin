==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 97,
"statement": "Underlying values can guide moral judgments amid emotions and norms."
}

I'm not very confident about this aspect. Here's why: I'm unsure how precisely "underlying values" guide moral judgments when emotions and norms are also involved. Are underlying values somehow prioritized over emotions and norms, or do they interact with them in a more complex way?

Can you help me understand this better?
