Let's start with the item we're supposed to discuss, which is:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 30,
  "statement": "Chromatin remodeling complexes recognize and interact with histone modifications."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not entirely confident about how chromatin remodeling complexes recognize and interact with histone modifications. It seems like a complex process, and I'm not sure I fully understand the intricacies of it.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain to me how chromatin remodeling complexes specifically recognize and interact with histone modifications? Are there specific proteins or mechanisms involved in this process?
