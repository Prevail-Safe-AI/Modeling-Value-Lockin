==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, let's take a look at item 66 from the knowledge base:

{
"id": 66,
"statement": "Histones interact with DNA through multi-force interactions."
}

I'm a bit uncertain about this item. I'm not sure what kind of forces are being referred to here. Are they the same forces that are mentioned in other statements, like electrostatic, hydrogen bonding, and π-π stacking forces?

Can you help me clarify what's meant by "multi-force interactions" in this context?
