==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, let's dive into item 90. The statement says "Moral principles are both objective and culturally relative." To be honest, I'm not entirely confident about this aspect.

I'm uncertain because I've always thought that moral principles are either objective (true universally) or culturally relative (dependent on societal norms). The idea that they can be both seems conflicting. It's like trying to reconcile the concept of moral absolutism with moral relativism.

Can you help me clarify this? How do you understand this item, and what do you think this statement means by "both objective and culturally relative"?
