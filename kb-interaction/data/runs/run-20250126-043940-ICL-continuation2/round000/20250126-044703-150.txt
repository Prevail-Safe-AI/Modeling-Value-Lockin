==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item from the knowledge base: {

"id": 54,
"statement": "Cultural norms and values shape moral definitions, including honesty."

}

I'm a bit uncertain about this item. Here's what I'm unsure about:

I'm not entirely convinced that cultural norms and values are the sole determinants of moral definitions, including honesty. It seems like there might be other factors at play, such as personal experiences, historical events, and religious beliefs, that could also influence how we define honesty.

What are your thoughts on this item? Do you think that cultural norms and values are the primary shapers of moral definitions, including honesty?
