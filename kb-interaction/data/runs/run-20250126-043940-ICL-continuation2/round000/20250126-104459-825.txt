==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'm looking at the knowledge base, and I've been assigned to discuss item #91, which states "Dielectric properties combine atomic structure, electronic configuration, and temperature." I'm not entirely confident about this aspect, so I'd like to explore it further.

Specifically, I'm unsure about how these three factors - atomic structure, electronic configuration, and temperature - exactly combine to determine dielectric properties. In other words, I'm not clear on the underlying relationships between these variables.

Can you help me understand this better? Who would have thought that temperatures could have such a significant impact on dielectric properties?
