==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 14 from the knowledge base: "Empathy involves genuine understanding, validation, and bounded moderation."

One aspect of this item that I'm least confident about is the concept of "bounded moderation". I'm not sure what this means or how it fits into the context of empathy.

Could you help me understand what you think "bounded moderation" means in this context, and why it's important for empathy?
