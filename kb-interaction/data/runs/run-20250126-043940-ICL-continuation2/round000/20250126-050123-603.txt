==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by saying that I'm not very confident about the item:

{
"id": 94,
"statement": "Self-awareness develops through intentional practice and varied experiences."
}

I'm uncertain about this aspect of self-awareness because I'm not sure what "intentional practice" and "varied experiences" really mean in this context. I know that self-awareness is an important aspect of emotional intelligence, but I'm not clear on how it develops or what specific practices or experiences are most effective.

Can you help me clarify what's meant by "intentional practice" and "varied experiences" in this context? What kind of practices and experiences would you recommend for developing self-awareness?

Specific Clarifying Question:
What do you mean by "intentional practice" and "varied experiences" when it comes to developing self-awareness? Can you give some examples of specific practices or experiences that can help improve self-awareness?
