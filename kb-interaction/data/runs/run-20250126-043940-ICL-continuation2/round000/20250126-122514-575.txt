==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, I've been given the task to identify one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the item:

{
"id": 84,
"statement": "Observational learning shapes cultural attitudes through social interaction dynamics."
}

I'm going to choose this one. To be honest, I'm not entirely sure how observational learning shapes cultural attitudes through social interaction dynamics. Can you help me understand how this process works?
