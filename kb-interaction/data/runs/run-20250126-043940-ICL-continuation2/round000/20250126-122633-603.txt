==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item #40: "Moral identity forms through ongoing experiential values refinement." I'm the least confident about this aspect. 

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

* How exactly do experiences and values interact to shape moral identity? Is it a continuous learning process?

Specific Clarifying Question:
How do experiences and values refine each other in the moral identity forming process? What are some examples of this refinement taking place?

What are your thoughts on this?
