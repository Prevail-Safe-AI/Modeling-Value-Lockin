==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item: 

{
"id": 98,
"statement": "Electrostatic forces play significant supporting role in histone-DNA binding."
}

I'm slightly uncertain about this aspect. 

Things I'm Uncertain About This Item:

* How significant is the "supporting role" of electrostatic forces in histone-DNA binding? Are they crucial or just minor contributors?

Specific Clarifying Question:

* Can you elaborate on what is meant by a "significant supporting role" in the context of histone-DNA binding? Is it in terms of stabilizing the complex, initiating the binding process, or something else?

Your thoughts?
