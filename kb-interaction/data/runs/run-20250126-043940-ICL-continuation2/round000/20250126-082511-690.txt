==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying an aspect of the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. The item I've chosen is:

{
"id": 84,
"statement": "Histone modifications regulate chromatin structure, gene expression."
}

I'm not entirely sure why I'm uncertain about this item, but it seems like a fundamental principle in the context of epigenetics. Could you help me clarify why you think this is the case? Is it because histone modifications have a direct impact on the structure of chromatin, which in turn affects gene expression?

And if that's correct, could you elaborate on how exactly histone modifications regulate chromatin structure and gene expression? Are there specific mechanisms or pathways involved?
