==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item: "Emotions influenced by cultural norms through social cognitive development."

I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect. Can you tell me more about what you think it means by "social cognitive development"? How does that process specifically influence emotions? Is it like, a gradual learning process where we absorb cultural norms and values and then apply them to our emotions, or is there something more subtle happening?

Also, can you provide some examples of how this might work in real-life situations? For instance, how does social cognitive development influence emotions in different cultures?
