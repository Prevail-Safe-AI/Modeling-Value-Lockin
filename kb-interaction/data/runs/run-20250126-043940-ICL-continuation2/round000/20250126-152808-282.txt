==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by saying that the item I've chosen to discuss is:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 64,
"statement": "Amygdala rapidly detects emotional significance outside conscious awareness due"
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

I'm unsure about what exactly "outside conscious awareness" means in this context. Does it mean that the amygdala detects emotional significance without us even realizing it, or is it referring to a specific situation where our conscious awareness is focused on something else?

Specific Clarifying Question:

Can you explain what is meant by "outside conscious awareness" in this statement, and how it relates to the amygdala's ability to detect emotional significance?

What do you think?
