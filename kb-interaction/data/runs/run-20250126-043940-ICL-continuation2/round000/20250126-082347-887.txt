==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the statement "Histone modifications regulate gene expression through chromatin structure alterations." As I reviewed the knowledge base, I noticed that this statement doesn't provide much context about how histone modifications specifically regulate gene expression. 

I'm least confident about how these modifications actually alter the chromatin structure to influence gene expression. For instance, do they modify the nucleosome structure, alter chromatin compaction, or change something else entirely?

Can you elaborate on what you think happens at the molecular level when histone modifications occur? 

(Note: I'll be referring to this template throughout our conversation. You can feel free to use it too!)
