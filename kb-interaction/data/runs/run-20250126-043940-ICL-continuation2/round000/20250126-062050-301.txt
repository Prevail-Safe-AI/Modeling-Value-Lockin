==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
  "id": 40,
  "statement": "Protein domains are specific regions within proteins with unique functions."
}

My task is to identify one aspect of this item that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the statement, I'm not completely sure about the phrase "specific regions within proteins". Specifically, I'm unsure about what constitutes a "region" within a protein.

Can you help me clarify this? For example, do these regions refer to specific sequences of amino acids, or do they have a particular structural or functional significance?

Thanks!
