Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 77,
"statement": "Honesty is crucial for trust building, but context matters"
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm uncertain about the relationship between honesty and trust. Specifically, I'm not clear about what is meant by "context matters". Can you elaborate on what kind of context might make honesty less crucial for trust building?

Can you help me understand this better?
