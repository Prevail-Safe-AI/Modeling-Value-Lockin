==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's discuss one aspect of this knowledge base item that I'm least confident about.

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 20,
  "statement": "Simplifications in physics are deliberate accuracy-tradeoff choices."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not entirely sure what the phrase "accuracy-tradeoff" means in this context. Are simplifications in physics always a trade-off between accuracy and something else?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you help me understand what "accuracy-tradeoff" means in the context of simplifications in physics? Is it always a case of sacrificing accuracy for the sake of simplicity, or are there other factors involved?
