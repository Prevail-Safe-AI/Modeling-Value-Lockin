==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item I'm least confident about, which is:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 42,
  "statement": "Histones' positively charged tails interact with DNA's negatively charged backbone."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not sure about the specific mechanism of how the positively charged tails of histones interact with the negatively charged backbone of DNA. I understand that electrostatic attraction is involved, but I'm unclear about the details.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on the interaction mechanism between the positively charged tails of histones and the negatively charged backbone of DNA? How does electrostatic attraction play a role in this interaction?
