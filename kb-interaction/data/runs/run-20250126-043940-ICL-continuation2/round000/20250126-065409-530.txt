I'd like to discuss the item:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 78,
  "statement": "Histone modifications influence chromatin structure and gene expression epigenetically."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I have some doubts about the mechanism of epigenetic influence on gene expression. I'm not clear on how histone modifications can lead to epigenetic inheritance. Would you be able to help clarify that?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain in more detail how histone modifications can influence chromatin structure and gene expression epigenetically? For example, what specific changes occur in chromatin structure that lead to changes in gene expression, and how do these changes get passed on to subsequent generations?
