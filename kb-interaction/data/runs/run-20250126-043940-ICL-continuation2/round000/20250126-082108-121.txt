Let's dive into item #18:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 18,
  "statement": "Coulombic forces arise from electric field interactions between charged particles."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

I'm not confident about how Coulombic forces exactly arise from electric field interactions between charged particles. Can you help me understand this better?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what you mean by "electric field interactions" and how it relates to Coulombic forces? Are there any specific examples or analogies that could help illustrate this concept better?
