Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 94,
  "statement": "\u03c0-\u03c0 stacking involves weak, specific interactions between aromatic compounds."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not confident about what exactly constitutes a "weak, specific interaction" between aromatic compounds in the context of \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what makes \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions between aromatic compounds specific and weak, and how does that differ from other types of interactions, such as hydrogen bonding or ionic interactions?
