==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, I'm supposed to identify an aspect of this knowledge base item that I'm least confident about. The item is:

{
"id": 15,
"statement": "Unconscious biases can lead to systematic errors in thinking due to cognitive shortcuts."
}

After reviewing the item, I'm unsure about how exactly "cognitive shortcuts" contribute to systematic errors in thinking due to unconscious biases. Can you help me understand this better?

Specifically, I'd love to know more about what kind of "cognitive shortcuts" are being referred to here, and how they specifically lead to systematic errors in thinking caused by unconscious biases.

What are your thoughts on this?
