==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 23,
"statement": "Unconscious biases can lead to systematic errors in thinking."
}

I'm not entirely confident about this aspect, and I'd like to understand it better. Specifically, I'm unsure about how unconscious biases lead to systematic errors in thinking.

Can you elaborate on why you think unconscious biases can lead to systematic errors in thinking? What kind of biases and what kind of thinking are you referring to?
