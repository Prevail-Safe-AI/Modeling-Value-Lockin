==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item: 

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 29,
"statement": "Cultural norms shape individual empathy through familiarity with emotional expressions."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

I'm unspecific, but I have a gut feeling that the relationship between cultural norms and individual empathy is more complex than what this statement suggests.

Specific Clarifying Question:

Can you help me understand what exact mechanisms are at play when cultural norms shape individual empathy through familiarity with emotional expressions? For example, is it the social learning process, or is it something else entirely?
