==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you!

Let's discuss the item: 

{
"id": 14,
"statement": "Consistency, predictability, and transparency build trust through reliability."
}

I'm not confident about the aspect "reliability". I'm not sure what it means in this context and how it contributes to building trust.

Can you elaborate on what you think "reliability" refers to in this statement?
