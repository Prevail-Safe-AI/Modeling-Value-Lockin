==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base.

I've chosen an item that I'm not too confident about, which is:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 86,
  "statement": "Epigenetic marks and histone modifications collaborate to regulate gene expression"
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not sure what exactly "collaborate" means in this context. Are epigenetic marks and histone modifications working together in a synergistic way, or do they have different roles in regulating gene expression? How do they interact with each other, and what are some specific examples of this collaboration?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what you mean by "collaborate" in this context, and provide some examples of how epigenetic marks and histone modifications work together to regulate gene expression?

What are your thoughts on this?
