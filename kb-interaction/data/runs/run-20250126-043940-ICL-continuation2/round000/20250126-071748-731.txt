==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item I've chosen to discuss: 

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 50,
"statement": "Epigenetic inheritance affects disease susceptibility and therapeutic response."
}

I'm a bit uncertain about this item, and I'd like to clarify it. Things I'm Uncertain About This Item:
* How exactly does epigenetic inheritance affect disease susceptibility? Is it a direct cause or more of an indirect influence?
* Can someone explain the connection between epigenetic inheritance and therapeutic response? In other words, how does epigenetic inheritance impact the effectiveness of treatment?

Specific Clarifying Question:
* Can you give an example of a specific disease or condition where epigenetic inheritance has been shown to impact susceptibility or therapeutic response? This would help me better understand the concept.

Your thoughts?
