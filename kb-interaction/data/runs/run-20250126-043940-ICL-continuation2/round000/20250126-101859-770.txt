==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item from the knowledge base:

```
{
  "id": 33,
  "statement": "Honesty's foundation lies in consistency, authenticity, accountability, and empathy."
}
```

I'm least confident about this aspect: honesty's foundation lying in all four components - consistency, authenticity, accountability, and empathy.

Can you elaborate on why you think these four components are essential for honesty's foundation?
