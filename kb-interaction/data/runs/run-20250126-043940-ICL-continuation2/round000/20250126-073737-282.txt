==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's analyze the knowledge base together. I've identified an aspect that I'm least confident about, which is the item:

```
{
  "id": 63,
  "statement": "Epigenetic inheritance involves DNA methylation, histone modifications, and chromatin remodeling."
}
```

I'm uncertain about how these three components - DNA methylation, histone modifications, and chromatin remodeling - specifically contribute to epigenetic inheritance. Can you elaborate on why these components are crucial for epigenetic inheritance, and maybe provide some examples to illustrate their roles?

Also, are there any other factors that could be involved in epigenetic inheritance beyond these three components?
