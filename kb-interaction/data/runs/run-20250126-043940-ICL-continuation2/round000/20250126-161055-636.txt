==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item:`

{
"id": 45,
"statement": "Emotional salience measures individual perception of emotional significance."
}

`I'm a bit uncertain about this statement. Specifically, I'm unsure about how "emotional salience" is measured or what exactly it means for an individual's perception of emotional significance. Can you help me clarify that? 

Can you tell me more about what this statement means?
