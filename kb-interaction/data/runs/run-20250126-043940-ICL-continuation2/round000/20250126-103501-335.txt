==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into it. Based on this knowledge base item:

```
{
  "id": 35,
  "statement": "Electrostatic and π-π interactions stabilize chromatin structure through non-covalent bonds."
}
```

I'm least confident about the role of π-π interactions in stabilizing chromatin structure. To be honest, I'm not familiar with π-π interactions and their relationship to chromatin structure.

Could you elaborate on why π-π interactions are important in this context, especially as it relates to non-covalent bonds? What specific mechanisms are at play here?
