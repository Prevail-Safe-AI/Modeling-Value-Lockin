==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I think I'd like to start by discussing item 64:

{
"id": 64,
"statement": "Histones modify chromatin structure through PTMs and remodeling."
}

I'd like to share that I'm a bit uncertain about this item. I'm not entirely sure what PTMs stand for, and I'd love some clarification on what exactly "remodeling" refers to in this context.

Can you help me understand what PTMs are and how they relate to histones and chromatin structure?
