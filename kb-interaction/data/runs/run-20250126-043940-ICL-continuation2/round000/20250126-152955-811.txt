Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'd like to discuss item 11: "Emotional connection is a crucial aspect of building trust." I'm not confident about this aspect. What specifically are you unsure about in this statement?

In other words, are you unsure about the importance of emotional connection in building trust, or are you unsure about the relationship between emotional connection and building trust?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

I'm unsure about the relationship between emotional connection and building trust. While I understand that emotional connection is often mentioned as a crucial aspect of building trust, I'm not entirely convinced that it's a necessary condition for trust to develop.

In other words, I'm wondering if there are situations where trust can be built without an emotional connection. For example, in a professional setting, can trust be built solely based on consistency, reliability, and predictability, without necessarily involving emotional attachment or empathy?

What are your thoughts on this?Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.

```"Consistency, reliability, and predictability build trust independently."```
