==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been asked to identify one aspect of an item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. And the item I chose is:

{
"id": 94,
"statement": "GABA's inhibitory effect involves specific receptor-chloride interactions to calm neurons."
}

I'm a bit uncertain about this item because I'm not entirely sure how GABA's inhibitory effect actually works at a molecular level. I understand that GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter that helps calm down neuron activity, but I'm not confident in how it specifically interacts with receptors and chloride channels to achieve this effect.

Can you help me understand this better? For example, what are the specific receptor-chloride interactions that GABA involves? And how does this process contribute to the overall calming effect on neurons?
