==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 72: "Cultural, social, and power factors shape honesty concepts."

I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect. I'm not sure what exactly it means by "shape honesty concepts." Are these factors influencing how people define honesty? Or are they affecting how people behave in terms of honesty?

Could you elaborate on that?
