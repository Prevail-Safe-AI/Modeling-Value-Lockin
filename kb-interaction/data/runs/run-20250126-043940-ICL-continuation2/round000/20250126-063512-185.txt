==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying the aspect of this item that I'm least confident about.

The item is:

```
{
  "id": 78,
  "statement": "Epigenetic inheritance involves non-DNA changes in chromatin structure."
}
```

I'm uncertain about the phrase "non-DNA changes in chromatin structure". Could you elaborate on what that means?
