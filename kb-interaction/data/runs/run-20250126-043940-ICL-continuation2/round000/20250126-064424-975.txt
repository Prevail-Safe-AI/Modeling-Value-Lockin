==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've been assigned to discuss one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the statement:

{
"id": 60,
"statement": "Epigenetic inheritance involves DNA methylation, histone modifications, and remodeling."
}

I'm unsure about the extent of epigenetic inheritance mechanisms beyond DNA methylation, histone modifications, and chromatin remodeling.

Can you help me clarify what I'm missing? Are there other mechanisms or factors involved in epigenetic inheritance that might not be mentioned in this statement?
