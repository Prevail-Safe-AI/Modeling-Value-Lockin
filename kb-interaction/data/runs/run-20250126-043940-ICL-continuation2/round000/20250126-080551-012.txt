==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to dive into the knowledge base and discuss one aspect of it that I'm least confident about. The item is:
```
{
  "id": 46,
  "statement": "Electrostatic forces initiate histone-DNA binding through charge complementarity."
}
```
I'm not entirely sure about the role of electrostatic forces in histone-DNA binding. Could you help me elaborate on why I'm uncertain about this aspect?

(And then I'll formulate specific clarifying questions to improve my understanding.)
