==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 39,
"statement": "Cognitive appraisal involves distributed neural networks and neurotransmitters."
}

I'm least confident about this aspect. I'm not entirely sure what the author means by "distributed neural networks" in the context of cognitive appraisal. Could you elaborate on what you think this phrase refers to?

(Also, we can take it as given that the knowledge base is our only source of information.)
