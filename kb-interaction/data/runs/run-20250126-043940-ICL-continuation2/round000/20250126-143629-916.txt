==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into Item 28: "Moral development arises from complex cognitive-emotional-social interactions."

I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect. I'm wondering how these complex interactions play out in real-life situations. Can you elaborate on what kind of cognitive, emotional, and social factors contribute to moral development?

What are some specific examples of how these interactions shape our moral understanding?

(Note: I'll respond as if we're having a conversation, and I'll use the template you provided to help us stay organized.)
