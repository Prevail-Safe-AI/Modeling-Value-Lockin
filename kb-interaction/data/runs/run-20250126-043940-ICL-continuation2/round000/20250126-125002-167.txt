==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'd like to discuss item 23:

{
"id": 23,
"statement": "Amygdala integrates emotional and social information in moral judgments."
}

I'm least confident about this aspect: how the amygdala exactly integrates emotional and social information in moral judgments. I'm not clear on what specific mechanisms or processes are involved.

Can you elaborate on why you think this statement might be true or might not be entirely accurate? What do you think the phrase "integrates emotional and social information" means in this context?
