==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 22: "Emotions, empathy, and social context shape moral decisions." I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect. Can you elaborate on what it means to "shape" moral decisions? Are these factors necessarily determining or simply influencing moral choices? For example, do emotions and social context always prioritize moral decisions, or can they sometimes conflict with them?

Also, I'm curious about the relationship between emotions, empathy, and social context. Are they distinct but related components, or do they overlap or interact with each other in some way?

What are your thoughts on this item? Can you provide more insights or clarifications?
