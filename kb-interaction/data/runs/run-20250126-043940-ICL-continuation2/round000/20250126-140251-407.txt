==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 27,
"statement": "Amygdala rapidly processes emotional information through direct sensory connections"
}

I'm a bit uncertain about this item. Specifically, I'm unsure about what is meant by "direct sensory connections". Can you elaborate on what this phrase means in the context of the amygdala processing emotional information?
