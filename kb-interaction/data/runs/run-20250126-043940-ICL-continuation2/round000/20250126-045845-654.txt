==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I've chosen an item to discuss, which is:

{
"id": 15,
"statement": "Epigenetic modifications regulate chromatin structure through histone post-translational modifications."
}

I'm not very confident about this item. I'm uncertain about the concept of histone post-translational modifications. Could you elaborate on what post-translational modifications are in the context of histones, and how they relate to epigenetic modifications and chromatin structure?

Also, I'd love to ask some clarifying questions to improve my understanding. Here are a few questions to get started:

* What specific types of post-translational modifications can act on histones?
* How do these modifications affect chromatin structure and gene expression?
* Can you provide an example of a histone modification that's known to regulate chromatin structure and gene expression?

Your insights would be really helpful in clarifying my understanding!
