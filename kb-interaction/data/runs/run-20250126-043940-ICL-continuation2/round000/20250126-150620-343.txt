==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 91 from the knowledge base. The statement "GABA opening chloride channels is complex, multifaceted and not fully understood." is intriguing. 

I'm concerned about this aspect because I'm not entirely sure what it means or how it relates to the overall context of honesty, trust, emotions, and social context. Can you elaborate on why this statement is included in the knowledge base and what it implies?
