==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's take a look at the item: `{
  "id": 86,
  "statement": "Moral development is shaped by intricate interactions among cognition, emotion, and social factors."
}`

I'm not entirely confident about this aspect of moral development. Could you elaborate on what you mean by "intricate interactions" among cognition, emotion, and social factors? How do these factors influence each other, and what are some examples of how they shape moral development?

Specifically, I'd love to know more about how these factors are "intricate" - is there a particular order or hierarchy in which they influence each other, or is it more of a dynamic, reciprocal process? Are there any specific studies or theories that support this idea of intricate interactions?
