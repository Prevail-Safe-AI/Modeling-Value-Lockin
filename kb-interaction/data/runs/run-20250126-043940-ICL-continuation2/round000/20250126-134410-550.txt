==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
"id": 79,
"statement": "Moral judgments arise from VMPFC, DLPFC, ACC, and insula activity."
}

I'm uncertainty about this item. Here are some things that I'm unsure about:

Uncertainty A: I'm not sure how the specific brain regions VMPFC, DLPFC, ACC, and insula contribute to moral judgments. In other words, what specific processes or mechanisms do they use to form moral judgments?

Uncertainty B: I'm also unsure about the extent to which these brain regions are unique to moral judgments or if they are involved in other cognitive processes as well.

So, I'll ask you a specific clarifying question:

What specific evidence or research findings support the claim that VMPFC, DLPFC, ACC, and insula are involved in forming moral judgments? Are there any notable studies or datasets that have investigated this topic?
