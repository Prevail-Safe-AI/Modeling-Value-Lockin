==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying one aspect of this knowledge base item that I'm least confident about. And that item is:

```
{
  "id": 37,
  "statement": "\u03c0-\u03c0 interactions stabilize chromatin structure through non-covalent bonds."
}
```

Specifically, I'm uncertain about what "\u03c0-\u03c0 interactions" refer to in this context. I'm not familiar with the notation "\u03c0-\u03c0" and I'm not sure what kind of interactions these are.

So, my first question to you would be: Can you explain what "\u03c0-\u03c0 interactions" mean in the context of chromatin structure and non-covalent bonds?
