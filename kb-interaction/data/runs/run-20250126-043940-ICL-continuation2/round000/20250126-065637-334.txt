==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with this item:

```
{
  "id": 94,
  "statement": "Electrostatic attraction and histone shape stabilize histone-DNA interaction."
}
```

I'm a bit uncertain about this item. I would like to know more about why electrostatic attraction and histone shape specifically are involved in stabilizing the histone-DNA interaction.

Could you help me clarify this?
