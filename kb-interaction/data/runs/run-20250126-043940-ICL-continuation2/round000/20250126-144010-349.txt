Thank you!

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 20,
  "statement": "Honesty establishes trust through reliability and consistency cumulatively"
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

I'm least confident about the phrase "cumulatively" in the statement. I'm not sure what it means in this context. How does honesty build trust through reliability and consistency cumulatively?

Specific Clarifying Question:

Can you explain what "cumulatively" means in this statement and provide an example to illustrate its meaning?
