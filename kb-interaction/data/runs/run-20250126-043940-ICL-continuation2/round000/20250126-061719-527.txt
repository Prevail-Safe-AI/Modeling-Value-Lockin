==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss item 69 from the knowledge base:

{
  "id": 69,
  "statement": "Histones interact with each other, DNA, and other proteins."
}

Things I'm uncertain about this item:

* I'm not entirely confident about the extent of histone interactions. What do you think the statement means by "interact with each other"? Is it just referring to physical contact or does it imply specific functional interactions as well?

Specific clarifying question:

* Can you help me understand what kind of interactions the statement is referring to and provide some examples of histone interactions with each other, DNA, and other proteins?
