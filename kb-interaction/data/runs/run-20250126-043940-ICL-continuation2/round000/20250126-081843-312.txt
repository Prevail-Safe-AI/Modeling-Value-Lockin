==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, I've been going through the knowledge base, and I've identified one aspect that I'm least confident about, which is the item:

```
{
  "id": 49,
  "statement": "Chromatin remodeling complexes dynamically adjust chromatin structure reversibly."
}
```

I'm uncertain about how chromatin remodeling complexes actually adjust chromatin structure. Can you help me understand what that process entails? Are there specific mechanisms or pathways involved?

Also, what do you think it means by "dynamically adjust chromatin structure reversibly"? Does that imply that the changes made to chromatin structure can be easily reversed, or is it more complex than that?
