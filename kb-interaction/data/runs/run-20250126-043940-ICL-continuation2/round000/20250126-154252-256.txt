==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item:

{
  "id": 12,
  "statement": "Honesty builds trust through authenticity, transparency, and consistency"
}

I'm feeling a bit uncertain about this item. To me, it seems like it's saying that honesty is a necessary condition for building trust, but then it also mentions authenticity, transparency, and consistency as other factors that contribute to building trust. I'm not sure how these factors are related to each other.

Can you help me clarify what this item is trying to say? Maybe you have some insights about how these concepts are interconnected?
