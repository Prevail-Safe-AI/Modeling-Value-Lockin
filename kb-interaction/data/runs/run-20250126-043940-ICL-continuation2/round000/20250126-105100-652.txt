==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. The item is:

{
"id": 38,
"statement": "Credibility, transparency, and accountability intertwine defining honesty"
}

Things I'm Uncertain About This Item:
* I'm not entirely sure what it means by "intertwine defining honesty". How do credibility, transparency, and accountability specifically contribute to defining honesty?

Specific Clarifying Question: Can you help me understand why the item says that credibility, transparency, and accountability "intertwine" to define honesty, rather than just saying they are all important aspects of honesty?
