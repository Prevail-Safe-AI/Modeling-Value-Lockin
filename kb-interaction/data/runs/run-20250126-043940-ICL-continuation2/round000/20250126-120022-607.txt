==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the topic. I've been asked to identify one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. After reviewing the item, I've chosen:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 63,
"statement": "Moral judgments arise from intricate cultural values and individual principles."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
The term "intricate" in "intricate cultural values". What does it mean exactly in this context? How does the complexity of cultural values relate to moral judgments?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what the author means by "intricate" cultural values and how it impacts the relationship between cultural values and individual principles in shaping moral judgments?

What are your thoughts on this?
