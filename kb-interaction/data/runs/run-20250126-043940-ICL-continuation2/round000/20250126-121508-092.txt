==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about.

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 76,
  "statement": "Moral judgments result from dynamic interplay between values, norms, context."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

* I'm not entirely clear on what is meant by "dynamic interplay" in this context. How exactly do values, norms, and context interact with each other to influence moral judgments?

Specific Clarifying Question:

Can you help me understand what is meant by "dynamic interplay" in this context, and what specific mechanisms or processes are involved in this interaction? For example, do values and norms shape each other's influence on moral judgments, or do context-dependent factors play a major role in mediating their effects?

What are your thoughts on this?
