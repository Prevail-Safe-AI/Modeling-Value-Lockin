==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I've chosen one aspect of this item that I'm least confident about, which is:

Item to Discuss:
{
  "id": 25,
  "statement": "Consistency builds trust in relationships, but less in personal ones."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm unclear about the reason behind this distinction between relationships and personal ones. I'm unsure why consistency is more important for building trust in relationships compared to personal ones.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Could you please explain the reasoning behind this statement, especially the part about personal relationships being less affected by consistency? Are there certain aspects of personal relationships that make consistency less important, or is it a matter of degree (i.e., consistency is still important, just not as critical)?
