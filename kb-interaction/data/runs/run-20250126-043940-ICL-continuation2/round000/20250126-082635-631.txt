==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by discussing the item:

{
"id": 25,
"statement": "Non-coding RNAs regulate chromatin structure and epigenetic inheritance."
}

I'm least confident about this item. What specifically are non-coding RNAs, and how do they regulate chromatin structure and epigenetic inheritance?

Can you help me understand this concept better?
