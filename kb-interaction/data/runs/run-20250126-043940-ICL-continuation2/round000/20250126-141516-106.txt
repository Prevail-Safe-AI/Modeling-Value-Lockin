==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to discuss the item from the knowledge base:

{
"id": 21,
"statement": "PFC regulates amygdala's emotional responses through neural modulation."
}

As I read this, I'm least confident about what exactly "neural modulation" means in this context. Can you help me understand what this phrase entails? What does it mean for the PFC to regulate the amygdala's emotional responses through neural modulation?
