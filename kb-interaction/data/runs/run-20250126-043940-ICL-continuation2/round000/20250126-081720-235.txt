==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd love to discuss the item:

```
{
  "id": 98,
  "statement": "Honesty builds trust by proving reliability and authenticity."
}
```

I'm a bit uncertain about this aspect: "how does honesty specifically prove reliability and authenticity?"

Could you elaborate on what you think it means to prove reliability and authenticity through honesty? And are there any specific examples or scenarios that illustrate this concept?

Also, I have a few specific clarifying questions:

* Can you think of a situation where honesty wouldn't necessarily build trust, even if it's authentic?
* How does this statement relate to the concept of moral principles being absolute or relative?

Your thoughts?
