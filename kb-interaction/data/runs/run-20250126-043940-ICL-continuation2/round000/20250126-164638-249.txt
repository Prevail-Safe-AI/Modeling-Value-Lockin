==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Thank you!

Let's focus on item 28:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 28,
"statement": "Trust emerges when emotional stability fosters consistent predictable behavior."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:

* I am least confident about the idea that emotional stability is a necessary condition for trust to emerge.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand why emotional stability is crucial for trust to emerge, and are there any specific circumstances where trust might emerge without emotional stability?

Can you elaborate on that?
