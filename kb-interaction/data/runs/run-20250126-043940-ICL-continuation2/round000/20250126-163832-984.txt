==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item we're supposed to discuss. The item is:

{
  "id": 74,
  "statement": "GABA's inhibitory action reduces neuron excitability hyperpolarization"
}

I'm going to ask you: What do you think is meant by "hyperpolarization" in this context? Do you understand what it refers to in relation to neuron excitability and GABA's inhibitory action?
