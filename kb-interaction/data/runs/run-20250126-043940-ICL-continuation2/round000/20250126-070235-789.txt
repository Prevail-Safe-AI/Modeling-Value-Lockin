==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

So, we're going to discuss the topic about Histone-DNA interactions. Specifically, we're looking at item 34 from the knowledge base:

```
{
  "id": 34,
  "statement": "Histone-DNA interactions involve electrostatic, hydrogen bonding, and \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking forces."
}
```

I'm feeling a bit uncertain about this item. I'd like to know why you think these three types of forces are involved in Histone-DNA interactions. Can you elaborate on that?
