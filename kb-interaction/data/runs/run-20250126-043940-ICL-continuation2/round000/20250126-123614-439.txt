==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'd like to start by identifying one aspect of this item that I'm least confident about. The item is:

{
"id": 25,
"statement": "Moral identity formed through combination of personal experiences and values."
}

I'm not entirely sure what this statement means by "forming" moral identity. Can you explain what it means to "form" a moral identity, and how personal experiences and values combine to do so? Or are there any potential counterarguments or alternative perspectives on this idea that I should be aware of?
