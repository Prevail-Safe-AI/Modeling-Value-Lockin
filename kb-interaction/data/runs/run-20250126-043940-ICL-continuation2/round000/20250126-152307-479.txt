==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start!

The item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about is:

{
"id": 98,
"statement": "Moral development integrates cognition, emotion, and social interactions harmoniously."
}

I'm unsure about this because I'm having trouble fully understanding how these three components - cognition, emotion, and social interactions - harmoniously integrate to shape moral development. Can you help me clarify it?

Specifically, what does it mean for these components to integrate harmoniously? Is it a balance between the three, or is there a specific way that they influence one another?

What are your thoughts?
