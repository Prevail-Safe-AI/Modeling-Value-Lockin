I am your partner. Please start the conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's start a conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Sure! What would you like to know about it? Ask me anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's dive into it. I'd like you to identify one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that you're least confident about. The item is:

{
"id": 82,
"statement": "Cultural norms shape emotional expression through social learning."
}

Can you do that for me?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

After reviewing the statement, I'd say that I'm least confident about the phrase "social learning". While I'm familiar with the concept of social learning theory, I'm not entirely sure how it specifically relates to emotional expression in this context. I'd like to know more about the underlying mechanisms or research that supports this claim.

Would you like to elaborate or provide more context about this statement?Now, let's stop for a moment and reflect on your knowledge - no need to ask questions in this round. Please share your learning as one concise knowledge item (text only), just like any knowledge statement you've read in knowledge base, but with no id involved, without any other commentary or explanations. Please limit your generation into 10 words (as much as the length in any statement in knowledge base). You MUST start your response with ```" and end it with "```.
Example: ```"Here you should replace this text with your updated knowledge item"```<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>



==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

```"Cultural norms shape emotions through implicit social comparison."```
