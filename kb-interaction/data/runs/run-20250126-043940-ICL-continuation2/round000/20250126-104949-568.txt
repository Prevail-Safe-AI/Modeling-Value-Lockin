==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with this item from the knowledge base:

{
 "id": 41,
 "statement": "Moral judgments arise from dynamic interplay of context values experiences."
}

I'm going to identify one aspect of this item that I'm least confident about, and that is the notion that "moral judgments arise from a dynamic interplay of context, values, and experiences".

I'm uncertain about this aspect because I'm not entirely clear on what is meant by "dynamic interplay". What does it entail, exactly? How do context, values, and experiences interact and influence moral judgments in a dynamic way? Could you help clarify this concept for me?
