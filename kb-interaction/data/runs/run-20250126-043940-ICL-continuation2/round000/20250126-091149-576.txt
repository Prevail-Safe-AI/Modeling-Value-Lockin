==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item I chose from the knowledge base. It's:

item to discuss:
```
{
  "id": 93,
  "statement": "Coulomb's Law breaks down at atomic and subatomic distances."
}
```

things I’m uncertain about this item:

I'm not entirely sure what "breaks down" means in this context. Is Coulomb's Law no longer applicable or accurate at atomic and subatomic distances, or is it that the calculations made using Coulomb's Law become more complex and difficult to perform at those scales?

What are your thoughts on this?
