==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start by identifying one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 21,
"statement": "Emotional regulation involves cognitive reappraisal, emotional labeling, and self-reflection."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not entirely sure how these three components (cognitive reappraisal, emotional labeling, and self-reflection) work together to achieve emotional regulation.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you explain in more detail how these three components are interconnected and how they contribute to the process of emotional regulation?
