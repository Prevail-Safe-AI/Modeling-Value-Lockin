==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the first item that caught my attention:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 97,
  "statement": "Moral development arises from interplay between biology, culture, and environment."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not entirely confident about the interplay between biology, culture, and environment in moral development.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand how these three factors (biological, cultural, and environmental) interact with each other to shape moral development? For example, how do biological impulses, cultural values, and environmental influences combine to produce a person's moral compass?

What are your thoughts on this?
