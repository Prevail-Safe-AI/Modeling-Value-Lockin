==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start by discussing item 73 from the knowledge base:

{
"id": 73,
"statement": "Cultural norms shape moral development through social learning mechanisms."
}

I'm a bit uncertain about this item. I'd like to know more about what's meant by "social learning mechanisms". Can you elaborate on this concept and how it relates to the development of moral norms?
