==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

I'll start by identifying one aspect of this item from the knowledge base that I'm least confident about. The item is:

{
"id": 49,
"statement": "Building trust requires sustained commitment to consistent communication."
}

Things I'm Uncertain About This Item:
I'm unsure about the extent to which "sustained commitment to consistent communication" is necessary for building trust. Is it always the case, or are there situations where other factors might be more important?

Specific Clarifying Question:
In what types of situations or contexts might "sustained commitment to consistent communication" not be sufficient for building trust, and what alternative factors might be more important?
