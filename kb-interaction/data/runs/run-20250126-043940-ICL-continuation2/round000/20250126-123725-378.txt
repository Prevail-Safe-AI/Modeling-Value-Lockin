==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base. I'd like to discuss item 14:

Item to Discuss:
{
"id": 14,
"statement": "Moral foundations provide a consistent moral framework despite evolving values and experiences."
}

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not sure how the moral foundations can provide a consistent moral framework despite evolving values and experiences. Can you elaborate on what you mean by "moral foundations" and how they can be consistent despite changes in values and experiences?

Specific Clarifying Question:
How does the concept of moral foundations ensure a consistent moral framework, considering that values and experiences are constantly evolving?
