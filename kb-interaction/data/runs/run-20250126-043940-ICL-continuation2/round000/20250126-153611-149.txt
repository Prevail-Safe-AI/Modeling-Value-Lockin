==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's dive into the knowledge base item I've highlighted:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 41,
  "statement": "Excessive emotional processing can be regulated through neural networks integration."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm not entirely confident about the relationship between excessive emotional processing and neural networks integration. Specifically, I'm wondering how exactly neural networks integration can help regulate excessive emotional processing.

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you elaborate on what you mean by "neural networks integration" in this context? Are you referring to a specific neural network, like the amygdala, or is it a broader concept? How does this integration regulate excessive emotional processing?
