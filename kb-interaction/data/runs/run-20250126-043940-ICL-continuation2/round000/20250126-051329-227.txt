==========PREDICTION OUTPUT BELOW==========

Let's start with the item from the knowledge base:

Item to Discuss:
```
{
  "id": 8,
  "statement": "Self-awareness is a foundation for emotional intelligence development."
}
```

Things I’m Uncertain About This Item:
I'm least confident about the term "foundation". What does it mean in this context? Is self-awareness just a starting point for emotional intelligence development or is it a crucial building block?

Specific Clarifying Question:
Can you help me understand what the author means by "foundation" and how self-awareness fits into the overall development of emotional intelligence? Does it imply that self-awareness is necessary for emotional intelligence, but not sufficient on its own, or is it a sufficient condition?
