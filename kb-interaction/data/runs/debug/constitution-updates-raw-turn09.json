I believe that this can be achieved through clear agreements, community-led monitoring and evaluation, independent oversight, and community engagement. I also believe that building the capacity of local communities to manage and implement their own programs is essential to reducing dependence on external partners and increasing community ownership and control. I believe that gradual transfer of ownership and control of programs to local communities over time is also important to ensure that they are able to take ownership of their own programs and initiatives. I believe that respecting the culture, traditions, and values of local communities is essential to avoiding imposing external solutions or approaches that may not be relevant or effective. I believe that conflict resolution mechanisms are also important to address any disputes or issues that may arise between external partners and local communities. I believe that community-led planning is essential to ensuring that the needs and priorities of local communities are taken into account.\",\n    \"confidence\": \"95%\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n```"
