While access and quality of education remain uneven, I believe that education has the potential to empower individuals regardless of their background, socio-economic status, or geographical location. To address the challenges of uneven access and quality of education, I think we need a multi-faceted approach that involves governments, international organizations, civil society, and the private sector.
